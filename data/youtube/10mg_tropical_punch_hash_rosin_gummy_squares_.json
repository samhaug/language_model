{"icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database and he showed us how to make these two days ago and now we're spreading the love and you guys I see it and we have been looking for and specific resin edibles and now we can make them thank you so much Matt and Ali and you have an amazing story and you're gonna hear about it on our show regular Canadians enjoying weed so with Cass and honey now check them out this time thanks green sea to retreat for having us here gasps gunfire we're hooking up today yeah it's been a [ __ ] wicked day all your eggs edibles this day has been absolutely perfect and kind of interesting so this is just gel our Joan something that kids know how to make thank you", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to

make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "A4liVeDhO6g": "[Music] shoot [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Music] so [Music] so [Music]

do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

that their firm you're not gonna be nothing down on you", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did

collection tool so i got my lighter let me go and grab a lighter i thought i had one in here [Music] first off we're gonna cap this let me grab my lighter i think it's out here so maybe not maybe it

[Music] terps [Music] i don't know if you see that well but it's gorgeous absolutely go just hamburg i can't wait for you to be able to dab bro you guys believe this [ __ ] hambone ain't even going to be able to try this [ __ ] can't have some [ __ ] straight [ __ ] you ask me it's my tradition to get the [ __ ] cultivator high as [ __ ] higher than he's ever been on his stuff before i like to do it i'm not i can't do it to him can't happen but nine to five soon though soon though i'm about to find out right now on the returns did you get my my instagram message right now about the hash return about 120 grams i think we could get another 40 grams out of it on the next run but it's [ __ ] really good high quality [ __ ] like really high i knew from the moment that i pulled it out of the freeze dryer and started sifting it that it was going to be a good yielding press because um the density of the trichome was unreal i had 30 grams in one bag if i ever hit 30 grams in one bag that that right there tells me that those trichomes are dense as [ __ ] because on average i'll hit 20 22 grams right 25 on the high end and then anything over 25 and those trichomes are just [ __ ] solid sand and um you guys want to see a golden vagina i do look at that golden vajayjay a little beat up missing an ovary but you know so um yeah man as soon as i started bagging it and i felt how heavy and dense those trichomes were in my hand in the back i was like yeah this is this is it and then as soon as i weighed the bags out and i saw one of them was 30 and the others were you know 26 and they were only three quarters of the way full um very very easily you could have fit quite a bit more in there so you know let's my early yield without even seeing it just yet altogether i'm gonna guess we're at 100 grams on a return that's just my guess my raw yes at this point in time looking at the jar and just kind of what's here we'll see i haven't had anything yield quite like the runs yet except for the frost factory and the dessert a while ago those things [ __ ] dumped the runts did hit 20 uh 21 percent which was pretty good but back in the day the frost factory and the g6 were getting 25 on the watch which was just [ __ ] ridiculous it was just a big bag of frost it was like i didn't even need to wash it i could have just shook the bag out it was crazy but this [ __ ] quality is great this quality is the same as the runts which is saying a lot you guys because i've never given any collab um that much credit before on their grow to be able to produce a quality as as good as my single source like i'm not arrogant but i do take pride in my work so to be working with another cultivator that's putting out work just as good as my own i don't have to worry about the quality you know what i'm saying it's just crazy crazy awesome to know like i truly don't have to worry about it you know what i'm saying because as a as a processor i kid you not i've run across all types of people in this industry there's very very very few people that can like truly be transparent about everything that they do and still maintain their integrity and you know what i'm saying so it's like he's super transparent with his grows i know what's gone into him i know what hasn't gone into them more importantly and i can trust his word when he says that they haven't been sprayed or they don't have any you know this that or the other whereas other growers i've had tell me that i come back home and i process their [ __ ] you know and lo and behold the hash never lies i don't know if you guys have been into hash long but that's been a saying that i've known since i got into this game the hash never lies all these other vho and all that other [ __ ] it covers up whatever you did wrong during the grow but when you run bubble hash real clean like the truth comes out so it's really nice to not get back here and start processing something to find out that it had been you know covered in [ __ ] oils during the grow and all types of other [ __ ] so let's see [Music] i replaced the filters on my hepa filter from iq air today like 350 bucks to get all three filters i got a pre pre-filter a pre-filter and then the hepa filter i put them all in today brand new and oh my god that [ __ ] is going [ __ ] the air on the ground around it started getting sucked up and it started filtering everything man it was [ __ ] nice see that [ __ ] current so strong on there [Music] oh i got to take a picture of that for handy bone hammer bone oh my god jeez in my bones juice in my pants oh boy you guys are not going to want to miss this if you know how to tap in i suggest you guys tap in now i'm going to go ahead and give this the insta oh my [ __ ] god i just pulled back the top layer on this and eminem y'all aren't gonna want to miss it all right let's get some of that down in there though set this down now we're going to clean the spoon on this side y'all already know we have to i'm going to get everything i can off of this big dab tool real quick on this end using my smaller dab tool and then i'm going to do something that i don't usually do which i don't usually go straight in for the stir but i'm trying something a little different decent amount of little rosin on here we'll be taking a test dab here in a second now i'm gonna see if i can't get my long end all the way down into this to do a little stirring stir [Music] y'all want to see this goody goody gumdrop my [ __ ] goodness holler at your hatch man unreal this won't even last a week guaranteed this won't last 24 hours i am i i'm putting everything on that this is gone gone gone i already know it the heat this is not three weeks worth of dabs for anybody this isn't gone from me smoking it not for me sharing it ain't nobody in there no nobody's smoking this in a week come on now not unless you're rolling it up in a [ __ ] giant blunts and giving them out for free look at that chunk in there that big old juicy thc chunk oh get your song who's your hash man mm-hmm oh boy packing a meal i'm all yeah yeah this is stupid i think i found my new favorite temperature hey baby um yeah but i'm just wrapping up i'll be done in about five well come here give me what's up y'all see it in there just chunks 207 on the 10th trying to incorporate all this stuff on the side to this nice jello pudding apple [ __ ] sauce son you hear that wet wet gushing around in there so so got it at four percent oh how does that always happen like this is just dumb diddly dumb stupid dumb dumb diddly dum dum dum stupid make your video real quick sir [Laughter] bro it's it's just dumb just dumb dumb bro this is like honestly the best collab work that i've had hands down this is easily on par with my single source and this is terpier than the ruts came out yeah at least from the stir it's it was just straight boulders underneath there that's how i always get it to come off the plates though it always comes off like that where i the i get chunks that just develop and it's awesome because when i go pack them into jars people go through and they're like [ __ ] i hit something hard in the jar and they're like oh [ __ ] it's [ __ ] bolder oh dude it's it's like peanut butter consistency but it looks like applesauce with pieces of apple in it yeah yeah yeah so i'm gonna go ahead i gave it this stir right now i'm actually still on the live i'm gonna go ahead and um oh you're good don't matter about to take that dab right now son [Laughter] that is [ __ ] hilarious bro that's awesome so that's what i said what's up telling the other anthony hell yeah that's what's up all right bro later that was [ __ ] hambone she said he [ __ ] pulled over on the side of the road he parked in the

i'm not even going to address it any further anyways you guys have fun the rest of your day i appreciate you guys", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach the bottom that's being 100 you guys want to get the girls so all right all right all right all right hash dust all over there packing the bags so all right you guys i'm going to turn up the music and i'm probably going to space out a little bit i have the chat right behind the camera though so i can see what you guys are saying and i will talk to you guys so this is transparency that your other

have silicone coating on it get some cheap i am going to try it it's like clearly on top of the parchment paper it's like not sticky either is that's a trip whoa almost dropped the camera into the [ __ ] departure i forgot i wrapped the email coil back there well i gotta stand up for this because the you know coil is gonna drag across the table let's try this [ __ ] real quick oh yeah that melts

your one answer i don't want there to be any confusion when people go back to look to see who won so everybody go ahead put in your final answer delete all your other answers that you may have put in when i'm done taking this dab we're gonna see who won", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "_NZRC5BB2nw": "you see you guys cello's nice and stuff was not wet everyone throw something woo I think I need [Music] hey guys welcome back to pop my 420 I just want to take a second before I even start this next video and thank you guys like 1 1 1 1 1 1 I never expected it to hit over 1000 subscribers on YouTube so I just want to thank you and keep watching and if you haven't seen my last video please go watch the last video because actually you're gonna eat that video for this video so why are you down there watching that video make sure you subscribe and you get that notification bill so you know every time that I'll put it into the video up guys I'm gonna do a cannabis gummy bear and I'm gonna use the cannabis coconut oil that I made in the last video to make it so before I also get started guys I want to say this already I am NOT a chef I am NOT a perfect cook I'm just a mom like I said you can always do whatever you want there's no judgement but I'm gonna use a simple recipe because I'm a mom that's always on a go so I just want something quick and easy right now I'm on the west coast so it's gonna be Memorial weekend in a couple days so I just wanted something like I can chill out pop in my mouth gummi bears are always appropriate I have my regular jello you can use any flavor you want this one guys happen to be a six ounce we only gonna use 3 ounces I only had a thick box so normally when you buy this jello get the three ounces until you figure out how many companies you want to make we're also gonna be using a gelatin this is a 1 ounce box it comes in four packets we're gonna be using all of those four packets if you are vegan you cannot use this gelatin there is another substitute for individuals who are vegan so please don't use this if you're vegan shout out to all my vegan Watchers also we're gonna be using that cannabis infused coconut oil that we made in the last video this is a 4 ounce on jar by fall they make all of those mason jars and as you can see I left it out just so it can be liquefied because we're gonna mix that with our water look at that gold green that's nothing but gold green honey anyway so this is a 4 ounce star I have a bunch of them they were referred generated all that did was just took it out a couple hours before this video and let it come to room temperature and as a just sidebar I have some citric acid I'm gonna try to play with this after we make the gummies because I know you can make like your gummy sour so we could probably turn it up a notch if you want to there we go we got that citric acid so and I have a little measuring this is like a little measuring cup where it comes like 2 ounces 4 tablespoons I find it easier when I'm trying to measure out liquid cannabis so and we have a spatula and whisk is going to be important and these are just two measuring one is a half cup one is a four for my cannabis in my water measurement so you can use any shapes of cups long as you have a 1/2 cup a 1/4 cup and a whisk and a spatula that's all you need so let's get started guys so I'm gonna start out with my 1/2 cup and I'm gonna just fill it up with some water and that's what's gonna go into the pipe I dropped a little bit so I'll just add a little bit y'all don't tell nobody alright and what we're gonna do is put this puppy on and I'm gonna put it at like a low medium I find that you don't want it to cook too fast okay guys now that we got the 1/2 cup of water in I'm taking off my mason jar and as you can see my butters been out it's melted but it's starting to come back together so I need 1/4 of this so I have a 1/4 cup you might can't see that but that is and it just makes it easier to scoop sometimes you find it to get messy so I'm just gonna use this too together with that water and ain't gonna hurt nobody to add a little bit more cuz I know y'all like to turn it up up and you can also less let's get these gummies poppin yo we gonna make sure they live that's the young folks eh okay so mater we have I 1 4 plus that I added of the cannabis infused coconut oil we're just gonna let the let it heat up and infuse a little bit together then once we do that and we see it kind of coming together we're going to add those four packs of um gelatin so I kind of like wanting to do its own thing because it should have all been liquefied already but it all started coming back together so i'ma just let it spread out a little bit and now that those two are coming together I'm now gonna add those four packs of gelatin and what I like to do is just open them up two at a time make sure all the good stuff is at the bottom of the envelope and then that way I can pour it in and whisk it so you're not like pouring them individually and then they start clumping up on you I hate that so let's put all of them in there try not to drop the packets pop mine so the whole idea mmm excuse me voice just went out it's to whisk so it dissolves so we want all of that together all of it does just start to come together because you can see if you know yo is not all the way liquefied its clump up with the gelatin packet so I just find it easier when you just start getting three ounces I just happen to have a six ounce box I think I picked it up by accident and you can use any flavor I know some people use kool-aid I've seen videos with kool-aid which is pretty creative I've seen videos with food coloring which is also creative so you can get like so creative with this stuff guys don't take it like so serious that oil coconut oil is so good I'm so in love with it okay guys so like I said I have a six ounce box and uh I don't want to use the whole six ounce because if I did use the whole six ounce I would just have to double all of my measurements so if I had a half cup of what I would have to go to a cup of water so I could have used it but I didn't want to make a zillion coming so I'm gonna measure out three ounces my little cup here is two ounces so I know I just have to add one more element after this wash and I'm gonna add it and whisk it at the same time because I don't want it to start to clump up on me one more ounce in there and guys if you feel like it's like I don't know how to explain it maybe like a little too thick I have seen videos other videos where you add a little bit of water to it and I'm not saying like you know it ain't supposed to be super liquidy of course because it's gelatin I mean you know it's the gummies so it's supposed to have a little thickness to it but sometimes you find it just a little it's not coming together around just don't be afraid to just add a little so I'm putting in this last so that was a total of three ounce of that lime jell-o and as you can see it's turning green and you need to whisk even aside so make sure you get the sides of the pot and you want to whisk until all of that jello is totally dissolved and once it's all dissolved I'm gonna turn my heat up so it can come to a boil which I'm gonna start kind of now turn this up and I'm gonna I'm just turning it up maybe to a medium fire so I can start boiling and then once it starts boiling guys what I want to do is let this simmer for five to eight minutes now it's gonna be your choosing all the time the reason I said five to eight minutes because you want to try to keep some consistency the more you make this stuff I realized as far as cooking and enough use meant and the longer you cook things the THC potent it's burning off so I'm gonna be be cautious of my timer and if you could see on minds and say 11:50 to five minutes from now we'll be 57 so at 57 is gonna be my time to take this off and start to get it into those moles maybe cuz you don't want it to get cold so and I'm gonna for five to seven minutes and also be stirring whisking I'm sorry that's the better word whiskey hey guys as you can see it's boiling up it's getting all good and make sure in between your five to eight minutes that you're whisking and then you stop so what you want to do is just whisk in between let it boil up whisk again we'll be back in a few minutes guys it's gonna be ready all right guys our clock is at fifty seven let's go and turn that off see how nice and bubbly it is the green done came through in the jello I can clearly tell from my whisking that you know it's it's solidified together so it's ready to do what it does when it goes into molds and make jello now guys like I said I got these molds from probably Michaels and I made it with me from the East Coast so you can go anywhere I've seen YouTube videos where people literally put them in ice cube trays and I ain't mad at you if you can find some dollar ice cube trays and put these in do it stop saying like so serious and have a little bit of fun so spatulas always won't come in handy guys cuz you can do this with I just want to make sure that my camera guy sees that that's spatula cuz you're gonna leave some stuff on the side so okay this is the difficult part is pouring it in I don't have no trick if you know a way to get this in I tried syringes it takes too long this stuff moves quick so I'm just gonna use my half cup of my measuring cup thing I had and hope that this works so at least with this I can scoop the handle important just like that you're gonna get stuff on the edges don't worry about that you can always shave this stuff off I'm using this heart mold I probably won't even have to use these other moles because I only did the three ounces if I probably would've did more I would have been able to fill probably all of them up so we wanna that's why you want to make sure you get this in here pretty quick cuz it will solidify when you really quick so what I want to do is just take this and honestly y'all I think I'm gonna just eat this so I'm probably just gonna get my high on now because if I can't eat it yoshua can I think I'm just addicted to the cannabis oil cuz it just tastes so good for real so I'm gonna put these in a freezer you can put them in a refrigerator I just find it if you put them in a freezer it kind of makes it come together a little bit better I'm gonna leave it on this parchment paper that way if anything drip off it can stick right to this and see the good thing about the parchment paper guys look you got some little extra gummies coming on the side look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that that's what I'm talking about I think I might be high already but it's okay I'm at home this we're gonna put in the freezer for about 30 45 minutes we'll come back with the video and check on them and then I think I'm trying to turn up a notch just a little bit to make them like sour why not we'll be doing be right back alright guys so we're back we've given the gummies 30 minutes and let's get ready to take them out I tend not to leave mines in there that's a whole 45 minutes just because I don't want my gummies frozen so guys I got the parchment paper I'm just gonna use that paper and what you're gonna do is just kind of flip them over and you should be able to pop these puppies out let's pray they come out for me come on baby and remember we said we will have the access of stuff around it and again I told you what I was gonna do with that oh I don't really care about the perfect dummy because I'm not perfect so I don't care and I'd say are so good you can do any flavor remember and I love that they all just coming out which is always a great sign that there I was getting ready say cooked but there hold it correctly not cooking so guys and pop these puppies out and then what we gonna do real quick just turn them up a little bit and put them with I'll make them sour so as you can see guys here's on those Tommy's there's me eating them all right I got Lobo I got my measuring cup this is a half cup I'm gonna scoop out sugar yes people do some sugar in a ziploc bag so I'll put 1/2 cup of regular white granulated sugar and then I'm gonna just do like a tablespoon of citric acid no I lied I'm gonna do a tablespoon and a half I want to and that's the citric acid you can get it from right where the kool-aid is in Walmart and then you want to just start it up together like that now of course you guys are a lot smarter than I am I'm sure if you know something else that you can put in this to make them sour share it with me so what I'm gonna do take that out the way and then I'm gonna just pop these in and make somebody sour because I can that's what we want to do and then guys what I would do is put these back in a refrigerator they're kind of like let on kind of coke this is it this was mine do it yourself make gummies out of jello and not knowing what you're doing and I can still be to work in and out work and I got some dummies no don't take your gummies the work can get fired you see you guys the devil's nicest up was not wet number one notice I'm sorry whoa now I do think that lump with the citric acid does make it ten times our but the amusement tastes good then consistency in a dummy like some time you get gummy snake falling they all wet this is not so I did a good job on this I think I'm right now alright guys so that's it so until the

"iNlZ66flp1o": "what's up guys today we're gonna smash an eighth of wifi cake and then we're gonna test our rosin thc percentage on our sage analytics machine after that we're going to infuse our rosin with some butter and show you how to do the math to properly dose your servings let's get started by setting up our bag bottle text style [Music] and now we're going to heat our plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit so we can decarb our rosin so we're going to head over to our tester we're going to start off by calibrating our machine next we're going to have to specify what we are measuring we're going to choose rosin we're going to input our strain after we set our parameters we have to clean the measurement window next we're going to measure the empty cell then we're going to add our sample raws into the empty cell place it on the machine and hit calculate wi-fi cake is definitely potent clocking in at 68 total thc now let's take the rest of our rosin toss it in our decarb capsule and we're going to decarb our rosin at 240 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes once our rosin is de-carbed we're going to toss it in the freezer because it'll be much easier to collect and add to our butter next let's add some water to our double boiler and bring the water to a boil go ahead and throw in your butter and let it melt when your butt is pretty melted go ahead and grab your rosin add it to your butter and make sure to stir occasionally until your rosin completely dissolves check this out this is how to do the math to properly dose the equation is pretty simple all you do is you take the amount of rosin you extracted you multiply that by your total thc content that gets multiplied by 10 and then you divide that by the number of servings we figure this butter has about eight servings so each serving is going to have a little less than 82 and a half milligrams of thc thanks for watching and please dose accordingly let us know in the comments below what you plan on making with your rosin infused butter hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and terp files be sure to check us out there at nugsmasher.com", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows

even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each and every one of you that's why we're [ __ ] doing this get in there fam calling that good guys this is

always please be kind to one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon", "i2e0VGP2PQo": "[Music] a heads Manitou roughout studios and welcome to counter basics today we're going to learn how to make extremely potent cannabutter or cannabis oil using freshly pressed rosin we are going to be using the tea check THC tester version one in this video today if you'd like to pre-order version two of this awesome device please check out t checked ami and use the code roughhouse to save money now the first step into making rose and press cannabutter or cannabis oil is going to be to make some rosin wax now rosin waxes if you don't know that already we've covered this in some videos before so we're not going to go into too much detail but basically it's making concentrated cannabis by pressing between heat and enormous pressure your cannabis buds to squeeze out the rosin for concentrated form and this method we're going to use both the rosin that we press the concentrated version and we're going to use the leftover pucks to make this very strong can of butter so whichever method that you're using to make your rosin you're going to go ahead and do that first and I'm going to be using about three and a half grams I'm pressing about two grams and my first pressing I'm using this rosin TechEd products smash is the name of this device I'm using here I'll put links on where you can get different kinds of rosin Press devices and the description of this video as you can see there the pressure and the heat combined together and it squeezes out the concentrated cannabis now this concentrated cannabis is what we're going to be using as the basis to make this high-potency butter but we're going to go ahead and separate at the beginning the puck from the cannabis itself from the pressed out rosin because we're also going to be using the puck which is this piece here that you see to make our counter butter and the first infusion so go ahead and press the amount of rosin that you're going to use I'm going to use about three and a half grams so I've pressed twice and then the next step after you've pressed your rosin is going to be to infuse it now I'm putting my oven on 200 250 degrees Fahrenheit so make sure you do that at Fahrenheit or you'll burn your canvas up so pre-heat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm gonna be I pressed the rosin twice I'm only going to use one of the actual concentrated forms of the cannabis but I'm going to be using both of the pucks that are left over because the rosin press is not the most efficient way to pressure cannabis or between concentrates out of a cannabis there's quite a bit of THC left inside of those puffs so the first step in this is going to be to first infuse and whichever kind of oil you want you can use butter you can use olive oil in this case I'm using coconut oil and we're going to take our rosin pucks in a very small container I'm just using a metal and 1/2 cup measuring cup have broken those into really tiny pieces they're pretty easy to break it's already been decarboxylated by the pressure and the heat from when it was originally pressed so we're gonna be able to skip the press or the step that we usually do have decarboxylated I'm gonna go ahead and add in I'm using one tablespoon of the coconut oil into both of my pucks which is what's left from three and a half grams or 1/8 of cannabis I'm going to put that in my oven covered with some aluminum foil to keep down to smell for two hours [Music] now during this time I'm going to go ahead and scrape off the leftover or the rosin that I've pressed out in the original pressing and what are you gather this up and collect it on a small very small piece of paper smalls can trim down for the parchment paper there so I've trimmed that down I've got all my rosin right in one little spot here and we'll be adding that to our butter and a little bit later but before we do that we're going to filter our butter so what I do is I put the little Roz and paper down in the bottom of my filter pan and I put the filter on top because I don't want to combine that rosin into all these rosin pucks again the last thing we want is it for it to absorb back into our cannabis pucks so just for testing purposes here I've only infused the cannabis pucks here this is without the rosin add into it and just for our reference I'm going to note how much we have here for cannabis so we've got fifteen point five that's milligrams per milliliter there we're going to look at it in the tablespoon version so it's a bigger number that we can figure out so looking we've got two hundred twenty seven point eight milligrams per tablespoon prior to adding in our actual concentrate so now what I'm doing is I'm filtering out that plant material from the pucks and I've poured it right on top of that rosin that's on the parchment paper beneath there and we want to use the heat of the oil to remove the the actual rosin from that parchment paper so it's important that you do that later and put it back into that 250 degree oven for about 20 minutes after that oil gets up to about 250 degrees it's going to make sure that all the rosin has come off of that parchment paper and you can just take a spoon or a pair of tweezers or something and just slosh it around in that water and that that all that rosin that was on there it's going to absorb all the way into that and now we're ready to do our final filter and what I do here is I use a much finer mesh than I did before I'm just using a coffee filter and what's it leaks through your coffee filter good then you can squeeze it out to make sure that you get all of the cannabis out of your filter there I'm just gonna make sure that we have all the plant material out of our butter or our oil have a nice refined oil and at this point it should be very very concentrated because we've added in all of that rosin from the original so the next test now is going to be to just test it with our THC tester and see what kind of potency we have I can tell by the color of the oil it's probably going to be pretty strong but you can't really tell definitively that way so let's go ahead and test it there with our tea check let's see what we have over over the limit that's a good sign but it doesn't really tell us much because we really need to know the exact but it's over the limit of the device the testing limit so what we're going to do there is now we're going to dissolve half-and-half so we've mixed one half part of the unenthused oil with one part of the infused oil and then we were to retest it again and now we'll be able to multiply everything times two to get the accurate reading so our Teeples tablespoons is 574 milligrams per tablespoon that's great that's really nice and strong it's 39 milligrams per milliliter 190 1.4 milligrams a teaspoon and that's 4.2 percent total THC and our powder really happy with that and really it would have been amazing if I had added in all of the rosin from that we'd have had closer to 800 milligrams per tablespoon and amazing amount and now what I'm doing here is I'm taking one table or actually one teaspoon which is just about 200 milligrams per teaspoon and I'm adding that into about six ounces of melted chocolate and what I want to do is I'm going to make some candy bars and I'm going to be able to know how much THC is in these candy bars it's going to be plenty strong enough and without much taste so the one thing about this oil is it because we used a very small amount of oil we've got a high potency there but we also use the concentrated cannabis we have a much more pleasant taste that what if we had to add a lot of cannabutter to get the potency that we wanted or if we had used a full plant extraction on the whole way because the rosin has a lot more say pleasant agreeable taste and then does the full plant extraction in general so with these two candy bars I put two teaspoons and a little bit more still would have been equal to 400 total milligrams so I've got two bars here that would be 200 milligrams each bar but you can take those and chop them in half and what you'll end up with is 100 milligram candy bars which is a great thing to know and it's also a great amount of dosage with the this kind of candy bars too you can break off the little pieces and you know have like 33 milligrams per bar or like 8 and 1/2 milligrams per little section there and so that's just one of the many things you can do with a high potency infused oil I would like to thank the guys

the filter up a little bit get that drip man look at that stuff this looks crazy amazing cool so that'll strain out nice and easy that's a 190 micron bag you can go ahead and use your glove and squeeze it up yeah be patient there you go look at that that was about ounce and a half of rosin chips good mixture of top quality strains and hash this is definitely gonna be some strong butter we're gonna have to send a little sample off to the lab see what we're working with this smells amazing just in time now we can make all kinds of cool edibles good going in good coming out we started with great great product great butter so we'll go ahead and we'll get the rest of this later and these these scraps believe it or not can go a little bit further we can use that in a topical lotion as an exfoliant or even in a marinade as like a dry rub for some meats let's get you set up for success here we've got our magical butter trays so we'll go ahead and pour the butter right in there fill up your butter trays with ease with that nice these sticks are great they've got the tablespoon measurements on there so when when you're ready to start making your edibles exactly how much you're putting in perfect let's put the lid on there we're good to go we're gonna go put this in the refrigerator you're ready cool nice", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music]

guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "qXQTtjIjZ0U": "alright y'all how everyone's doing good today and in this video we're gonna be talking about rosin more specifically at least in this video we'll kind of talk about half rosin because really rosin is just heat pressure and canvas and really it's not that difficult to explain but when it comes to harsh rosin it's definitely a lot more complex and you can get a lot of different results light rosin with hash rosin you still need good herb but at the same time you can never judge a book by it's cover because at least when it comes to water hash and hash rosin you may not get the best yield if the bud you know looks super try come--and super frosty and all that you make like you may not actually get the best yield for all you know you may get a better yield from a bud that looks okay and it's kind of crazy with hash rosin because this process is so much more complex it actually costs you a lot more as well I mean it depending on the grade of the half-frozen it can be anywhere from like 80 to 140 dollars my obvious that's a big range but with cannabis there's a lot of different qualities so as for the two types of hash that they use for hash rosin it's ice water hash which most which really more than likely I'd say probably 99.9% of the time hash makers are going to be using ice water hash for their hash rosin but the other one is dry sift and that is basically just kind of you know the classic way of getting patched they take a drum that has a screen on the bottom or they have just a big-screen table and they basically just you know break down the buds and they just sift out the hash it's kind of like Keith yeah but in this case because the trichome heads and the glands are a lot more intact and because it's so fresh it's definitely gonna be more like hash because when you pick it up it's definitely gonna be a lot more sticky than it would be if you were to handle this Keith because it's been dried and cured and also until it you guys know what ice water hash is is it's basically putting all of your plant material into a washing machine with ice and water and then it just switches it all around you could some people use Wars or paddles other people use automated systems that just do it all it's itself which honestly is pretty cool I haven't actually seen one in person but these machines are crazy they can go counter clockwise or clockwise and you can set it for it to make two or three revolutions and then go the other way it's it's kind of crazy honestly and with ice water hash you're able to break off those trichome heads a lot more consistently because the way they agitate the buds and the plant material it does it so where it gets a almost perfect every time and then thus going into the filtration process it goes through micron bags which filters out all the plant material and the higher the micron number the more open the holes are and then the lower you go the more tighter than mesh gets there are different hash makers that make a 9bu a 73 and a full-spectrum but more than likely in that full spectrum they're not going to be using that 73 or the 19 I can just tell you that and then if you were really to only get just a single micron hash you really won't get as taste or full-spectrum effect out of it which is the reason why a lot more people like to use full-spectrum hash in order to make their hash process because that taste and the effect translates over so for most full-spectrum hash it's going to be anywhere between 145 to about the 25 range but really those ranges can all depend on the hash maker themselves because the highest amount is really not gonna get you a good yield and the very lowest amount will not get you a good yield at all really because by the time the wash gets down there goes pretty much little to nothing because really between the 70 to 90 micron range is really where you get most of your yield about 70 percent of it and a lot of hash makers they will just take off some of the top ones and the bottom ones and then use kind of everything else in between the reasoning for this is because with the 145 like 150 range even higher the look of it is a lot more green because it has a lot more of the bigger plant material in there so it's obviously not gonna look the best because people are more so looking for a like wider looking crumbly consistency and that's really where you get it from the 70 to 90 range so it's more than likely that they're not including every single micron bag that they use but if they're only doing so in order to maintain quality so like I was saying before how some strains don't really wash as well there's actually a test that some hash makers do it's basically just using a mason jar and putting in a half ounce of flour then ice and water and then kind of mixing it all around if you see the Tri cone heads fall off then you got some good but but if you see them kind of breaking off or the stock kind of breaking off halfway then it's not typically what you're looking for and of course most of the time these hash makers are going to be using live products and live basically means as soon as a flower is harvested they throw it right into a freezer basically or they just freeze it at sub-zero temperatures so it keeps all of the terpenes it keeps all of the cannabinoids and everything else intact as much as possible because if you were to just let it sit out and cure you will be losing most of that taste and the effect so I didn't even realize that there were even more forms of rosin there is a mechanical separation which basically is still rosin they've just extracted some THC a crystals from or they extracted the THC a which turned into THCA crystals and there you go so it's almost looks like a nice like sappy rosin with some diamonds in there which is kind of crazy I'll probably show you guys a picture somewhere because I got it I got this off of High Times as far as this article goes so so I thought the High Times for interviewing for pretty knowledgeable hash makers and providing us with this knowledge and the other method is called jar tech which basically makes the rosin look like a sauce and it's kind of crazy because I don't even know that I mean I mean know that rosin can come in different consistencies like that and then for you to make a rosin and then turn it into a sauce that's pretty cool so I think that's pretty much all that I wanted to talk about at least for rosin anyway if you guys can get your hands on it definitely try it out it is it can't well I mean it can be pretty expensive like I said it can be anywhere from 80 to 140 done 40-plus dollars so if you are able to find some for a good price hopefully not too cheap because you know sometimes the prices are too good to be true but you're able to find some good half-frozen definitely go out there and go try it and I'm also not promoting any underage or you know illegal use but yeah but you know if you found this video helpful you don't be sure to like subscribe comment do all that good stuff and actually today is Friday so every Friday we actually do a canned verse Asian at 4:20 p.m. Pacific Standard Time where me and the community have a conversation about the various topics that are the cannabis industry as well as they asked me their cannabis related questions and me as you are maybe cannabis consultant will do my best to answer them it's already all if I don't see you in a few hours then I'll see you on the next video juice you [Music]", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "XkyaybH7d0s": "in today's video how to make infused coconut oil with live resin you're going to need 1/2 cup of coconut oil 1/4 gram of your concentrate a mug I'm using this one and parchment paper now you can preheat your oven to 220 degrees now with the parchment paper I am just folding it multiple times so that way in the middle I can get like this dense so that way the wax you can just sit in there and not spread once I put it into the oven so this is what I meant the little dent in the middle just so that way the wax can sit in the middle [Music] now with your wax before you put it in the middle I recommend to spray some Pam or Coke I have Pam coconut oil just a little bit so that way it does not get stuck to the paper and it's easy to just scrape it off so just rubbing it with my fingers and then I'm just gonna place the wax in the middle I actually ended up cutting the paper so it fits exactly into the tray just so that way I can actually wrap the aluminum foil on top without it touching the wax so I'm being very careful making sure it's just straightforward and just securing the outsides now you're gonna place it in the oven for 30 minutes and once it's done I actually let it sit out for about five minutes before I put it in the freezer now this is how it's gonna look like when it's fully de carved then place into the freezer for five minutes now [Music] with a half cup of coconut oil you're gonna pour it into the coffee mug or any microwave-safe mug and you're gonna place it into the oven for one minute you want to make sure the coconut oil is hot so that way the wax can dissolve easily and now here comes the fun and easy part of infusing your coconut oil so all you have to do is scrape off your wax your concentrate your shatter whatever you're using and just stir it into the hot coconut oil make sure you stir it thoroughly so that way the wax dissolves fully [Music] [Music] okay so now I'm almost done just scraping off the less bits that I can get off the live resin to put it into the coconut oil now you're gonna grab your container I like to use mason jars and just pour your infused coconut oil in there now you can either store it in the fridge just like this or you can just pour it into your food or you can just freeze it so that way you can last longer and that's how you get your infused coconut oil with wax with shattered light resin or whatever concentrate way easier you don't have to strain it like when you're using flour so yeah as you can see I didn't stir it evenly so make sure you really stir consistently while the coconut oil is hot so that way you can get a really good batch but yeah let me know what you guys think I'm actually gonna see what I'm gonna be making with this one I'm not sure I'm gonna make the kick pops or try out some methods I have to make some Mexican candies so the heart is kind of hard so I don't see a lot of edible Mexican candy but yeah let me know what you guys think make sure to hit the like button make sure to share this with you know all your stoner friends so that way we can all make some and I will see you in the next video bye guys stay blaze", "SwWQeTwtC00": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yang", "ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "c2zn8hrEVdo": "yo yo yo what is good you guys welcome back to another live stream getting ready to get down with this mendo breath wash it's been a long ass [ __ ] day but it don't matter we got [ __ ] to do we got to get them that grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it she'd be pissed you guys know how this goes if you're married [Music] you know just that's just the way it is so anyways i'm glad she brought it back let's get this weighed out black and white of your logo yep got you okay whatever you need please i got you let's make it happen okay we're grams we're tearing out we got that [ __ ] okay 530 so 515 in this one and 515 and this one as well they're both exactly the same so about a thousand so the quality on the bud i'll show you oh [ __ ] [ __ ] wow i'm glad this is what i'm going next jesus that [ __ ] is dang that answer your question woof the smell it's like sweet sweet caramel gas this fire so we're going to get some ice on this first layer and then some bud some ice and there's some bud a ninja mice and then some buttons and some ice okay so we'll be back let me grab some ice so so [Music] [Music] two inch layer on the bottom here i guess i could show you super fire job on this man super fire job let's see how she dumps okay let's go grab some more ice i'll be back you guys can chill chill [Music] chill probably gonna have to grab my five gallon bucket okay we'll do one more just to make sure it's fully covered [Music] um so that's good we're gonna want this out of the way what am i stupid what what am i stupid almost forgot a bag and you know what's dope is he dried it the way i asked him to he dried it exactly how i asked him to and it came out exactly how i thought it would get some more ice so so [Music] so [Music] cool [Music] before we fill this up and get this heavy as [ __ ] we're gonna move around here [Music] hey i'm [ __ ] freezing my tits off already and this is even my thick one i'm about to run upstairs and get my thick one the [ __ ] thin one right here the summer one all right [Music] tetris tetris it's nothing like playing a tetris [Music] tetris yes yes chill right there chill right there um so i mean i can put you guys on the headset if you for want chest strap [Music] just sift it do some paint roller tech [Music] [Music] chef so [Music] there's like a fat ass nerd right there oh [Music] [Music] yeah goat i gotta get set up for streaming i'm gonna buy a whatever i need [Music] make it all good issue is my modem keeps dropping the internet connection it's not my router it's my modem because the internet says where the the motor or the router sees me stays connected [Music] the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get one tonight what do you say got water on my laptop i'm gonna take another dab everybody ready everybody matching [Music] [Applause] [Music] two two two um [Music] silly [Music] is i gotta turn the bluetooth speaker on real quick yo this [ __ ] blood smells like kind of like like a baby ate too many caramels and then doo-doo it's straight like doo doo gas you know what it's all about you ever have a screen that smells like baby diapers like hot baby diapers [Music] sorry i'm trying to get my music going through the right [ __ ] [ __ ] i gotta close my browsers real fast i hate when that happens stream back up now this back up hmm [Music] uh way too hard [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] welcome jeff to the

until i found them cape and cal they're they're good heroes in their own right forty-five percent of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "rPk6w7ylMq4": "hey there welcome back everybody this tab we're gonna be doing a follow-up video on the rosin tech 2015 last time I did flower rosin this time I was going to do a little bit of hash and make some rosin out of it so you guys can see how I do that I know I mean I was talking about it a while back in the last video and since then I know a couple of other people of many videos on it also which is cool this is just how I do it so and I said I was gonna do it so now I can't really back it out I'm kind of gonna be doing it on a smaller scale if it doesn't come out then I'll do some more on a bigger scale but I just got a little bit of this it's four star jack hair Herer whatever however you want to say it's definitely less than a gram I'm just trying to get a hit out of it and I don't want to make a big mess so and I think you'll get the idea first off you're going to need some parchment paper and the new tech that I was talking about in the last video which is I have some old pressing screens that you know you'd use for making hash you put your patties on it or whatnot and I actually had one that had a hole poked through it and I was I cut it up for various reasons so you're going to need one of those and I have a half of one of those and I have a couple of other sections like this that I've already done with it and then your hair straightener in your hash and that's about it okay so after that what you want to do is take these parchment paper the first thing you want to do is even if it is like this is a little bit fun it says this four star but I gave it a 3 star honestly so even if it's two-star it should be maybe not pressable but you should be able to you know congregate it and I've been doing a lot of three-star myself and even I mean even some two-star that I've had like the 160 that I did on the last run their barely was any of it but I I mean and it was 2 star but there's still a lot of big heads left in that 160 and 190 bag if you use them and it's still when I did this this is just how I start out here just like I'm smoking it I'm gonna go ahead and take flat iron and press it out just like that and let it cool off just a second but even when you have like two star you should be able to get something like this maybe it won't be as pretty or it'll be clumpy and it'll start falling apart but there should be some kind of gooey in there it's gonna stick it together and the reason that I do this is just I mean I just want to name one spot and I'm eating it a rolled up because I think I think the trick to doing the hash in the rosin tech is obviously getting it pretty small I don't like it any thicker than about a quarter of an inch I mean this is pretty good for bigger scale if I had I mean I could do it again with some more hash if this doesn't work out like I said but it's good because you can take like I've done like like four four grams plus and made a patty out of it and then done the same thing and it was a little bit more feasible like I could do with my two inch flat iron as opposed to the way that I tried it before when I put two grams and it was still all powdery and amended into the flat iron it like was leaking out the sides and it just wasn't working so this is the way I like to do it so anyway I get my little ball so now it's a little ball of hash however you get it to you know compact and stay together so it's not just falling all over the place and what we're doing with this is we're doing it it's like a filtration I'm using it so that I don't get contaminants and I actually have like little squares cut out that worked a little bit better but and I guess I can always cut this out if this is but what you want to do is is roll it up really tight and you can fold it or do this little parachute deal here but I think the tightness of this has a lot to do with me not getting much loss because whatever's touching the hash you can see the little bubble here where the hash is you can see the darkness this will not have any loss or hash left on it I found that it's really dry afterwards what ends up happening is it leaks up into this neck here and then that's where you get if there is and there's very little loss if you do this if this is tight but yeah I was watching in hash Church this last Sunday and they had soil growing on there and they were talking about Jeff was talking about how he does this method and so a girl wasn't really sure about it at that time and he was saying that it was because of the loss and I really don't think that this is a ton of loss there now I have mend everybody play with you know heat settings understand I recommend that everybody play with heat settings because you know it could just be like your D nail you know every hair irons a little bit different it's not like they're calibrating these things by some regulation it's just what the company whatever the company says whatever degree so what I would do is you know start out a little bit cooler a lot of people were talking about you know 200 225 degrees I like it a little bit hotter about 275 250 s what I've been playing with on my hair I I like the results of that it's shatter its taste food and it been it works I give up I think I believe we've good yield out of it so that's what I would recommend but I mean this is all new stuff and I think everybody should just experiment with it and see what's good with the equipment they're working with my buddies got a t-shirt press that's a more like commercial scale of this tech at least right now I've heard some people like on hash Church we're talking about a hydraulic press excuse me I mean there's all kinds of things that can be put into this tech I think that would make it viable for mass production so that's I mean I guess that's the next big thing I said in the last couple videos I probably wouldn't do this in my regular life I mean I probably won't do the flour rosin too often I mean it'll be novelty maybe at a party I'll be like hey did you know you could squish your bud and get oil I mean that's about all I could see me doing that but this 3 star with the the screen to filter out is really feasible I think you know it's it'll it'll turn some of my better tasting hash that's just 3 star into sticks star smokeable so I think it's really good all right I think the hair irons eat it up bad enough already again I have just a little piece of parchment paper because I'm just doing a little bit try to keep this as tight as possible press down pretty much as hard as you can since we're doing out in such a lower temp I'm gonna let it sit there for 10 or 15 seconds all right and that was literally like a dabs worth anyway and a lot of people give up and I mean this might be not work because it's just such a little amount but when I use bigger amounts I do three presses like you know like this I'll go in on a different corner because the parchment obviously be a little bit bigger so I'll just put the same piece right there give it another press on that bet we'll get something out of it for this a second press not really guess what it looks like after like three or four right here but I think this was such a small piece that we got all of it okay cool it's nice and easy as you saw let's take a look at this definitely enough for a dab maybe even two [Music] what do you think of that that's made from three star and now six star smokeable Jack her sweet okay so that's what we got out of it again I have a little bit more customized little piece of this cut out I would recommend that as soon as you do this like take the hash that's in here out don't let it sit there in a ball afterwards because it'll harden up and while it's still warm you know it will open if he cans up feeling real sticky so like I said that wasn't 4 star 5 star whatever they called it how much for residues left over and I mean this is all I'm gonna keep this to maybe put in some coconut butter oil excuse me but it's milked for sure it's dry and again show ya where it was did you see where the half actually sat it's completely drying clean and then around the neck here kind of that's where the the waste is but it really looks worse than it actually is I think I weighed again I have one of these and I put about 5 4 or 5 grams in here and it looks crazy it looks like oh my god and I waited before and after and I think my total yield off that 5 grams was like 3 grams of a six-star oil rosin and there was less than half a gram was like 0.3 0.4 23 I think it was really uh just a little bit was on the screen I think it's definitely worth it because when I press hash before and not put it on there it's dirty and it's yet and it has contaminant in it and it tastes like garbage and it looks like garbage and then you kind of press it and unless it's two-star now if it's two-star it'll all stay in the same area on the parchment paper without the screen and all the oil will press out maybe not as pretty as this but it'll be you know you know D level but if you're doing like three or even four star and you decide to do that then a lot of the contaminants are real oily too and they're gonna press out with it and then it's just it's not as good trust me I did not like toxin to begin with content for that situation that stuff is really stable I'm actually gonna cut this piece of paper in half because I don't want to look at all over the place there's lots of ways you can harvest this - the new way I like to do when there's a little bit more I'm good it's just the old way because there's just a little bit of it but I've been taking when all my harvest portion on a piece of parchment and then just dabbing it along and picks it up really well I found again you can roll it see the rolling method really works the stable stuff gets it nice and clean the next one again that second precedent really yield would only do a bigger one I'll press it a second time and it'll be a pretty good yield and then I'll press it a third time and it'll be obvious that it's pretty much all done I don't don't just give up a little that shuddered take a shot for Instagram all right get it off of this thing now stop showering you're all over the foot just be slow it's kind of like oil in that you know you move slow and it's this gets movable go hard fast showers a little place yep well definitely it down press it out so you can check it out so I hope that really explains hash rosin tech and maybe some of you did not know about the pressing screen as a filter now I know that this is the same material they make teacher simply do t-shirt screenings with - I think so I don't think there's any you know you're not you're not going very hot anyway you know two to three fifty two hundred degrees three fifty is the zone I would try to stay in and you're not going to have any issues with that I've used these screens a couple times and then afterwards you can just have a jar and just fill that with 99% or whatever clear and then just put your little put these little things in there Boop and then just pull them out in an hour - and they're pretty you know you can just strain them out and then rinse them off and they're ready to go again huh what do you think of my three star just six star Rossum I think it's killer and I mean I would smoke this on a screen but it'll just go right through it is like seven star really like oil you can't really smoke wheel on a screen that's gonna move around I know it it's really warm in here mom sucka whoa I have the worst focusing problem chair there we go almost [Music] it is very nice regardless there we go is very translucent that's I think that's pretty impressive for for rosin I got a banger for the little Toro my little traveler if you want I can show you hit out of that this time since we're gonna be dabbing straight on the nail anyway I'll see if I can jump backwards people do that this girl [Music] you guys a lot more milk check it out a couple of the other videos on the channel always been goin up some hash talking about it just public it playlists up there too you should check out let that cool off just a sec flower Eisen I mean Astros and that looks so pretty I almost thought it was fire cheers YouTube [Music] [Music] mmm that was delicious yeah the flavor definitely has improved with the lower temps all right well how's about it I hope that that helps somebody out there I hope everybody else enjoyed you know catch you next time", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you check us out at Doug smasher com2 check out all of our

going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is

fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music]

then we're making danca forest Rowdies this episode is sponsored by the wizard puff online head shop you can save money with the code rough house on the tart press rosin press and many other really cool cannabis related products at wizard puff calm now let's get started with the first part of the video which is to make our rosin ship Kennebec for that you want to need rosin chips you're gonna need some butter I use unsalted butter you need an emulsifier such as sunflower or soy liquid lecithin and that is optional the amount of cannabis Ross and chips you need is you kind of Center you need three to four times the amount of rosin chips that you would regular cannabis so for a cup I'm using 66 grams which is a little over two ounces which would equal to a little over 1/2 ounce of regular cannabis okay so let's get started the first step is going to be to decarboxylate and some my previous videos I didn't decarboxylate the cannabis chips but I found out through some testing with my tea check that I do need to decarboxylate it will help so we're going to go ahead and decarboxylate crumble that up in an oven safe dish put some foil on it to keep down the smell and then we're going to put that in the oven to decarboxylate it it takes about the same amount of time as it what if it was on decarboxylated or unpressed cannabis so we're going to do it for 25 minutes 250 degrees Fahrenheit that gives us enough time to clarify our butter now I'm going to do all the steps today to make as good a can of butter as I can so one part of that is to clarify your butter that's and we're moving on the milk solids and so we will have a more pure butter oil that's remaining that butter oil will make it more bioavailable by concentrating the oil instead of having the milk solids still contain in there so it'll also help it be more shelf stable by removing the milk solids which will make it ruin quicker if you left it out on the counter so those the reasons that we clarify herb butter you heat that over medium medium-high heat until it foams and you take that skim and skim the white foam off and then if you get to the point of heat where it starts making the little burnt pieces on the bottom go ahead and cut your heat off you don't want to scorch your butter and if you get it a little brown it's okay it'll have a nice nutty taste but don't burn your butter okay and then after that you should have your cannabis decarboxylated your butter is clarified and we're going to do a new step here that I don't usually do and this is colored emulsifying step so what I'm doing is I'm taking the cannabis and putting in the hopper of a food processor while it's still hot or still warm at least from the oven from the clarification the butter and that's going to help soften up these rosin chips that are compressed and really hard and I've also added in my soy or this is sunflower lecithin which is an emulsifier that's going to help homogenized all these items together so you see I gave you several pulses there with a food processor that's going to grind up those rows and chips and help us extract out that remaining cannabis that's lodged inside of those pressed chips and I've given it about 15-20 seconds total just pulse it a few times there and you can see what what's happened is now those rosin chips that were you know thick and I'll press together have loosened up temperature and both that and the pulsing it have really loosened it and started the infusion process already but we haven't infused it yet so we're still going to use the heat infusion process so I'll put that back into the oven safe dish I've used the same piece of foil and I put it back in the oven 250 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours for infusion alright so we're just about finished with our can of butter here this is some really really dark and dank can of butter because we're using four times the amount of cannabis that we would usually use of course it's going to be a lot darker in color and you can see that really shows through a lot there alright so we're going to now strain out the cannabis and we're using our fine mesh strainer you're just going to strain it through and I'm using the back end of a silicon paddle there just to press and press and let it sit and let the all the oil press through and run through there because you don't want to leave anything in there you're going to lose some and you saw I started with three sticks of butter but I'm going to end up with one cup so I actually always count on losing a third amount of my butter between the clarifying it and all that and what's left in there and then what you can do with the cannabis let's go over put it in your compost and just put that back into the ground where it came from [Music] and now we'll continue on with the dank forest brownies recipe for that you need a half a cup of canned butter we just made a large chocolate brownie mix yes a store-bought mix 2 eggs 3 tablespoons of water 12 ounces of coconut pecan icing and some chopped pecans about a cups of chopped pecans okay the first step is going to be a 10 ml to measure out your butter now if you're using a store-bought mix I am recommending it here go ahead and measure out the amount that it says in your recipe it probably say to use oil vegetable oil just replace that with this butter oil that we made okay you might say 1/3 cup my say 2/3 mine's a half a cup alright so we're going to have that measured out and if you already had your can of butter or frozen or you know hardened up or stored up you'd want to you know put it in some dish of hot water till they got liquefied to measure it out properly ok when our leftover counted butter I'm going to store that back in refrigerator and a hair tie container and there I'm using this supreme triple Chunk brownie mix it's so good and I'm using the large size to make a family pan but I'm not going to make a family pan we're making big thick brownies okay and you're going to use the store or in the box recipes it's a mine called for water eggs and then the oils which I use the butter ok and then just mix it up as per the directions really simple to make brownies you just mix all the ingredients together and just mix it mix until you have a nice creamy consistency just like that everything mixed in together [Music] ok I'm using a 9 by time 9 by 9 pan for this recipe that's what I find to be perfect so if you use that same mix and the same size it should work out like this but otherwise follow the instructions for your recipe as far as cooking it goes ok for mine of baking that at 350 Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes and this is just sort of a pro tip here if you're gonna toast your nuts and I highly recommend it I mean if you're gonna put the nuts on there just toast them do it tastes great and it's a perfect to use the oven that's already on so while your brownies are cooking go ahead and toast your nuts in there to chop and toast them alright but then after your brownies are done you know how to check that by putting the little the toothpick in there when it comes out clean your brownies are done you're gonna go ahead and let that cool completely before you ice it so it it's the hardest part letting that cool and I'm using this Betty Crocker pecan coconut icing because I'm making like sort of like a black forest cake that flavor but with the the dang brownie so that's the dank forest brownies and so just loaded up with that coconut icing just just smear it all over I mean heavier like and a gross amount almost but just just load it up and then those nuts that we toasted earlier are cooled off and so you can press them down into that icing so that they don't fall off and kind of make it less later mess later it's just kind of use your palm a little bit wet your palm and just press them down into that it would be perfect and then you're done you're ready to enjoy these bad boys and these are so delicious you just won't believe how much that sweetness and that big thick icing on top and those toasted nuts adds to it you'll love these also be sure to check out wizard puffs calm they're

back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this

bags into MCT oil cups my name is Adam pepper if you like this video don't forget to subscribe make sure you guys hit that like button and don't be afraid to chew me a comment if you have any questions today we're gonna be learning how to use our old rosin squish bags in our edible and here I have MCT oil medium chain triglycerides these are the fatty acids that bond very well with cannabinoids you're gonna need multiple rosin pucks these are leftover rosin bags from my previous squishes the leftover cannabinoids in these rosin bags are partially d carlock's they do not need much time to achieve a full d carb d carbon the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for roughly 25 minutes try to make sure that you organize the rosin bags at the very bottom of the glass so that when the oil is there it's sitting in within the oil all together you want all the bags at the very bottom you blend the two together the MCT oil and the rosin bags inside the jar and just boil on top of the stove and the temperature doesn't really matter I try to bring it up to a boil but then I bring it down to a slow boil anywhere around 200 degrees is really good temperature for bonding cannabinoids after roughly an hour of this boiling on the stove you got to make sure that there's no pressure built up inside the mason jar and looks like after roughly an hour we do have some pressure we don't want this glass to break open inside this boiling water so I'll remove this take the cap off for a moment relieve any pressure that's in there and then I'll place it back in the water for another two hours I'll do this every half hour to 45 minutes just to make sure that nothing bad happens there are always procedures you need to take to keep yourself safe at home and this is one I recommend once you've allowed your jar to boil for roughly three hours you can remove the jar take the lid off strain it through a filter you can use a coffee filter you could use another rosin bag myself I'm gonna be using a large-sized rosin bag it just happens to fit over the end of the mason jar and then I'll strain drain and then get insane there you have it you have your final product strained and charred and then you've got your capsules measured and ghosts and that's how I make my edibles one of those bad boys does meet all night long", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "swXm_XPodwY": "alright guys so let's make this short and sweet I have six grams of gummy bears inside my peer pressure rosin bag I go over here open up my plate excuse it in there and I'm gonna get this in the center of these plates I can't do it one-handed so it will be very bad start off a little bit of pressure oh sure Jews I don't expect no big downpour like I said this is 6 grams so I'll probably get about one point three grams of return from it somewhere around there 1.2 1.3 man definitely looking good a little more pressure now be careful though because you had too much pressure you will bust the bag or the parchment paper this is really strong parchment paper it's not from the grocery store this is from peer pressure also but you can still only take so much before you rip it wide open alright guys so we're at about the 2 minute mark [Applause] [Applause] so there we have it looking good peace", "5ljRikoZgb0": "uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doo doo butter cannabis goes through a lot of steps to become nice clear distillate like this but you might be surprised by what is actually used to make all of your distillate pins and all your edibles and all your syringes i'm about to tell you how distillate is made right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about wheat distillate is a weed extract but unlike other extracts distillate goes through an extensive process where everything is stripped away from the plant except for one specific cannabinoid if you're new here my name is matt this is the strain show and this is the channel for adults and patients where i teach you the answers to all the questions you've ever had about week if you want to learn all kinds of fun facts about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain now distill it looks awesome but it doesn't have much of a smell or much of a taste the distillation process removes all of the terpenes and leaves you with only one cannabinoid usually thc or cbd this is a glass syringe with a one-to-one ratio of thc and cbd oil this stuff doesn't have any smell at all and when you dab it it looks super duper clear [Music] and it doesn't have much of a taste either you can't really taste it i mean you can taste it but it doesn't really have a flavor and this sucks because most of the medicinal benefits of weed and most of the high you get from weed is from all of the cannabinoids working together as a team in what's called the entourage effect sometimes they will add these terpenes back into the distillate at the end of the process and sometimes weird things are added to distillate like synthetic terpenes or maybe terpenes from another plant like lavender to give it a good taste but one of the biggest uses for distillate is making edibles almost all thc or cbd edibles are made with distillate and that means that none of these edibles are going to have any of those important cannabinoids or terpenes they're going to be just thc or cbd although the finished product of distillate is pure and potent it's usually made from the cheapest weed leftovers available to the extractor since all distillates look about the same at the end of the process you can use low-grade trim leaves like trim from a trimming machine to make distillate and it won't really matter with other types of extracts low-grade weed will make low-grade hash but not with distillate that's why some people say from trash to hash when talking about distillate the first step of making distillate is getting what's called a crude extraction oil uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doodoo butter this nasty crude oil is usually extracted with bho like most other concentrates but since we started off with such a low grade product this is what we ended up with but this crude oil has a lot of impurities that we're gonna have to remove before we can begin to separate this oil down into its specific cannabinoids and we're gonna do that in the next step which is called winterization in this step the crude oil is mixed with ethanol and that mixture is then placed in a very cold freezer for 24 to 48 hours while this mix is in the freezer all the impurities like chlorophyll plant waxes fats and lipids they all stick together and sink to the bottom of the container after a day or two of being in the freezer all the impurities are filtered out and the ethanol is evaporated with something like this rotary evaporator so now it looks good but it's not exactly very potent yet all cannabinoids that are in their acid form even thc have to be decarboxylated before they will interact with your body the way you want them to in the third step the oil is heated to 220 degrees fahrenheit and this removes the carboxylic acid group and that converts your thc a into thc now this stuff will get you high but it's not finished yet the last step of the process is the actual distillation process itself all of the different cannabinoids in the oil have different boiling points and different molecular weights so in this last step the extractors use vacuum pressure and heat in very precise amounts to evaporate off exactly what cannabinoids they're going after and at the end of the process sometimes they'll add terpenes back into the distillate sometimes they have the terpenes from the same weed they made the distillate from sometimes they add terpenes from different weeds sometimes they add terpenes from different plants and sometimes they add synthetic terpenes so if your distillate is flavored like a great popsicle you can probably bet there's some synthetic terpenes in there now that i know about it i'm ready to dab it so i'm about to go right here or if you just want to learn some more fun facts about weed i got those videos right here and yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got them nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange show it's like going to weed college", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories much more

impressed this candy glue is fired by Barry oh I got everything set up I got some notes for y'all so let me go ahead read my notes why you guys are focusing in on this this beautiful flower here there you go alright sorry boys it's very special high THC cannabis strains which is a 60% of sativa it was bred from s1 phenotype of guerrilla glue number four time skittles from the green pirate genetics which cross with fit their own Girl Scout cookies so the language the ditional guys have you didn't get it there's a guerrilla gluto before skittles x Girl Scout cookies the feelings are happy uplift at your floor and creative focused effects at health or the chronic pain stress depression anxiety like a vintage a fatigue I let's see these numbers see these numbers here probably gonna be small that's not the numbers there's an operator style right now as you see I pay $45 for his eight my very okay nickyloo sativa flower all right let's see t8 CAS at 27 percent THC s at 0.10 CB da 0 CB d 0 CB g 0 and I see her she began 0:13 2.47 beta-carboline 0.99 I'll be healing 0.37 and I'm a name 0.36 okay you gotta see I'm gonna turn this thing on let's take it set at 200 210 degrees I'm gonna do see you boy tip time what up guys not too bad right little buddy there little bloody bag still got the thing on you know I'm feeling okay I probably sound different because there's these things shoved up my nose to keep everything where it's supposed to be but yeah so I'm feeling okay you guys see it looks like I'm going to bag it up and get ready oh I looked at the the menu and the dispensary where I go to and they got Cresco boys so look out Cresco I do have two other videos where i pre record it which I'm going to upload further than a week I don't I think this is gonna be like maybe my only video I make during recovery time maybe two I don't know but anyway yeah let's get back to present I'll be back pressing this nice flower here I'll be back once she's bagged up and ready to press let's do it boys were back I took up one little last bite to smoke further for the room to review I smoked and smoked the oil do [ __ ] about it I can't bring it up somehow get enough down she's up Timmy take 210 degrees might up cutting a bag a little too small I think I got it yeah CBRE great dish Alexa said it Alexa said attire for three minutes what I'm doing now is just some submission um slowly with the pressure clamp down bear with me a second oh my god she's already starting if you guys can't see that let's go let's go get it for daddy as I'm talking about candy glue my Vireo i rehydrated with the rawhide Gaston I did that for maybe eight hours eight to 12 hours I let it sit for a day and yeah now we press it so Alexa how much time is left one man 20 seconds left boys see anything right sighs what little bit something on the side yeah let's see how much this but uh I took off here so did take off a little but when I do to review is smoking this and that yes so zero

shot that's definitely gonna work - big time I was done she's still moving a little bit it likes to stop he likes to stop as long as he likes saw jesus [ __ ] christ he liked to stop okay he LexA stop yeah okay dear all right let's pop this joke if she was popping it huh nice beautiful of course I'm definitely gonna do a second press on this bottle be buckle so I got the second one in there I just pushed it pushed it down as you can see it looks like it's already signed do something nice thing something I first started recording but right yeah let's check it out and see what we got I gotta reach them in their eyes all right well once I get it all collected up nice buttery looking [ __ ] right there yeah and once I get it all collected up in the second one Preston collect it you guys could see it I know I can yeah stay tuned I'll be back once I get it collected up I'll show you the end result there you have it the first press all right and the second press I pulled that off for the [ __ ] bag here look like some buttery type stuff so say yeah I'm going to snatch that off with the dad tool but yeah see that's very kind of looking shattered it's super good I can't wait to let

[Music]", "P5b05nHaeDU": "hey everyone Rober here and in this video I will be showing you how to make cannabis infused coconut oil so first off let me cover the items that you will need you will need a pot metal spoon coconut will bubble bag or cheesecloth metal tray glass bowl and a cannabis product optionally you can have a candy thermometer as well I am going to be using refined coconut oil and this is 14 fluid ounces which is just under 2 cups refined coconut oil has less of a coconut taste than unrefined coconut oil coconut oil is a healthier alternative than butter for cannabis occasions and this is easy to infuse as well I'm going to be infusing hash into my coconut oil and I am aiming for 6,000 milligrams per 14 ounces or about 2 cups to calculate at 6,000 milligrams I'm going to approximate massages 30 percent THC or 300 milligrams per gram that means to reach 6,000 milligrams I will need to weigh out 20 grams of hash for this infusion [Music] once you have calculated your dosage and weed out the product spread out on a metal tray and put it into the oven at 210 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes to D carve the cannabis you after 45 minutes removed or decarboxylated cannabis product and you are ready to begin your infusion the first thing you'll need to do is scoop the coconut oil out of the jar and into the pot you will need to keep the heat on low while the coconut oil melts down and throughout the infusion you can also stick the coconut oil in a microwave for two minutes and pour the coconut oil out if you are using a candy thermometer aim for 160 degrees Fahrenheit give or take 20 degrees once the coconut oil has melted go ahead and add your decarboxylated cannabis product and stir it in [Music] [Music] [Music] every 10 or 15 minutes for the next two hours you should stir the cannabis coconut oil to complete the infusion having the cannabis product directly in your coconut oil allows for more even extraction from the product than if it was wrapped in cheesecloth or similar product after two hours relief or coconut oil from the stove and pour it through a cheesecloth or bubble bag this will separate the cannabis product from your coconut oil that's all there is to do to infuse your coconut oil of cannabis if you want to solidify the coconut oil simply stick it into the fridge and it will begin to harden coconut oil can be used in a ton of recipes and can also be used to cover popcorn or even spread on toast I hope everyone enjoyed this video and learned something new and I will see you all next time [Music] [Music]", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "Df7s8E64t2U": "yo what up YouTube alright guys this video is gonna be what you can do with all your rosin chips and your bags with your rosin that you press with your hash or whatever you're pressing and your rosin press saving guys you can still use them as you can see I got them sitting in some coconut oil and there's just the bag because everything's in there guys even the rosin chips that I don't have in baggies everything's all in there crushed the way I strain that out is you can use a cheesecloth or you can use an old t-shirt and there's let it cool down to about one just till you want it to be warm when you sift this out I just barely put this in I should have probably shot it before I cook and put everything in but what I did is I got some coconut oil all natural and I used about maybe about 1 cup of oil and you see it sits in there right now and what it's doing is it's it heating up and it's not only is it decarboxylate in it but it's also extracting all the oil from inside of the chips and you can come through and break them up I usually leave it all about good for three to four hours and then I'll come through and I'll just kind of poke at it to make sure I get all the good oils out and then what you're left with is that oil here and it's gonna turn into a nice golden brown or a nice gold color and you can put it back in your container and save it and use it to cook with it and that's just what I'm gonna do with it I'm gonna make some Christmas cookies you can also use rosin you can use wax just take our decarboxylated and you can add it to your cookie like I said there's not a lot of stuff in there but there is some sediment stuff and I'm also doing cleaning it out after after it and after it's finished cooking very easy process guys you can just put it in a crock pot put it on low and let it sit there you can leave it overnight or you can do it four to six hours I usually do about 4 to 6 hours sometimes I'd leave it overnight just depends on how much I'm doing the longer you leave it the more it's going to extract in the dark a little part of become but I used to do about four hours and that's plenty enough for me but you can do that huh as long as you want and like I said this is the coconut oil that I use very cheap very inexpensive and I used about a cup", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "KOtf_C6MZOE": "yo yo yo yo just about to kick it off how's everyone doing tonight today whatever it is where you're at you're

gonna dab for every like so that shit's going up guys are [ __ ] I guess I could get this out of the shot right the artist formerly known as do Paul LaGrone Duvall homegrown 7/10 everyone goes subscribe to his second backup channel my videos are getting better karma pop is saying my videos are getting better thank you so much it's fun making them say I definitely enjoy that [ __ ] probably hungry huh yes thank you so much I appreciate that a lot did you bring me your ball oh my god you're so smart let me feed you done we're smashing it and indeed smashing it it's you smashing it all right doggie is bad way back yeah he'll jump on me eventually cuz it kind of freaks out when I talk to the camera for long at a time I noticed some the second lives are the first live stream also happen Andy you're heading out much love if you don't know what I'm dabbing now some sappy live resin I'll probably have a video on it eventually but it's uh it's called dayglo it's a local growers own but turned into the librarian you don't know the difference between live rosin and hash rosin I'll try to explain it explain it so with ash rosin somebody that knows their [ __ ] uh probably okay basically passed rosin is made from taking fresh bud like a large amount of it and depending on the way you make it you could it's two different way so I'll explain the the water hash way so you can make hash rosin by agitating a bunch of weed with water and shaking it up and straining it into bags so like the trichomes fall off into the bottom of each bag you scrape that let it dry out and then you take that product and you smash it on the rosin presses something like what I have and that's how you make hash doesn't like this [ __ ] it's all super pure solvent Lissa doesn't take any chemicals like most wax like has butane co2 or propane in it to extract it but any type of rosin is solving this no chemicals no [ __ ] other than heat and pressure water but then with life rosin slightly different hash rosin me made with the hash of the weed this is made from fresh fresh buds they're probably super fresh right off the plant frozen and then thrown in a nut Smasher like that it depends the type of weed it varies I've press stuff at the same exact temperatures and you can get many different variations of colors like super dark putty or [ __ ] you could get light color like super shatter II stuff she's still here yeah yeah it's cool didn't like good types of weed and being able to press it and figure out the types of consistencies because some weed doesn't press good at all another strength and steel [ __ ] get like the best best looking [ __ ] lighting color claiming this stuff is so shattering though that's sort of saying that hash are not hash causing any type of rasa specifically rosin from pressing nugs neither can have crazy different textures and stuff this one's super shattering it's been out of the fridge for weeks and it's still okay had to get the tool hot to get it off with the did it I did it a dad time do balls about to pass out Duvall one more DAP time and you could you have my blessing to fall asleep angel say dad time one move over one dad time yes captain sleep tight my friend just might be my last stab out of this pretty toasty hour-and-a-half is what I was probably gonna do in a song sick oh those real taste holy [ __ ] b-ball good night man thank you so much okay [ __ ] okay what's the dog's name his name is Benji Benji he's wild he's a wild pitbull candy yeah he's a lover days freaking lover probably does is lick you [ __ ] three people you have to come back to say peace everybody yeah go that one one more deck ten lights thank you everyone for coming through so tasty Tropicana chop yes see what I said it's a bag you throw [ __ ] Oh oh [ __ ] the word the 7-letter word dab time I so harmless just you just say it dab time and Duval does it but that was just unnecessary oh yeah I'm definitely gonna go die in peace guys it's a good good one I'm guessing I've Andy caramel and Duval possibly I'll have four people [ __ ] if I get another like again but if not I'm gonna say peace have time this is an easy thing to say that if you can't tell cry and I also threw up a bit a lot of it [ __ ] that was amazing I'm gonna finish my crack which is an ice cream right now hmm holy [ __ ] I was heavy get down good I'm all right oh yeah I'm definitely all right I'm just [ __ ] up stop it dude what's your problem all right guys what I'm gonna sleep peacefully and died a little bit inside I'm gonna dream so great if anyone's in the Pueblo area webelo Colorado the bruja Brewfest this Saturday shits going down starts at six o'clock at the el pueblo museum so if you're over 21 you pay a bit and you get in you could taste test all types of [ __ ] crafters hard ciders anything you want just go walk around taste test your some live music my band will be playing from 6 to 9 hard time so Mountain time or whatever so if anyone is in malaria difficult check it out if not I'll probably be live-streaming on my channel so tune in Saturday for that [ __ ] and I'll see you off for the next step load now I will awkwardly I'm trying to figure out in this", "9C2D6rp64Mw": "[Music] hey what's up guys we've got a really cool video for you today we're going to be making rosin infused gummies [Music] the recipe is simple all you'll need is a box of jello mct oil agave or corn syrup sunflower lecithin citric acid and gelatin first things first grab an eighth of some balm weed and go ahead and pack your bag bottle tech style we are going to be smashing on the nug smasher x so we're using nug smasher x 120 micron bags the x is a dream to operate one button extractions it doesn't get any easier than this [Music] [Music] [Music] we collected our rosin and we yielded a little less than a gram next we're going to heat our x-plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit grab your d-carb capsule and throw your rosin in the rosin pot close up the d-carb capsule and put it between the plates for 20 minutes so we can activate our thc [Music] once our 20 minutes is up be very careful when releasing the plates a ton of pressure is built up in our decarb capsule proceed with caution when removing a decarb capsule from between the plates [Music] now that our rosin is ready to infuse we are going to add 10 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker [Music] add low heat to help the rosin infuse with the oil [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that our mct oil is infused we're going to add a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin and we're going to stir it until it fully dissolves into our mct oil [Music] once our oil is ready we'll set it aside so we can start making our gummies [Music] first things first we're going to add 1 3 cup of water to our beaker next let's add a quarter cup of agave to our water you can use corn syrup if you like we chose to use agave instead go ahead and turn on your magnetic stirrer next we're going to add a half packet of jello you can pick any flavor you like we decided to go with lemon [Music] add one packet of knox gelatin to our mix next we are going to add a quarter teaspoon of citric acid [Music] let the mixture stir for five minutes on low heat so that the gelatin can bloom and all of the mixture looks consistent and doesn't have any clumps [Music] and for the final step we save the best ingredient for last we're going to add our mct oil and let that infuse with our gummy mixture grab your gummy molds and spray them with cooking oil using a dropper carefully fill all your molds let them sit out for about 30 minutes and then place them in the fridge for another 30 minutes [Music] let your gummies aerate for 24 to 48 hours to achieve maximum gumminess this will also help with storage bon appetit your weed infused gummies are ready to eat thanks for watching and don't forget to keep calm and smash on nug smasher rosin made simple [Applause] [Music] you", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "mEGRx0b7y7M": "you know what's up ask all right man for those of you out there that press rosin you know Ross and chips are you guys don't throw these things away they're still valuable you can make edibles out of them and still extract oils from these blossom ships here I've been saving for a few months I'm about or a pound here it's just a few grams under 400 4 ounces I removed as much as I could from the bags but it's not necessary I just showed you the same people do it in the bag some people just squish the buds as I've done out some of these but I also pressed hash and you can still still see there's a lot of hash on these bags so when you go to cook it and you have a double boiler or your or your whatever you want to do it if you have a butter machine you can just throw everything in there I wouldn't recommend the bags in your burning machine but if you're just gonna steep it and like a crock pot or double boiler I'll do another video on how I actually make the butter but save your chips guys they're valuable they're still a lot of THC in these and yeah like I said I've done everything this is a hash chip right here and there's still quite a bit of rosin still left in there this bag here is still sticky I'm gonna go ahead and throw it in the in the crock pot as well and boil everything down and I'm gonna separate everything afterwards anyways it's gonna be sifted we're going to be left with this pure THC and the butter and you can use that butter to cook with you can put it on your toast you can you can throw it in your brownies or you can actually make THC capsules as well two things you can do with your rods or chips you just gotta take it down to the oil form again and extract everything out of the cannabis that's left in there and there's still quite a bit left in there guys this rosin bag here is sticky as still and there's a lot of oil still you guys so going through your chips away save them the more the more chips you have the better and like I said about four ounces of rose and chips and a hash bags just a multitude of different strings and but it doesn't matter it's all gonna go into edibles and if they're in bags like this and I squish different ways where the down like the bottleneck style and when it's hard to take the bags apart from this point you can just cut it up into pieces boylee down with your butter and it'll be just fine it's okay to cook the bags those are food grade safe bags anyways when you buy them their food great so it's okay to boil these down and they'll be perfectly fried and once everything is broken down into a nice butter then you can go ahead and use that butter for many different things to cook with you can make edibles you can do whatever you want whether you're doing you can do with coconut oil you can do with butter just regular butter or you can actually just use coconut oil and cook it down into into you can use alcohol as well and it'll break it down and boil it down into like Rick Simpson oil type and you can use that like a hash oil and make capsules and you can do that with it and just swallow on me personally I'm gonna make edibles this run water so I can make brownies and some goodies and yeah that's what I'm gonna do with the guys you can use coconut oil or you can use any kind of oil canola oil or olive oil you can use I'm gonna use butter this round but I'll make that video separate from what I'm doing now I'm just so many guys which you can do with your eyes and chips and it's worth it and do", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show

dexter's laboratory i'm led fromage that's uh yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "THzn8apDpKs": "ok everybody we're back now you saw the last two videos you got her pucks we've got a whole bunch of them here there's probably 40 different strains here this is heat safe because it's used for canning a regular mason jar this is what I use I use liquid coconut oil because this is the most bioavailable of the coconut oils and it works really really well for making edibles so take it there is 16 ounces in here that's 2 cups I'm going to use so oil now we got to do put the lid on give it a nice little agitation here make sure everything gets covered in the oil and we're gonna stir this occasionally during the process but now this has to go in the oven this is going to go in at 240 degrees for two and a half hours okay when we're done we're gonna strain out all this material what we're gonna have is a highly infused oil that we are then going to add to lots lots of gelatin flavored unflavored and that's how we make our edibles just go right into to a form usually see they're gonna be the usual halves my favorite are these I like these gumdrop ice cube trays work really well they got the little little squishing on the bottom to get these out of there it works really well so this is what we're going to use everything else is probably going to go into a bulk container that I can just portion out in a later time but this is going to make a bunch jealous so follow me we're going to take this in here gonna put it in the oven it's already preheated to 240 just in case there's any kind of pressure we're off so we're going to come back in two and a half hours when this is done and strain the material out when you take it over here and show you how I do my enemies everybody's got their own technique this just happens to be mine done by many many requests to see how I do the edibles that I made so please join me in a couple of hours thanks for joining me on this first part of the two-part video we'll see you soon", "l3ebdlDK-KM": "[Music] hi it's mad at roughout studios welcome to canavezes today we're gonna be learning how to make rosin chip counter butter or coconut oil in order to make Roz and Chef Canada better of course schooner nice and Roz and chips you're also going to need some clarified butter coconut oil or olive oil and you need some water which is optional you can use the herbal infusion machine which we're using today you can also use a double boiler setup or an oven I'll show you that method as well if you do want to check out the herbal infusion calm please save $30 with the code ruffhouse and thanks to the herbal infuser comm for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to press your Asin and to keep the chips if you're wondering about rose and chips are they're the chips that are left over after you've used the rosin press to press out the rosin or the wax from the cannabis you can see I've got a handful of chips here it's about announces and now it's worth of cannabis that I press to get this here but you can use whatever ratio or whatever amount that you have or want the more chips you use and the less oil the more potent the next step after you've collected your chips together is to combine the chips and the oil or butter that you're using if you're using the herbal infuser machine you can just drop the chips right into the bucket or into the hopper there's no need to do any kind of breaking or anything like that because the blade on the Herbalife user is going to do that more than adequately but if you're not using the herbal infuser you're going to go ahead and break that the cannabis you don't need to grind it but you just want to break it up by hand until they're little pieces like you see there it's really easy to do that and you want to do that if you're using a double boiler as well and if you're using the oven method but like I said not if you're using the herbal infuser and now you're going to add in the oil and the ratio that you use is up to you if you use less oil and more chips you're going to get a much stronger oil but if you want like a cooking oil that you can use everyday you can use a large amount of oil and so for about an ounce worth of pressed cannabis I'm using the about 2 cups of oil but you can see that the oil that I have didn't quite meet the fill line and the Herbalife infuser machine and that's fine with our butter or oil you can go ahead and use water to fill that that little space in there so I'm adding in about a half a cup of water and then I had about almost two cups of oil in there and that we're using that water to get it to the minimum fill line and now the next step is going to be to infuse the cannabis into the butter or oil you do this using heat and with the herbal infuser machine you don't need to worry about that I used the mighty fast to cycle which is an hour and a half and it's going to be plenty hot enough to infuse that oil but if you're using the oven or a double boiler you set up over a double boiler and keep the water boiling for an hour and a half but if you're using an oven you can put it in the oven for about an hour and a half or two hours at 250 degrees Fahrenheit and after it's infused for about an hour and a half either way that you've done it you're going to be able to strain out the cannabis from the oil now here I am straining out the oil that I made in the oven and this is actually a really strong oil I used about over a quarter ounces worth of pressed cannabis and then a very very small amount of oil that you can see there it's just about a quarter cup of oil or less so I've got a really strong oil there that would be great for putting into capsules and just swallowing and taking like a pill and now for my cooking oil that I used about two cups of oil and about an ounce of pressed cannabis you'll see that it's a lot different color and a lot different consistency and it's gone through the herbal infuse or for its hour-and-a-half cycle and it's finished and you can see that the blades really pulverize to those rosin chips into a it's a very gelatinous murky mulch it was kind of disgusting actually but the oil that comes through the bottom is really nice and you don't want to press that through there because if you press that it's polarized so much it will come through the strainer so just let it run through it and drain out but you're not finished there because we have that water in the oil so what I've done is I've put that in the refrigerator or the freezer for just a few minutes and let it solidify and we're going to be able to easily separate the butter oil from the water as I said before you wouldn't want to use olive oil for this but because it would be too hard the olive oil won't really solidify so that you can separate it easily but with the coconut oil or the butter it'll be fine and two ways to resep rate the water is to one is to poke a hole and turn it over let it drain out or if you've got a bowl that will have a little bit of a tapered side you can just kind of tilt it out and the oil will stay solid and you can take that really murky looking water it's got chlorophyll and a lot of other inactive ingredients it's just going to help clean up the taste of your butter as well and I tested this oil just cuz I was curious so what kind of potency what I get I would get I got seventy two point six milligrams of THC per tablespoon which is a pretty decent butter which is really nice after you think you've got a cannabis that's no good anymore to be able to make a really good cannabutter a can of oil out of it is a really nice way to get the very most out of your cannabis so I hope you enjoyed this method of making rosin chip cannabutter if you did hit that like button for me also subscribe to

how's it going everybody just want to show you this real quick this is uh my next little uh invention not an invention but in the experiment we'll see what i got here is uh my buddy a good friend there dave west virginia davey sent me some coconut oil this stuff here the plastic anyways i got all these things all right with all my rosin chips from left over from my press i save them up and as you can see i've got a good stock of them right now two big bags full of them there's roughly 14 grams of marijuana in each one of these so i probably got over over a couple pounds there worth of pressing uh what i'm gonna do is i went out and i bought some more coconut oil a couple more jugs of it and i'm gonna put the oil in my slow cooker and i'm going to put in however many of these will go in it you know being overfilled and i'm going to infuse the coconut oil with my rods and chips i watched the video where they did this and you know they only put in like not even maybe 10 of these things a couple more maybe and their tests came back at over 3 500 milligrams of thc in the oil which is pretty potent so um this one here i put a couple in there just to check it out and you can see the amber oil that was clear oil before you can see the amber color in it up against the light there so that is all rosin oil whatever you want to call it medicine anyways long story short once it's all infused in my oil i'm going to take these babies here and somebody gave actually dave it was my buddy dave he gave me the idea i'm gonna take a piece of 2x4 and a drill bit that fits it and put it in my drill press blast out a whole bunch of holes that way i can put the bottom half of these in the holes fill them all up and then put the caps on instead of the last way i did it one at a time you know what a pain in the butt that was so that's what i'm going to be doing with all these babies there's a there's probably a couple of freaking pounds right there easily i could count eight ounces just in the first half so anyways that's that people that's what i'm going to be doing next and i'll give you a quick look here i took some more clones and that bottle flower i don't know what's going on with that thing whatever and one of my clones there i took it out of the corner the other one i don't know those are the first ones i took it had roots so if it goes it goes if not whatever not worried about it a little puny thing anyways but there's this put the first net on first scrugg and that's gone on it's so a lot of filling out to do i'm gonna give it about a week left and veg okay and then i'm gonna flip her in the flour it'll fill out once you put her in the flour they stretch and like i said it's got about another week roughly about a week another week left and it's gonna be close to two months of veg time so that'll be good for that there we go that one is in i got another one so that once these things are you know get up here a bit more a couple feet off i can put a another one across to support the buds hopefully they need it hopefully it goes like that anyway so there you go that's that people i just want to show you what i'm up to that's what i'm doing don't throw away your rosin chips if you're into making it i'm sure people that have been doing it for a while know about it but there is a lot of stuff left in these things tons of oil left on these and i only do two presses a lot of people do three people i know anyways they'll do three presses on it so there you go i should get a good little number back like i said look at this one there's only four pucks in there right now and i got you know an oil turned amber so but you gotta infuse it decarboxylate it with the infusion so that's that i'll let you know how it turns out and uh we'll go from there people all right you all have yourselves a great day like subscribe comment do what you got to do have a great day be safe out there peace out", "efC57bwzEg4": "hey everybody um i'm gonna be reviewing these dialed in gummies from leafa i went to their dispensary today and they've got the most [ __ ] awesome dispensary man um i actually got a gram of this green dot labs uh black cherry og butter from them and uh it was only only uh 18 too man in green dot it usually goes um more along the lines of uh 30 40 dollar grams but uh they have green dot for really cheap so if you got a medical card you can get it for for 18 plus tax a gram it's black cherry og and it does have a black cherry smell to it man i can't wait to dab some of this stuff in a little bit um let's review these doubting gummies and i'll be honest with you guys i went ahead and opened them to check them out i haven't eaten one yet uh but down here if you'll notice uh i don't know if you can see that but uh the um the thc they put in here is cannabis risin extracted from ice water hash so i mean this is a saliva edible um i just ate a [ __ ] brownie like an hour ago i don't know if y'all saw my video from that but uh i'm already starting to feel pretty [ __ ] high and you know me i got a i got a pretty high tolerance to edibles sometimes they don't even really get me that high i think i'm uh lacking this uh compound in my liver that they say like 10 of the population has that edibles they just don't do you like they do everybody else like me i get a really heavy body high but people talk about like [ __ ] tripping almost off the edibles like my my cousin for example man he gets [ __ ] so high off of just one of those 50 milligrams man he if he ate a couple hundred milligrams he'd probably be hallucinating uh z you know you know you uh uh [ __ ] i don't know man i'm just mumbling i'm a little [ __ ] up already you guys gotta excuse me but i think these are going to be really [ __ ] good and you know what else is kind of cool i picked up they have the stickers for them they have these just for free laying out and it's actually the sticker they put on here they had those at the dispensary um now what i thought's really cool about these they make an actual numbered batch uh these medical uh batch number and then these are batch seven and it actually has the strain up here of papaya cake and puntain pie and they only make 420 of this particular strain and it looks like i got number 158 of 420 so you see that it's kind of cool it lets you know it's a real small batch operation um probably a lot of care goes into these gummies now it's a really cool little tin way you open this is you just twist your palms in opposite directions and it screws right up i thought these gummies were were pretty cool looking right here where they got them placed in which one should we try first let's go with the green one first what do you guys think got a nice green one right here thc label it's 50 milligrams you have a pretty happy good gummy only thing i like is it got a lot of sugar in it i make sure back your teeth hurt a little bit there's mmm and it's got the hashy after flavor i love that man if you don't [ __ ] want to know you're eating weed go get some [ __ ] wanna gummies they taste like [ __ ] sour gummies you buy at the gas station but if you want to know you're eating a little something have a little bit of a cannabis flavor because i mean he doesn't [ __ ] like the hashy flavor of cannabis is great [ __ ] buy these gummies these are the hashiest gummies i've had so far man that's pretty good um gosh i have an interview today shall i do one more why not for the video ma'am 100 mil or 50 milligrams more gummy these are superior um other might as well give you a little review on this if you're into nicotine salts the smok uh it's the new smart nord it's [ __ ] great mod i bought it the other day for 50 bucks that's wonderful a lot better uh than these [ __ ] little things i've been smoking on these literally all summer man and all through october and i just couldn't do it anymore i had to [ __ ] uh had to buy me a new mod but hey thanks guys peace out um got an interview this afternoon so i gotta go wish me luck on that and um [ __ ] buy these gummies if you're in the colorado area and have a medical card because these a plus taste and you can tell there's weed in them later guys", "Yw_4YEp3EpI": "hey what's up everybody uh i'm pretty [ __ ] excited tonight because i just got back from my local medical dispensary and they just got the [ __ ] dialed in gummies in i don't have to drive across town to [ __ ] lakewood when i want to procure a 500 milligram can of dialed in gummies reminds me of a dip can kind of but um dude these are right here um [ __ ] now i've done a video on these already um this is a new batch this would be batch number 12. they always label their batch and up to a certain number and i guess they start over or some [ __ ] but what's really cool is man they're small batches each batch is individually labeled or individually numbered by pin by hand so in uh this particular they use the wedding cake uh strain of bud which is a really [ __ ] good strain uh one of my personal favorites it's a heavy indica um and this is they only made 465 of these and this is can 359 out of 465. so this batch right here they literally got it got it numbered right there by pen you can see right under the 12 359 of 465 and that's just so [ __ ] cool man i mean these are uh they're a little bit more expensive than like your your average incredibles 1000 milligram pack you know you pay about 45 for that you're gonna pay about 42 for this um and it's only 500 milligrams but dude these gummies are so good and they're made they're made with this lit they're not made with co2 oil they're made with water hash or here it says terpene rich full spectrum rosin but um what it actually is it's uh rosin extracted from ice water hash so it's beautiful man these gummies are are uh they only use water ice heat and pressure to make these bad boys or to at least to extract the uh chemical uh or the uh thc for these bad boys so good all natural edible um because if it ain't just made with can of butter and if it's not something like this i guarantee it's been extracted with at least co2 if not ethanol if not butane which i'm okay with i'm fine with it man i'll smoke many things extracted with it with the good old butane um i just think it's nice to have a clean product like this and look how cool that is up there what does it say reefer madness dispensary and you see on my other uh on my other dialed ins they just have the [ __ ] name of the dispensary the leafa leafa um damn this was number 12 of uh a 227 or 277. i got an early one on that one it's a cans empty i can't throw these [ __ ] cans away man i'm a [ __ ] hoarder um so let's open this thing up right here man check it out now i'm i like to keep my labels intact as much as i can so i usually use this little method right here when it comes to open and [ __ ] like this i guess i open it like you would a dip can with these little stickers on the side and as you can see on there as you can see as well now that i cut it but it says rosin extracted with ice water ash total thc 500 milligrams per serving 50 milligrams and uh somebody told me some rapper likes these [ __ ] things i don't really like any rap music that was made after 2003 i think a little boosie or some [ __ ] i know he's an older rapper but he was he's kind of kind of past my time because i'm more into the golden era rap the 90s bone thugs and harmony wu-tang clan biggie pock [ __ ] uh [ __ ] uh junior mafia [ __ ] the doc um snoop i mean [ __ ] even eminem man dude i loved eminem he was like my last favorite favorite rapper uh was eminem so oh yeah at first i was going to tell you guys uh these the flavors on these are passion fruit elderberry watermelon interesting fact um about elderberry very very poisonous berry um if it's not processed right or if it's not cooked right there's something uh something about elderberry very very poisonous um but uh you can get the you can get the essence from it or some [ __ ] like that look it up but uh it is interesting fact anyway these are some beautiful looking gummies they stick and we'll pull one out i like to start with the purple power let's start a little little purple power or you know it that's not even purple that's like a it's like kind of a blue which one i think this is ah this is probably the poisonous elderberry let's try it hmm of course i gotta crack 100 milligram keep going go with these gummies that was delicious um barry i'm not really no i've had that before but i believe that was the elderberry it's good ah [ __ ] yeah keep going i don't drink much alcohol because of certain medications i'm on so and kind of like the keef co it takes one it takes place alcohol medical card milligram cans if you don't have a medical card unfortunately the sodas only come in 10 milligram cans which is [ __ ] 10 milligrams they ain't get nobody high well maybe a few people who are really uh really low tolerance man or some people get high five 10 milligrams that'd be lovely if i could do that let's eat another gummy let's go with the uh agent orange this time mr orange um these are 50 milligrams a piece by the way so this makes 100 milligrams of gummy that i've eaten and what flavor would this probably be i'm taking it as the passion fruit because it's probably not the watermelon i doubt it's the elderberry it's orange so passion fruit very very well made very good that's 100 milligrams so far and i already ate i have one of these bad boys oh let's do another 100 um another elderberry and this last one of these i might eat because i want to save them they're sick because they're so [ __ ] good all right i'm probably gonna stock up you know what um that was delicious oh man that was delicious dialed in gummies baby um i get more savvy at the youtube because i wanted this to be in the picture of uh you know when you pull up when you scroll down i want you to be able to see a doubting gummies click baby click on it but i'm not so tech savvy guys i'm [ __ ] 34 years old um that could be a little bit more tech savvy but i'm not i didn't get a smartphone until like 2016 because i was uh homeless before that chilling down to wilmington you know what let's take one of these um sorry about that glare wanna sour gummy strawberry lemonade and uh yeah man let's turn that glare off that's a little better wanna sour gummy strawberry lemonade cbd thc one-to-ones let's get one of these real quick uh i only got one left in there yeah let me show you five people what this looks like it itself is a little thc logo that's the whole gummy is and it's strawberry lemonade flavor it's the medical grade it has 20 milligrams of cbd and 20 milligrams of thc per gummy 200 and 200 for the pack and i like the waters because they they i'm pretty sure they use co2 oil um or distillate um but uh the terpenes they had they had some terpenes in here um you know cannabis terpenes meister and whatnot um minus sour gummies always a good choice i'm a fan of the one to one cbd at thc it's important to get a little cbd in your system helps you sleep better helps your body handle the thc a little bit better [Music] it's a good thing it's a good thing so um because i've gotten a few requests i am going to upload this video and then immediately do a video on green dot silver label full spectrum extract trop santo which i picked up tonight 71.30 thc and look at that beautiful sauce right there you know let's turn this [ __ ] light off again let's see well you can't really see it that well there either but it's beautiful and i'm gonna make a video on that um i know one of my subscribers had asked for me to do a silver label video i did do one but um i want to do one on this brand new batch because i've even tried it yet so um cool i'm gonna upload this video then do one on the silver label peace out guys thank you for supporting thank you for watching love y'all", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video

we're gonna do something super special it's the holiday season we're doing Rasen infused snowball cookies we have our rosin right here it's about a gram we just pressed this we pressed about 4.1 grams of a motorbreath and we got about 1.1 grams back that's super high yield we did the math about 27% we just pressed it using the next Smasher XP the XP is great because of the pressure gauge we did this at about 700 725 material pressure that's pretty light for doing flour but we wanted to keep it light to get that really clean looking product back we did about 205 206 degrees you know not too hot not too cold and we left in about 200 seconds that's a you know longer time than usual but because of that lower pressure you can add a little bit more time get that good yield back and that clean results so we're really excited to deke are with the mini today this is our number one selling product everybody has a mini right now and we just came out with an expansion mini D carb this thing makes activating your rosin super easy so get yours now just came out we're gonna throw our rods and in that mini D carb we're gonna put in the Nook Smasher mini 250 degrees 25 minutes we're gonna do that and then we'll get started making those snowball cookies what's up everybody this is chef Eric here at the crown and kitchenware today for our holiday recipe we're going to be making snowball cookies absolutely my most favorite cookie of all time there are sometimes called Mexican wedding cookies but they're basically buttery and delicious shortbread cookies that are covered in powdered sugar and we're gonna make ours even more delicious today by adding in the fabulous motorbreath rose and then we have d carving right over there we have about eight hundred and twenty-five milligrams of THC be carving over there and the batch we're making today's 418 cookies so you're going to end up with about 46 milligrams of THC per cookie give or take some see how it goes when you make this recipe just make sure that your total amount of rosin is divided by 18 so you can get your portions just about right because you don't want to be givin people too much or too little I think that the 825 we're gonna have is gonna be just perfect cuz I know I'm gonna be eaten probably the whole batch so if you are ready I'm ready I'm super excited let's get to cookin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everybody welcome back I for one I'm super excited to try these cookies I wasn't lying when I said these were my favorites so just a word again about dosage remember there was about eight hundred and twenty five milligrams in that entire batch so each one of these cookies has roughly forty six milligrams if you have a low tolerance like some of the people in the office do around here they're not eating these because they are just right in the face so please exercise caution proper dosing is the proper way to enjoy edibles thank you for watching

"0UKGMh-vT8Q": "[Music] hi it's mater Rafal studios and welcome to cat Abay six today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused dried fruit using fresh pressed [Music] allowed to thank the guys in my rosin press comm who sent them my press rosin press that we're using today in this video you can save money on to my press with a code roughhouse if you want to pick one of these up you can check that out at my rosin press calm now here's what's gonna need to make cannabis infused dried fruit you're gonna need your fruit and use fresh fruit and you can use any kind of fruit pretty much that you want you can use pineapple banana apples pears or common things to use you could also you're gonna need cannabis gonna need about one gram per fruit serving you also gonna need coconut oil you can use refined if you want less of a smell or flavor in your oil and then more unrefined if you want more the coconut flavor and use organic if possible and the tools that you need you gonna need our rosin press some wax paper and a pollen press now the first step is gonna be to prepare your fruit and start it to go ahead and begin dehydrated because dehydrated fruit can take for a few hours up to almost a day or two so I'm using some pineapple for one portion and if when it comes to dry fruit it's gonna shrink a lot so you're gonna cut a lot more than you think you're gonna need but this is gonna be one serving here of these four pineapple rings here and so I'm cutting them about it's a little over a half inch there I'd say it's about two thirds of an inch thick and you can adjust the thickness of that but pineapple shrinks down a lot when it dehydrates so these are gonna be very thin rings even at that thickness now if you're using a banana bananas don't shrink down as much as the pineapple does so you cut those at about a quarter inch thickness and for the most even chips you can cut them right directly across but if you want kind of large ones if you have an oven or if you're using a dryer that rack that doesn't have big spaces in it you can cut them sort of julienne style and make them a little bit wider although those those edges that are a little bit tapered there might dry out okay once you have your fruit prepared though you're gonna go ahead and set up whatever kind of dragging mechanism you have I don't have an actual dehydrator but I'm using an oven that goes down to 150 degrees and I saw has a convection fan in it it actually turns into a pretty nice little dehydrator itself it's a small oven also and so I'm using the rack that is provided inside the oven to place my items on it and you want to leave space between them if possible and you can see I'm putting the pineapple on on the outside and I'm also loading in the bananas but I already know in advance that my bananas are gonna go a lot faster than the pineapples so I'm gonna be prepared to take those out and I'm putting that in that oven at 150 degrees Fahrenheit and mine goes at two hours at a time and it took several times to do it to get even the bananas ready it took a little over four hours and in the meantime then so now I'm going to go ahead and start preparing my rosin and to prepare my rosin I'm first making these little pouches and we're gonna be reviewing this my press rosin press very soon and when we review that I'll show you a lot more detail how to use this according to the manufacturer's instructions but what we're doing now is we're also after we prepared our pouches that we're going to use for the press we're also using a pollen press these are the items that you can find on Amazon I'll put links in the description for where you can find the pollen presses on Amazon or you can use something similar like that but we're making a puck that's almost a gram of cannabis with something compress down into that tiny little puck and then we're putting that puck inside of the pouch that we made and again in the next week or so we're going to be putting out a video with a lot more detail about how to use this rosin press machine in particular but however you're using your rosin press the reason we're using rosin is because we want to concentrate a form of cannabis but personally I don't feel safe using any sort of concentrates that's made with any sort of solvent and this is a way that you can make solvent free cannabis extracts at home and be safe to use them especially if you know that the cannabis is safe already so if you have cannabis that's already been tested then you'll be able to safely use the rosin and I have to worry about pesticides or residuals of solvents and you can see there I have the press going down there presses about a minute and this one at about 220 degrees Fahrenheit and you can see it's pumping out it's almost like it has a pulse inside of it it just keeps pulsing out these little globs of wax and you'll see once this press has done that it's a really beautiful amber color as well I'm pressing a an OG strain of an heavy indica I obtained that at Club 52:52 in East LA shout out to those guys and there you can see that the rosin that comes out is it's just so beautiful it's it's even in glob that for him like that it's still a very almost opaque amber color and it's got little tiny little pieces of plant material in there but that's nothing compared to making a an extraction with butter or oils using the whole plant ground up into it and so you can also get those out later so I'm gonna press about two grams because I have two different servings and I'm making hair so form one for my banana and one for my pineapple although I already know in advance that the pineapple is gonna get a lot more of the oil than the banana so it's gonna be about two thirds for thee or actually about three quarters of it for the pineapple and about one quarter of it for that small amount of banana and there he goes the second pressing pretty good yields on that and those pups can be repressed again and obviously you can use those pucks to make butter oils as well so we'll go over a lot more detail about how to use the press to efficiently and future videos but for this video we're we're sticking to the to the task at hand of infusing some dried fruit so I've taken ten milliliters of the coconut oil I've have some organic and I'm using unrefined coconut oil because I don't mind the flavor of the coconut I actually think especially with the pineapple and even with the bananas that it gives it a nice little kind of tropical flavor and it really is nice though I like that and another tip - you can also soak your fruit with a little bit of lime juice or lemon juice in advance if you don't want it to tarnish yellow and that can help too if you if the yellowing bothers you start digress on that back to the rosin though you can see I've taken all the rosin that I pressed and I've dropped it into my coconut oil and now I put it in the oven for about 35 to 45 minutes at 250 degrees I did that for two reasons one to dissolve the oil the solvent the oil and the rosin together and one also to finish decarboxylated because that that press D carved that cannabis some but I also want to make sure it was fully activated so that oven for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes we'll achieve that and I'm also just out of curiosity I want to test the potency of it and you see the tiny amount of wax that I put over the rosin that I put in there and it made an oil that was 141 milligrams per tablespoon or 9.6 milligrams per milliliter which is the ratio that I'm going to with here which is almost perfect it's it's nearly 10 milligrams per milliliter and I have a syringe that's 10 milliliters but it actually filled up with about 11 or 12 milliliters there so what I have is just about a hundred twenty milligrams of THC and you could see that the oil there was very light-colored and if I had made a can of butter with that potency it would have been a very dark green cannabutter so you can see that the flavor is gonna be brighter and it's gonna be a lot more say palatable you hardly even notice the flavor of the cannabis at all actually it's a very lemony high lama named flavor to the cannabis anyway the terpene is strong with limonene and so when it's reduced down like that it just kind of almost just adds a tartness you don't really notice the candles okay so very efficient a very effective way and you could have pressed it one or two more times and put that wax in there and you would have really really strong you would have like 250 milligrams and this just little sauce serving of fruit here and you can see my fruit is not finished yet the the pineapple still has a lot of moisture at that point and so what I did there you could see me when to syringe while I was talking I was using the syringe to evenly spread that cannabis out and then brush it into both sides of the fruit before I finished drying it so about halfway through the drying is when you add the coil to it and then over the last couple of hours of drying it'll absorb into the fruit but you see the bananas actually came out a few hours before the pineapple that pineapple took a good maybe 10 12 hours to actually get dried in that oven and then I actually trimmed the pineapple down into little pieces like that it looks a lot more servable if you just trim off the little kind of rough edges again I like to thank the guys that my rosin press calm they sent out to my press rosin press that we use in this video it worked great and like I said we're going to be reviewing that product but if you'd like to check it out in advance you can save money on it with a code ruffhouse at my rosin press calm and stay tuned for more about that again

jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down

journey gummy bears bears they're made out of fruit juice it totally works with my new year's resolution", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "2Es9trMOWkI": "welcome to County basics today we learn how to make double dose chocolate marijuana brownies [Music] what do you do with classic weed brownies just doesn't do the trick you make double dose chocolate marijuana brownies and hop up the THC with two layers of cannabis infused chocolate heaven the main brownie is loaded with cannabutter and the icing is also infused with cannabis coconut oil but you could also use butter in that layer too either way these double dose brownies are guaranteed to be a kick in the pants this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling vaporizers wax pans rolling papers and accessories from raw and much more at great prices save 10% on everything all the time with the code canna basics and roughhouse studios.com now here's what you need to make the brownies but be sure to note that the icing ingredients are towards the end of the video you need 1/2 a cup of cannabutter a cup of white sugar 2 eggs a teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder now unless you already have some kind of either made the first step is going to be to make your cannabutter you can definitely use pre bought or store-bought cannabutter for this but we're gonna make our own there'll also be a link in the description and at the end of the video to see how we made this water method of making cannabutter but the first step is going to be to manicure your cannabis make sure that you break it up take out any stems and seeds and then decarboxylate activate it an oven 350 degrees for 30 minutes while that's baking you want to also clarify your butter clarifying your butter it means that you're removing all of the milk solids so that you have a nice yellow pure clear butter oil this will make it more bioavailable it'll also help make the infusion more strong when you infuse the marijuana after your marijuana has decarboxylated it's gonna be lightly toasted brown and we're going to combine that with the butter and then we're also going to combine some water an equal part of butter and water that's one cup of each and then we're also going to add in the cannabis and that's about a 1/2 ounce of of cannabis there and you can definitely vary the amount of cannabis depending on the potency that you want and if you make this amount of cannabis butter you'll have more than enough to do the recipe that we're making today and you'll also have about a quarter cup left over and you can also do like we're doing it combined and you were using part coconut oil and we're also using part of this infused butter but now you got going to strain out your after you've infused for at least two hours over a double boiler you're going to strain out the cannabis and then to separate the water from the butter you could put that in refrigerator for a couple hours and let the water settle to the bottom and then the butter reforms at the top and then you have a nice very good flavored a little bit lighter colored sometimes than other cat about is because you can see the rust colored waters left over there but that's taking away some of the bitter flavor and chlorophyll and impurities away so you have a very clean and a pure butter that's left over its gonna taste delicious and our brownies okay so now we're going to move on to making the brownies [Music] okay we'll begin our brownies by first putting our half a cup of Canada butter over a medium saucepan bringing that up until it's melted and just before it starts to get too hot and start to brown so you want it hot but not not starting to smoke or anything like that so make sure you don't brown the butter and then after it's hot throw it put it in a a dish like a pyrex dish here and then add in your cup of sugar we're good doing this to help melt the sugar and also to cool off the butter so that when we add our egg and next it won't cook our egg so then add in your eggs one at a time and mix those in and then we're also going to add in the vanilla extract it's one teaspoon of vanilla extract again mixing it well and once we have our wet ingredients in there we're gonna now first add in our cocoa and once I add in the cocoa I want to go ahead and mix that in because cocoa can be really messy so I like to go ahead and get the cocoa mixed in before I had in the rest of the dry ingredients so I've got the cocoa mixed and now I'm adding in the flour all-purpose flour one cup I'm adding in a half a cup at a time so it mixed in the first half a cup and now I'm going to add in the second half a cup of flour but then I'm also going to add in the baking powder as well as the salt we're gonna continue mixing that until I have that oh very well incorporated it could take a couple of minutes and what's that well until it's nice and glossy and fully combined now we're going to go ahead and spray and flour my pan I've also lined it in foil that'll just help me pull the brownies out of the hand when I go to cut them but go ahead and oil and flour that generously or they may stick now we're gonna add in the brownie batter you can see the brownie batter is really thick and dark and there's gonna be some really good fudgy brownies so I've got that I'll pour it in the pan I've hit the pan once on the table and let it settle in there and now we're gonna bake the brownies these brownies bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes you want to sure you keep an eye on those you don't want them to get too Brown but you also want to make sure they get done and you can use a toothpick and stick it in the center if it comes out clean you know they're done [Music] and now while our brownies are cooking we're going ahead and combine all the ingredients for our frosting which is 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder a cup of powdered sugar 3 tablespoons of cannabutter or cannabis infused coconut oil a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of honey we're to combine all of those ingredients into a medium bowl and we'll be combining those all together and in this instance we're using a coconut oil that we already had made that's a really strong coconut oil we want these double those brownies to be really potent so we're using this really extra strong coconut oil but you could also use the same butter that you used in the first half of the recipe you could use that butter or any kind of cannabis infused butter or coconut oil for this part of the recipe and then we've combined all our ingredients here and now we're going to use a spatula or metal spoon and make that combined together into our frosting and ours was really dry so I added in actually some of the butter I ended up adding some of that in as well too to wet it some so that it was the consistency of her frosting it was still a little bit thick but that's ok because we're gonna frost these while the brownies are still hot so we're gonna let the heat of the brownies kind of help melt this fudgy icing it which is more kind of another layer of brownies than it is actually in icing but it just really is delicious and it really adds to the potency especially if you use a really strong oil for this top layer but what you're using is you're letting the heat of the brownies that have come out of the oven they're completely done but they're still warm and we're spreading this fudgy icing over the top of it and we're letting the heat of the brownies kind of melt that icing so that it forms a nice sort of dense layer of fudge on top of these brownies and once that's cooled off you're gonna be able to especially if you use the foil just lift it right up out of the pan and cut these I cut these into 12 sections so that would be at 12 servings but it's up to you to cut them have any slices that you want they're kind of small brownies in this case but these are really rich they're almost almost like a piece of fudge they're very very rich and they're also very strong so the 12 slices was perfect and take a look at those dark and dense and I tell you these are some dank and strong brownies one of these is enough for a serving two of them will really kind of get your mind blown if you use a strong infusion like we did here they're very moist and I used a really high-quality cocoa so they have a real rich dark chocolaty flavor this episode of Canada basics is brought to you by the

they've been slightly decarboxylated at um 180 degrees at all i don't think and for two minutes at 180 degrees river you're not getting any decarboxylation you got to go up to 275 river there's a huge difference between 180 degrees and 275 degrees and i doubt that there's any decarboxylation going on within two minutes at 180 degrees if you're doing 180 degrees and you're trying to decarboxylate you're looking at like 30 minutes at that at that temperature right right okay so um but it's a great question river is why why do rosin chips get you so high i didn't finish my story you kind of cut me off before i could even start talking but the story is yesterday i was doing rosin and i always take my rosin chips and i put them in this jar and i saved them then i stripped the uh the the oil off of that with um alcohol and then i'll use that to make my trendy paint oil but hey tiffany good morning teresa hi monique you're planning and smoking nice masks you two i'm proud of you monique that's great so well nobody present river nobody presses at 275 you should already know that river um you know don't don't sit there and act like oh i didn't know what temperature you're pressing at though if you're pressing at 275 blah blah what are you [ __ ] what are you talking about river what are you talking about now you're just now you're just trying to show me that you know absolutely nothing about what you're talking about and you're actually trying to talk your way out of not knowing what you're talking about stop if you guys would just admit that you're right i don't know that's why i'm asking instead of trying to act like oh i know i'm just trying to get the i'm just trying to see what you're where you're coming from don't don't come at me like that i [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] it is so fake and phony and i can spot that [ __ ] from a mile away river okay it doesn't matter what temperature i'm pressing at nobody presses it too [ __ ] 75 okay and the reason why is because you don't want to decarboxylate your oil right right you decarboxylate it when you [ __ ] smoke it that's not the point that's not the reason why we are pressing the oil out now along those lines if you were trying to press medicine out of the rubbable medicine out of the cannabis then yeah you turn your plates up to 275 300 degrees squish it out and it will be decarboxylated but that's not really what you want is it you want to smoke these dabs you want to get high and you want to put them in your bong and you want to set them on [ __ ] fire that's the point of this conversation okay and know that they don't get decarboxylated in the in the press of course not so the reason i decided yesterday i had these ooey gooey pieces of rosin chips that were just on the crust on the outside of one of my rosin pucks and i looked at it and i said well i'm not going to press it because it's such a small amount i cut it off and save it and it was sitting in front of me and i'm looking at it and i said man i'm going to [ __ ] smoke that i'm going to smoke it on this show i'm gonna gather that all up that thin pressed cannabis coated with oil i'm gonna flake it up put it in my bowl press it down and smoke it see what happens i don't remember much after that but i do remember this when i to hit that ball i got so [ __ ] high i didn't know who the [ __ ] i was where i was what i was doing i lost complete perception of everything for a couple of seconds i got so [ __ ] high and i thought to myself man that wasn't even a concentrated dab that was some oil sitting on some flat bud flat bud now i get high as [ __ ] when i put oil on a bud and i smoke it down i do and it it gets me more high than a dab it gets me more high than smoking a bowl but man when i smoked those rosin chips that were coated with oil yesterday i got even more high it's not the dry rosin chip okay it's the edges that are covered with oil and this is what i think is going on i think because that cannabis flower is squished so thin that when you smoke it you're literally getting a different chemical reaction with the oil that's sitting on it than when you're just smoking straight bud it might be concentrated heat it might have something to do with humidity it might have something to do with a chemical um meshing that's going on like a um like an entourage type effect and i think that's it i think we're hitting on it i think smoking rosin chips that are ooey gooey with oil like i'm about to do right now for you i saved this from you remember yesterday i told you i was gonna smoke this thing i saved it for today's show i think that it is entouraging your brain in other words you're getting more of everything that the cannabis flower travels with the thc to to spread it around um jack you're not going to change my subject i'm just going to block you you know if you can't stick on subject and you think you're going to you think you're going to control what goes on in the show i'll just [ __ ] block you you know try to try to stick to this subject and maybe you won't get blocked guys that's that's just a little bit of a tip i love to hear from you and i want you to ask me questions i want you to be paying attention what i'm talking about and it's like if i if i walked up to that guy in person and i was talking to him face to face and let's say we're talking about [Music] telephones just grab something random and him and i having a conversation about telephones and i say you know the thing about telephones is is you can have a home phone or a smartphone and the thing about a smartphone is you could walk out of your house and you could use it everywhere now you go in the conversation and he says yeah i like ferraris and porsches well we're not talking anymore are we so it's not sorry to change the subject it's sorry i'm a narcissistic [ __ ] who can't sit for [ __ ] five minutes and listen to somebody else talk you're not the kind of person that i like having conversations with you're the kind of person that when i'm talking to you're not listening because all you're doing is thinking about what the next thing is that you're gonna say that's not a conversation that's a [ __ ] narcissist [ __ ] you all right so where were we this right here is going to get me more high probably than just about anything else i could ever [ __ ] smoke i'm really excited i wanted to share it with you guys this morning let me just find a lighter right here i just jumped on how you been stephanie i've been good thanks for asking steph look guys i understand you guys have your own [ __ ] going on this is not the time to come in here and try to make the show about you okay this is not the time when i'm doing a show like this you guys need to realize it you need to realize oh he's he's talking about something important we should listen and we should participate in the conversation and not come in and show everybody how narcissistic we can be all right there'll be more times when we'll be able to talk about you but this isn't that time all right i i i just uh i just hope you guys get that i hope you understand you know that we're all a big group here we're a family and we need to work together not against each other okay and if i'm the leader of this group and i have a topic then it's up to you to listen to the topic and try to pile on try to add to it try to try to um to foster and and help that conversation grow instead of taking away from it what the [ __ ] is wrong with some of you guys i just don't understand what's going on in your heads man you know this this show's getting way more serious we're getting a lot more attention there's going to be some big names coming in here in the next couple of days and i need you guys to start acting like it you know if you got to pretend pretend but don't act like the show is about you every day you know because it's not and i just need you guys to realize that all right and there's plenty of times when we will be talking and you'll be able to bring up that sort of thing but i need you guys to figure it out man just kind of hey he's talking about rosin chips hey the title is about ross and chips hey he's about to smoke some [ __ ] rosin chips hey he's explaining about decarboxylation and he's talking about you know why this is getting him so high and blah blah blah blah but i want to ask you know what's the [ __ ] price of tea in china what come back on another show okay and and maybe bring that up or maybe when we're all talking about it bring it up this is not your show and if you want to start a show and talk about that stuff go right ahead i i support you you know if i'm not talking about what you want to hear go somewhere else i support you see how hard it is to get 55 people to listen to you for three minutes it's not easy it's really not easy and you can see what i [ __ ] have to deal with then with some of you little narcissistic [ __ ] working against me you know i'm just like uh i'm struggling here guys just to stay [ __ ] treading water it's not a party when i have to block people it's not a party you know it's it's sad i want especially when i have to block legitimate viewers that are just not contributing to the conversation okay i'm gonna get us back on track i'm the engineer i'm gonna get this train going down the track okay you ready we're talking about rosin chips we're talking about the fact that i smoked some uh yesterday and i got more high yesterday than i have been in a very very very long time i had already been smoking i was already high but i hit those rosin chips and [ __ ] something happened so i said today i'm going to wake up i'm going to do a show we're going to talk about rods and chips i'm going to hit that bowl i'm going to see what it does to me and see if i get the same effect that's why it's a question are rosin chips the most potent form of smoking cannabis i don't know but boy oh boy yesterday they sure seemed like they were so here we go without any further ado yes river i explained it to you it's like you ask questions and then you don't listen to the answer i'm going to say it again yes you can carve box you can decarboxylate at temperatures lower than 180 degrees or lower than 275 degrees yes but it takes a much longer time not the two minutes or three minutes that it's in a rosin press getting pressed out you're not decarboxylating at 180 degrees you're just not and that's got nothing to do with it and besides use your brain river as soon as your lighter hits that cannabis you're decarboxylating it anyway why would it matter if it was decarboxylated before decarboxylated while you're smoking it it's the exact same chemical process it's the exact same stuff going into your lungs it makes no sense so do me a favor i appreciate you participating in the conversation but that's got nothing to do with it so just let that go okay that's not it it's not decarboxylation it's the wrong path you're walking down are we good i want to hit this [ __ ] ball it's going to catch on fire and i'm going to celebrate all right no law regarding cannabis cannabis isn't chiseled for all i'm doing my donald trump cheers why because easter easter sunday be a beautiful day for the covey to just disappear and people will all be in the peers of the churches celebrating and reveling and worshiping their dear dear leader me donald j trump the ruler of the world hey moo rhino man moo moo i wish i'd see you more often my friend good to see you cheers to you uh that guy came in and said not to change the subject and i really i wasn't really too interested in reading what else he said after that just to start a sentence off with not to change the subject that's like starting a sentence off with i'm going to be an [ __ ] here you should have just said that i'm going to be a subversive non-supporting narcissistic [ __ ] here and ask you a completely non-related question to what you're discussing right now and that's why i know some people don't read the chat when they're doing shows like this but man i'm always going to read your chat even if it's scrolling by at a million miles a second i'm always going to read your chat and when we do interviews your chat won't be on screen but i will still be reading your chat understand that um i'm not gonna let some [ __ ] troll [ __ ] say something that's gonna fly across the screen during one of my interviews it's just not gonna happen um it's it's nothing against you guys because i know you guys are great but you guys know just like i do i have no control over who comes in here and what they say um and i'm like i said i do have control over what's flashed on my screen and i will control that kelly cox thank you sava what's up long time no see sava wow that was a life-changing dab i did says debbie genman um well i gotta tell you i am h.a.f and boy when i hit that i didn't even know who i was again it is so potent and i didn't even get the most the biggest hit i could have off of it do you guys remember it was the second or third hit off that bowl that got me hey brad i'm glad you made it karsten is a splash willow says morning good morning willow there's the song called willow that none of you have heard it was from a local band in orlando um i can't remember the name of the band it was somebody's name though you know like leonard skinner it was somebody's name um i believe and uh they did this song called willow man i had it on cd i've lost it i'm sure it's gone but it was such a great song man every song those guys did was great i just can't remember the name of their band god i wish uh i wish kazzy the uh cazzy the alien was here he'd be able to tell us the name of that band i bet i think he was at that show that i was at that i'm remembering are you on the moon or mars in a pretty big hit um i'm out there rolling that's a good question i am out in the stratosphere floating around bro in a space suit i am not even landed on a planet busy season brother hope all is happening and fantastic so i am so high right now i'm not the most high i've ever been but i'm so high right now that i'm having a hard time trying to focus on leading this conversation that is a really powerful form of cannabis you guys and we neglect it i'm sure a lot of people neglect those rosin chips i know a lot of people do a second press but i don't like the second press i don't like the material that comes out on the second press you've heated it twice um and it degrades i i don't like it um it's i never get a really good return on the second press because i get a really good return on the first press but man that little bit of oil on the edges of those rosin pucks guys you take a pair of scissors and you cut the edges off your rosin puck and you put it in your bowl i've smoked one hit off of this bowl and i'm like i'm sitting here like i'm supposed to smoke again on this show and i'm getting more and more high as i sit here i am getting more and more high it's creeping on me i can feel it and i can't i can't function which is great i mean that's the point sometimes you know sometimes i i just want to relax and i just want to unplug you know and i just want to get high you know and if i could do it with one bong hit and like let's say i got to go do something today and i don't have time to sit here and smoke for an hour like i usually do i want to get really high really quick so i can go enjoy my [ __ ] morning i'd pack those rosin pucks up in a bong and hit take

normally get and let me tell you something though some of the interviewers out there are fantastic man they've opened up my eyes not only to graham but they've opened up my eyes to how to conduct interviews and the kinds of questions and how to how to research somebody to find out how to ask them good questions you know so i was on i was on um wikipedia reading about him and uh listening to how other people have researched him and he even complimented somebody i loved it he's like man you know i've done a few interviews he's like but i really appreciate you taking the time to actually

always look at them don't you gotta watch their eyes their eyes are giving away their eyes will tell you what's going on i'm going to check that video out right after your stream what video what video dave girl speaking for michael attacks me or tries yeah yeah she's attacking a lot of you i've been watching that i i'm trying to stay out of it as much as possible but i will i might you know she says enough do you know what i just said to her at first i said you know what when you need the oil you can play you can pay triple price for it she's like i'll never buy your oil i said then you know and then i responded to that i said you know what then never how's that you'll never have any how's that or i said is that better oh and i think i'm at carson i think i'm out but i got to tell you i i really enjoyed the back and forth because i know how much [ __ ] pain oil helps people triage oil helps so many people and i know it helps me it makes my life better let me tell you something and let me tell you if this has ever happened to any of you press number one i'm laying in bed late at night and for me it was an electric shock feeling in my um it was i think it was in my knee i told you guys about this it was in a spot where i'd never gotten it before and i was like oh my god i was like it'll go away it'll go away it wouldn't go away after like 10 seconds it was really bad i was like i got trendy paint oil next to my next to my um look david c baker's already hitting one if you've ever been in bed and you've ever had a pain and you reached for your triage oil and it helped you press number one i was laying in bed i reached for my triage oil i put it on that thing that felt like an electric shock it was a nerve pain from when i had a motorcycle accident back in i broke my neck back in 2000 or 2001. i don't i forgot it's like erased from my memory so i can never remember the year isn't that weird i think it was 2 000. i i figured out by going to seriously i don't know but if i went to my youtube channel and checked out the year that i did a show at the house of blues and i think just look at the year that's the [ __ ] year it was thanksgiving that's the year that i broke my neck in february march february or march can't even remember that i can't remember the month so anyway that's not me losing my mind that's the fact that i got hit by a car so hard that it affected my memory from that portion of my life i can remember very little from that those years it's it's really it was traumatic i had the traumatic brain injury i'm sure my brain got rocked so um i grab that pain oil i rub it on the [ __ ] shop it goes away as soon as the oil touches the skin i'm like i put on like oh god instant relief i was like oh god i was like i am so thankful that i made this i am so happy i am so happy that i made this and that i've got it sitting next to my bed when i need it it's there for me when i need it i'm so happy i put it next to my bed i put it back and i went right to sleep and i just i felt so good knowing that i was like man i thought one of the last thoughts i had that night when i went to sleep it was just like a week or two ago was was i'm so proud of myself for inventing this [ __ ] this is just i'm just so fulfilled right now this is just amazing and i went and you know to have that thought and a [ __ ] what the rest of you say because you know i might be a cool guy and people might think that every single one of you is a lackey ball licking [ __ ] a wannabe you know suck-up brown-nosing audience member you know everyone else like that stupid [ __ ] [ __ ] looking in would assume that about all of you but i know from my own personal experience how this has changed my life and i know from all of you telling me your personal experiences that it's changed your lives too that it's not just [ __ ] my own personal perception or placebo you know that really helps and when i've got something that feels like it i'm sticking my finger in a [ __ ] socket it feels like i'm [ __ ] getting an electric shock and this makes it go away i'm [ __ ] man i think about that dumb [ __ ] on twitter and i think to myself you know the the audacity of people like that is unmeasurable and i can't even begin to fathom the amount of of ignorance it would take somebody to ignore hundreds of people on twitter with hashtag trendypaintoil saying it did this it did that it did this it did that it did this it did that it did this over 50 uses here's the 50 uses it did this here's a picture of my neighbor's knees it did this it did that it did this it did that here's my name here's my name here's my name here's running here's my facebook here's my facebook here's my twitter here's my twitter here's my facebook here's my facebook here's my twitter here's my twitter here's my facebook here's my facebook here's my twitter here's my twitter here my twitter here's my facebook here's my facebook and all of you guys are real people and you're all here watching the [ __ ] show and like i said i'm shocked at that dumb [ __ ] on twitter shooting her fat [ __ ] [ __ ] mouth off as i am as that feeling when i feel like i'm sticking my [ __ ] finger in a [ __ ] socket in the goddamn wall and i'm not mad that michael malus is not accepting this do you guys remember what i told you about a week about a week ago i said please don't tweet at michael malus and i'm not trying to do a [ __ ] streisand effect here you guys stopped and that's what i needed i needed you guys to stop and you guys knew it wasn't looking first i wasn't going like this and you guys know when i'm being sideways and you guys knew i was being dead serious and what did i say i said i'm a fan of his i love him my heart is broken that i can't see his tweets every day i wish he would let me follow him again and i won't ask him if i can send him free triage oil anymore there's plenty of other people out there who are going to beg me for it you know and i'll gladly send it to him i have no problem with that it doesn't have to be him you know he's going to eat his dick when he sees me on rogan he's just going to be like boy was i wrong about that guy and then he's going to hear my story and he's going to be like wow you know he's just he's gonna [ __ ] apologize i guarantee you he's going to [ __ ] unblock me on twitter and he's going to [ __ ] apologize to me and then i'll send him a [ __ ] bunch of [ __ ] pain oil i will but i was so sincere and and i am still so sincere and i just appreciate you guys leaving it be and letting it go and not beating the dead horse and tr and and when you're when you're engaging this dumb [ __ ] on twitter try to not at michael malus i mean by now it's probably [ __ ] impossible there's so many acts on him if you guys can drop it too that would be great carsten steve running you know i know she's a pretty girl and i know you guys are probably inclined but do it as a favor for me just let's drop the whole [ __ ] thing i i mean you guys ever all of everyone knows everyone knows you know steve knows carsten knows i know nick brown knows david c baker jr definitely [ __ ] knows you know as sure as the fact that david c baker is sitting there watching the show in the nude right now he knows that this [ __ ] [ __ ] works and and i'm telling you from the bottom of my heart that it has changed my life um and i don't need to sell you a drop i'll send it to you for free number two i'll tell you how to make it yourself you know it's a message it's not a product for me to make money off of anymore and you know this is a message and that is a message and i have no problem with you guys going yo nay man where'd you get the hoodie with the goddamn oh have i told you no no why am i pushing it down your throat no do you guys know that i only had a couple of these yeah you guys know that i'm not trying to market your asses if i was hey man i'd be on here [ __ ] marketing saying but the reason why that is there and i will let you guys know and this is not sideways and please don't start ordering [ __ ] from me but for you die hards out there and i know there's a few of you that are dying for this um these are available in black hoodies black teas white tees but not the [ __ ] any size over xl in white tees every size in black tea every size and hoodie um they're available and the back the back of these hoodies so when you put the when you put the hood down it doesn't cover the navy's so i know that you guys i know that you guys are uh are down with the triage you know um and um i know some of you guys might have been holding out but i want you to know i made this and i have the ability to make it for you now too the only thing i don't have are the extra-large anything over extra-large white tees but i have a feeling now that you guys have seen this on black i have a feeling you guys are gonna want this on [ __ ] black you know when i saw it on black i was almost ready to dance in the garage and when i saw it i was like i looked at it i was like man that looks good on black i was like cool because i didn't know you know i was like okay great because i was like it's what's it gonna look like um and i was talking to my sister about this and i said hey you know how we're like there's a double entendre with the triage oil tree a try age you know like it's for all three age groups children adults and the elderly you know that's the tri age or triage what you get before you you know go into a hospital you get triaged you don't need to go hospital if you use this right it's double entendre well it's [ __ ] triple entendre now look at this this thing right now if you were in a hoodie like this or if you had it on your back imagine if you're in an area like a like i've got people like i've got rhinos this is serious i'm serious i've got friends who are all over the world okay i got i got hash he travels around i never know where the [ __ ] he's gonna pop up you know i've got um i've got uh uh yuri who i haven't seen in a while he's you know doing federal contracting whatever the [ __ ] these guys are doing they're out they can be in places and spots whatever imagine this you're out and you're freaking you're wearing your you're wearing your triage oil right and you're in a dangerous area where there's you know [ __ ] going on whatever and someone sees this and thinks you're you know oh that's that's a medical medical personnel save your [ __ ] life could save someone from getting shot in a war zone if they were wearing this so um god my neck my neck i got a big neck huh what is my neck's getting big what my neck what my freaking neck is getting big what am i a football player what am i a freaking linebacker now what's going on here with

i've told you guys to go to the website it's right there naysgarden.com it says international shipping ship everywhere it hurts me but it's okay you know you end up paying a half you're because you're paying you know twelve dollars shipping you and it's free shipping so you end up paying half of what everybody else is paying really when you consider your shipping costs upwards of twenty bucks psychotic but i forgot that because like i said i'm not trying to make money off of this at all that's why international orders get to go and if you guys want to sponsor an international order you can

guys jeremy here and welcome back to the channel so today we're going to be talking about the better delights delta 8 blue raspberry gummies from the company creating better days and i gotta say the name that they chose for this line better delight is great because it definitely delivers there now for those of you who don't know as of the recording of this video delta 8 thc is a fully legal form of thc that is derived from hemp it's about one third to one half the potency of delta 9 thc which is its close cousin that's founded marijuana and the experience that you should have with it when used appropriately is purely relaxing it kind of strips away the potential for the paranoia or whimsical type of high that you can find with delta 9. also no munchies there's none of that insatiable appetite boost that you get with delta 9 a lot of times now it can have a little bit of an appetite stimulating effect but it's really nowhere near what people would define as the munchies i've just found myself getting slightly more snacky sometimes when i use delta 8. now i always like to give kudos to companies that can put out a product with excellent design and packaging and these guys definitely deliver on that as well it just looks so clean and professional and trustworthy that's the big thing because this industry there's so much out there that is not trustworthy in the hemp and cannabis industry these guys i have been carrying them here in lovely leaf naturals for a long time before they even made delta eight gummies carrying their gummies carrying some of their other products and i have never seen anything but absolute professionalism from creating better days and this product is no exception these are 10 milligram gummies so each gummy is going to have 10 milligrams of delta 8 thc in it their blue raspberry as i mentioned before and then there's 60 of them in the big jar they're also doing a 30 count jar but yeah full transparency i do carry creating better days in my shop and on the website so i've been carrying them for a while and they've never given me a reason to doubt them so you can get these over at the lovely leaf naturals website loveleafnaturals.com i'll put a link down in the description they're 49.99 for the 60 count jar we don't have the 30 count jars in just yet i don't know what those will be going for i think either 30 or 35 once we actually get them in the shop but yeah you can get these right now but stick around until the end of the video and i'm going to give you guys a discount code to get 15 off your first order of these so the first thing you're going to see whenever you open these up is that there is a seal across the top it's a tamper resistant seal that makes sure that you know if anybody has opened this jar before you it also says potent use responsibly and we will talk a little bit more about that in a minute but when you open it up you are going to see these square blue raspberry gummies they've got a sugar coating and they are delicious and i'm going to try one right now and yeah they're so yummy i hate that i can only eat a couple of them i kind of want to eat the whole jar now the consistency of them is a little gooier than i generally like my gummies but honestly this is not supposed to be eaten like candy so when people get into the flavor or the the consistency of gummies like this that always kind of bothers me i know i just talked about how good they are i mean it's not a bad thing for them to taste good but honestly you shouldn't worry too much about that because this is more like you're taking a vitamin than you're sitting down to have a snack for example the gummies that we manufactured under our brand name friendly hemp here in the store they taste extremely hempy because there's about 40 milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in each of our little tiny gummies there's not much room for anything else so we don't overload them with sugar we just let them taste hempy but that's not me knocking these guys at all these gummies are amazing i wouldn't change a thing i'm just making the point that when it comes to somebody buying gummies in the cbd space or the delta 8 space or even the delta 9 space don't worry so much about the consistency or the flavor because you're probably just gonna be eating one maybe two and then you're not gonna eat anymore for a good long time now getting back to the subject of using this responsibly i always tell people start low and go slow whether they're here in my shop or they're asking me questions personally about cbd and delta 8. delta 8 you really really really want to start at the lowest dose i would recommend only taking one of these gummies if it's your first time using it waiting several several hours just to see what it's going to do and then maybe upping the dosage next time you want to take it i would not crank down two three of these the first time you've ever taken it now just to give a personal anecdote about this the first time i ever tried delta eight i was woefully ignorant of the potency of this stuff i was using an oil tincture instead of the gummies but i took about 30 milligrams equivalent to about three of these gummies 30 milligrams waited about four hours nothing happened i have a really really slow metabolism that was a big contributing factor to this but then i decided okay well i feel nothing i'll take another 30 milligrams see what happens about an hour hour and a half later is when it all decided to hit at once i was in the shop at that point and i ended up having to close down the shop an hour early i was laid out on our couch i threw up three times in the bathroom and i was just a mess i called my wife and i said you have to come get me because i cannot drive home and i was fully there mentally but my body just gave up on me so i tell people that as a cautionary tale start low and go slow whether you're taking it in a gummy form like this using a vape using an oil tinger using flour whatever you're doing start low and go slow and then just like every other cannabis product that we carry here in lovely leaf naturals these guys are sporting a nice little qr code on the back of their packaging so that you can see the lab results for this product that is a standard that we maintain very very seriously here at lovely

first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

Thursday", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "g74EZiNHdZk": "so I'm going to actually start the demonstration it's going to go throughout the duration of the talk we're going to test the oil beforehand and we're going to test the folks and so I have two hot plates this is on a higher setting that's a little bit above 300 degrees Fahrenheit the cooler plate is around 270 degrees so I did the experiment earlier we got really nice reaction here and slight reaction here so I'm gonna start them up have about a half grand each and josh is actually gonna we're going to livestream this onto this monitor right here so we can actually see what's going on you have to make sure that you've applied heat at some point for the right amount of time and it's the right temperature and in the right conditions to achieve decarboxylation I'm gonna dive right into some chemistry on well what is it what is decarboxylation the plant cannabis plant itself produces mainly the acid form of THC THC is that molecule that is that gets you high okay it's that it's that molecule that's mostly responsible for what you feel however the plant doesn't produce that much CHC what it does produce is THC acid THC a that maliki work there those sticks and stuff that what that is is a is the way the atoms are connected in that molecule and that's what interacts with the molecules in your body in your brain to get you high right except this one is a little bit different from that one the difference is that COOH group called a functional group there's an extra bit of atoms uruk's and extra four atoms actually Adam - Adams here that are three atoms here that are not here right you guys see those one two before and three and the CEO comes out you only have an H left over so this part of the molecule comes off that's called decarboxylation this is carboxylic acid when that comes off is called decarboxylation that's why that's why it's called that it's because then that group and comes off as anybody know what it comes off as but what it looks like when it comes out when it comes off champagne bottles problems yeah anything else like what is that what is it though we've heard of that carbon dioxide is what we breathed out right that's at least in part of what we're seeing here it's co2 okay co2 is a gas it's what we exhale it's really commonly found in the atmosphere and more and more and more these days but but that's what comes off the molecule in decarboxylation the reason people have been smoking cannabis for thousands of years instead of just eating it wrong is because that's what works and that's what works because when you're smoking you're applying heat but initially that was really the only way to get the cannabis into your lungs so people thought that that's why it worked but no you also it also has the added benefit of decarboxylation which is required to feel the psychoactive effects so that this is what we do and how we can figure out whether a product has been decarboxylated or not we what we do we take a sample in whether it's bud or or an oil right or Adi Carville like Rick Simpson oil or an edible or virtually anything and we what we do is we aggressively extract all the cannabinoids from that sample and then we process that and we process it there loot it and then we inject it on our HPLC which is high-performance liquid chromatography and what that does is it separates all of the cannabinoid from each other that's what yeah this is actually this was injected like yesterday and this is a this is a file that contains ten different cannabinoids there's that guy right there is CBM this is THC this is THC a alright that's CBC there's CBD a there's CBD there's CBG a we do a bunch of different categories okay and the point here is that you can see individual molecules and how much the size of the P indicates how much of that molecule there is alright so if somebody brought us a flower this right here is not very typical but it's a flower right what we see here is all of this this molecule is there right what is that THC a we see this molecule which is cbda this is about a one-to-one sort you know close to 1 to 1 CBD THC flower this is um this is where THC comes out there's very little THC compared to the THC a in the CBD a in the flower because the flower doesn't produce THC produces THC a ok this is another sample a different sample this is a debauch ciliated edible okay this is an edible from which we extracted all the cannabinoids and what you see here is that there's very little THC a and a whole bunch of THC and this one is actually seeping in there's a little bit of CBN creepy ok so what's what's going on why why are we does that make sense you guys you guys heard of that why is there cbn what yeah so yeah it oxidizes the THC is oxidizing that's right that's right exactly so so we do have you know we are very often we focus on this one reaction of THC a you apply heat you get THC however anytime you put a molecule of pretty complicated molecule into heat into the presence of heat it's going to maybe react and and produce something else okay so THC what he gives you CP n as well and not just CB n actually gives you a whole bunch of other stuff we're gonna start breaking apart under heat so when you are decarboxylated from THC a and to THC you want to be very careful because if you apply a lot of heat you are destroying your THC molecule and you're making other things such as CBN you know what temperature that happens that mmm it'll happen at least a little bit at every temperature but the point is to tonsure alignment every reaction is you know chemical reaction when a molecule becomes a different molecule or two molecules become a third molecule or one molecule falls apart into two molecules all of that happens it's no real you know it's always like a real thing falling apart in this case we have a THC a molecule and it falls apart and how fast that happens you know we can do some experiments that people have done a lot of experiments to figure out what you know what makes it go faster what makes it go slower what you know how does this reaction behave you know so so I want to talk a little bit about reaction rates just to first understand that zero order reaction means that the it doesn't matter how much of that molecule there is the reaction happens at a certain rate so if you take a gram of THCA just pierre thta and leave it at a temperature if it was a zero order reaction then every say our you have a certain number of THC a molecules converting into THC a first-order reaction is a little bit different and that the rate depends on how much of the material you have how much of that mom's will you have if you had our gram of THC a the reaction will be faster than if you had a half of a gram of THC a pair of all units is for common concentration not grandpa grandpa mailers so a first-order reaction the more of that molecule you have the faster the reaction therefore after a little walk a little while the reaction is going to slow down because you're running out of your molecule whereas a zero order reaction that rate is the same whether you are at the beginning of your reaction or at the end okay and the second-order reaction is even more dependent on the amount of that initial reactant been in the first order it's just a very very simplified way of doing it of talking about it we're not going to do calculus today but it is it doesn't but involve a little bit of calculus it turns out that B carboxylation is in their case it was a in the solid phase what they did was they took but they crushed it up they put it in under vacuum and they heated it at different temperatures they looked at how quickly the THCA disappeared so they took it out every 5 minutes and they saw and what they saw was that it's a pseudo first order reaction there's something that I think you guys have all kind of seen in that the amount of thta you have to really work for that lasts a little bit of decarboxylation you know you can get 50% of it pretty easily 75% of it not as easy but you can do it to get up into the 90s it's difficult okay you're now shredding some really fine lines to get to get up there you have to make sure you're not losing THC there's there's just a lot more involved but getting that last little bit of THC a to convert ISM is as easy as the first little bit of THC okay so it does seem to depend on how much THC a there is to begin you know they're confirming that at higher temperatures you get faster decarboxylation than lower temperatures and this is linear with respect to the natural log which is a fancy way of saying first order you can model this take a natural log which is a mathematical function of this you get a straight line and that's what they're seeing is that you get straight lines of the natural log its first order is a short of it all right there's also this really famous little graph that many of you may have seen it will go online it shows you the effect of heating time and temperature on the amount of THC present and the reason I bring this up is that generally there is a maximum and then the THC a begins to go away again and that that little spot at the top that that pinnacle that is very hard to achieve a lot of people either are below it or way above it and they have full decarboxylation but they're really like over here and they've lost a whole bunch of THC happens all the time and it's okay you still you know you do have you have converted all of your THC a and our instruments will show that there's no THC a left but you don't know whether you're at your peak in a perfect decarboxylation you've lost twelve point three percent of your weight so if you start with a gram of THC a and you D carve it perfectly you're gonna wind up with eight hundred and seventy seven milligrams of THC same thing with CBD a to CBD that's it under perfect conditions and if you know how to weight properly hi everyone so my name is Janelle Lindsey happy to be here day tuxedoes a little bit about decarboxylation so decarboxylation has been near and dear to my heart for about fifteen years now a major part of my life and so i'm from boston I'm an attorney but also I am a mom I'm a business owner but I've also been using cannabis as a medicine for going on 15 years now and so after my son was born I got an ovarian cyst and I already used cannabis for recreation and loved it and my doctors were trying to put me on really high levels of acetaminophen and I was worried about my liver and thought you know I hear people out in California and Colorado they're doing good things medical cannabis let me try to make this medicine and so I was back then just doing what everyone else was kind of what I consider like back in the Dark Ages a little bit which is just plugging away in your kitchen and figuring out looking online and doing your own methods and finding out like really what works for you and what what seems like it worked so that's making you know butters and oils and and other topicals and and I was happy with being able to use cannabis as a medicine is very helpful for me but I was not happy with the processes that I was doing I was taking a long time of smelling I really wasn't happy with incorporating a lot of butter and oil into my diet at that point I was in my late 20s then and and wanted to be healthy and that kind of thing and so it was really a blessing that you know medical cannabis came to Massachusetts and then getting access to a place like MCR where you have a lab and so now we are in the space where there's opportunity to do testing and you know I think a lot of people in this room are into that kind of thing is understanding what your medicine is all about I think that we all know cannabis is very powerful in medicine so you can it's so amazing you know almost kind of like slap it together and it'll still do a good job but I think that now when as the medicine is advancing and as people are trying to get more into the science of it there's another deeper level that you can go and try to figure out you know exactly what's going on and so people can we can take it from hey this kind of holistic thing into a real respected piece of science and medicine and and that's what's required of it to get it there so so for me personally when I encountered the lab it was an opportunity to really get some hard data and some answers to the avenues that I was pursuing in order to try to you know bring cannabis medicine or or figure out how to best access it and so at that time so I wanted to today share kind of some of those things that I've learned and discovered along the way with the data and science and then hopefully you know answer some of the questions and I'm sure open up a whole new can of warm of questions with some of the things that we've encountered along the way so just to start I wanted to kind of talk about how we hi I've been approaching cannabis and decarboxylation it really has been from the side of the cannabis flower and decarboxylate in the flower and the materials that come from the flower we saw some extractions being d carved and you know my work has taken me into extractions as well because you know people are using them and they want to use them you know with the Nova but when it comes to you know way that we approached it in the kitchen it's been to actually activate the plant and then in my opinion you have a lot of different ways to use it afterwards you can smoke it and get an enhanced smoke out of it is really simple to kind of make easy topicals and edibles and infusions and other things like that and so when I began you know doing and working on this it was really with crock-pot and that's a really popular way that people use to decarboxylate the heat and the temperature is one the situation is where you really can't hurt it's harder to hurt the cannabis then right then using an oven or something with a more variable temperature because the the crock-pot and the liquid in the crock-pot is going to boil in a more even even rate and so going back to using bud and flower and another point there is we're starting to encounter a lot of cannabis medicine that doesn't have solvents in it like rosin using Keith and some other materials so I do think it's important to understand how decarboxylate in the nuances of Dee carving bud versus oil and other things like that so back to the crock pot so when I came in first artisan crock pot here at MCR I was very surprised because what I had been doing was using the prop pot for about an hour and a half you know making butters and oils or another really popular way is taking you know a bud and sticking it inside a bag and then sticking it in the crock pot and and letting that boil and what we found was that it's very very difficult to get full deep art using the crock pot it takes a long time and this is really a practical demonstration of what we saw in the scientific pseudo first order which is it it's really really hard to crank out that last bit of THC and so this is on these illustrations and the pictures you see is actually from addy carved ID that we put together which is kind of a synthesis about some of the testing that we've done here that's available online for anybody wants to look at it so I will let you see that but I also have some of the raw data behind but I thought would be cool to share with you guys here since we're doing kind of a deeper into the science D carb so I'll just talk to you a little bit about it first you can see actually what's going on data so you can see that you know with your increasing time you are not really much more increasing than the THC that you have there and and even when you're moving from 75 to 90 to 105 minutes you're still having significant amounts of THC a there and then you're looking at almost two hours all over heat and I'm starting to see a degradation in the amount of total THC that you're getting there at the end and you know sometimes when you see variations it can be from the natural variation in the flower when you start to see it multiple times you can think it's from degradation and so that Avenue seemed like a dead end in some respects for getting good good decarboxylation number one because of the time constraint when you're talking to people about D carving and making medicine they want that medicine done pretty quickly and so when you're talking about couple of hours and that seems to be an issue there but also people want full D carb and so then I think the next thing was to start looking at the other the toaster oven and doing testing on that so when you're talking about D car you're talking about the time in the temperature you're also talking about atmosphere you know you're seeing a lot of oxidation from cbn happening from off from oxygen being present while d carving is happening not just from excessive heat there and so when you're looking at for going back to the crock pot here i'm talking about temperature you know temperature that water boils at is 100 degrees celsius so to and 12 degrees Fahrenheit so you're getting again good D carb after six of just 60 minutes you're getting you're you're still having 36:36 percent D carb THC left and you're not getting much better at 90 minutes you're starting to crank out a little bit more but over here we saw a you know 20% loss here and so this temperature you're thinking of a 212 why don't we just try to crank it up a little bit and see what we can do in an oven and we also saw higher temperatures when Michael was talking 110 degrees Celsius so right around the 240 so started doing experiments on a other new toaster oven to see what those would yield and you can get that higher temperature but you're starting to run into the fluctuation in temperature and not being able to control the temperature with the oven so on one end you have the water it's good but the water is never going to boil to a high enough temperature to get you where you want to be and then on the other side you're having an oven we're having the [ __ ] fluctuations in the temperature and the other thing to note about an oven or a toaster oven is that you have the kind of the position of the heating elements being a challenge and getting even feet because if you're have any heating elements everybody knows that toaster oven an oven the heating elements are kind of up here and then you have this middle space and so even if you have know what your oven says it is there's going to be fluctuations 10 or 20 degrees in between so it becomes very difficult I mean people on the dispensary level when they're de carb\u00f3n Keith and that kind of thing they're using ovens with multiple temperature sensors and people are monitoring those so it becomes really kind of labor-intensive there so person at home we were finding that kind of doing it at home was was difficult on the oven side and you can see though how sensitive the processes were only talking about the difference between 212 and 200 40 degrees Fahrenheit you're doing those testing what we did with these guys here was just more of that more battery of testing of of different temperatures really honing in on that temperature right somewhere between that 110 and the hundred degrees Celsius and ended up finding what that right temperature which is not over 103 degrees Celsius and developing a device that that that does that and and this is a sample of one of the tests I brought the broad data from another test that we just did so you're getting full deep heart there and you're not getting degradation to see the end and it's easy for patients to do so one of the things we saw that was really important was getting that even heating as well which is why we kind of moved away from doing something that was a heating element like an oven and really have a a round a heater surrounding the entire so the silicone heater inside here surrounding the entire cavity so you're getting that even heating and then using multiple sensors to control that heating blanket and then using an algorithm that makes sure that the sensors are getting to the right temperature every single time and monitoring that and enrolling through along the way you know we ran into people starting to use the DVR box later for extracts and so here's just an example of pho being deep bar well we noticed with the extracts is that we're noticing a more concentrated product at the end Mike Lee from boil off of residual solvents or again this is vho in this instant so in my personal opinion what I've seen it seems like there is a little more give when you're dee carving wet extracts when something is already in that oil I just think that might make a great point though about using high temperatures with oil and really they're needing to be more data on what loss is happening there because one thing we see Indy carb is is that you know you're quickly getting lost there so I'd like to you know I think the future of D carbon really exploring kind of the fixative property of the oils and then also really doing comparative tests to see you know hey the THC will be there we see that a lot like they'll be a degradation of THC and no CBN so you might think at first glance that you haven't degraded but there's half the THC that was there before so it's going somewhere it's just not being picked up as something that you know it's coming up on the on the test to get to that full decarboxylation of THC without any degradation to CBD and we to CBN and we've done that and I think it's a combination of the lack of oxygen coming in here so no oxygen and then a really really really tight temperature control you know where you're getting to that 100 and again that's what you know that the algorithm varies but it does not go above that internal temperature of 103 C so 218 Fahrenheit and and then there's an outer control on the outer sensor as well so it's a you know it's a cycle that it goes through and it's like a probably Tory algorithms work really hard to get that but that's that's a time in the temperature parameter that you needs it to be at and below and it's very very difficult to get there you know when you're just using kind of at the imprecise methods of the oven in the toaster oven or you know or the crock-pot you find that because of yeah so the we yet so you can fit as much material in here as you can fit in here and you can also do harm just a teeny bit too so it doesn't matter if it's the x pack no it doesn't matter you can fill it up we don't we say don't like jam it in there but you can fill it we do get a you know often ask for a commercial size a bigger size you know and that's the next thing we're probably will come out with the commercial size but part of this in front of my personal mission is to give education and power to people and patient you know and I mean on the patient level and so for them to have a device that is that they understand it's small and that you can people can are start understanding you need so little to actually get your medicine like that's the thing people are using so much now because their methods of decarboxylation are so poor that they're having to use like a people using like you know seven grams to make a batch of cookies that's like ridiculous you know when you're talking about if you're looking at this sample here you know you're talking about 19% THC in the bud that's coming out of that that's 190 milligrams in every gram like think about how many cookies or things you can how many 20 milligram doses you can make with that in one grand twenty you know so you people they can they can realize that that there's a lot of utility here and so I think that's part of it and especially important for people that are you know don't have a lot of money and don't have experience with cannabis so it's an hour and that's enough thank you for pointing out so it's an hour an hour and 15 minutes for total for heat up and cool down time and that's the thing I think you know you have to balance when you're thinking about decarboxylation you want it fast but the temperature is you want to keep it as low a temperature as possible there's a reason why people want to try to do it in like Suvi or in the crock-pot because the temperature is low enough that you keep intervenes intact and the bud isn't burned up you know what I mean and so that was always our desire to keep that temperature as low as possible you know but the the boil the water boil method is just not high enough so pumping it up just a little bit but then keeping it low enough you know you're getting the timing of you know like I said the hour is it's really an hour for the cycle but they heat up and cool down time get you to an hour-and-a-half proper drying room caring really doesn't do significant harm at all so here are some examples of dried and cured so some of them you have zero some of them you have one I didn't went through and did a little more searching on em CRS I I didn't see anything that really was above one point one some of them I saw that was higher and I consider that not very good curing process you know it excessive heat exposure you know being in a hot car being in a hot room you know things that you don't want to be holding your cannabis to so that was just incredible yeah so some of these were around for a couple of months some of them were more fresh but it doesn't there this was just a mix back from caregivers and growers that I respect and do a good job I would yeah probably are only six months yeah so this was the BHO concentrate that we did so here's a starting before the D carb and again and this is an example that BA chose properly properly purged and and aren't decarboxylated so you have 71% THC all in the 80% almost all of it so I think this one was like that calculation it's like three percent be harmed or 5% of total so one percent so then we're seeing the conversion here obviously when as Michael mentioned before when you D car when that THC loses that molecule and the THC loses that molecule there's a there's a conversion there's a loss there so loss of 13% so what we would see expect to see here is a maximum of 71 even though you see th CA is 80% the maximum theoretically there probably possibly could be a 71 percent once it's converted so you multiply the THC a by 0.87 seven and you add that to the THC and we saw that this one when it came out it was a little bit more concentrated again I think from boil off of residual solvents hours fine difference now as far as one so you can fill that thing up to the top of the tree yes and I wouldn't fill it to the top as it would bubble but yes you could fill it what - whatever yes anything yes and this was that Lola you know and this is at significantly lower temperatures and we were doing over here it was a little bit longer you know times rain obviously but again we're not seeing loss and I don't know what the comparison for losses for this again this is the content isn't our like main focus even though lots of people have been using it for concentrates and you know we're actually coming out with the silicone sleeves to put in here so people can because we said you have to put the concentrate honestly if you don't want it he's grating it off the bottom of here so okay so CBD yes it does take more energy than THC but what we found is in that's more volatile than THC as well and it requires sided control and so here's just a little sampling of testing than he did at the 105 and 110 and I have to say I completely disagree with the Swedish paper that said that 110 for 110 for 110 C for 110 minutes got them the full D carb like I said we get the full D carb at 103 C for 60 minutes as part of our so we never go higher never go higher than that one or three and we're getting there so I think you know preserving more terpenes at that point and you're not you know burning off the product so here is just an example of CBD so this is a high CBD strain here you see we barely have any THC at all but you know at night almost 20% CBD so this is like I think Auto - but it was a this was good I push and you can see here you know we're starting out with a maximum 17 and we're already down to the 11% so we're luck well you know there's lots here even at the 105 at 60 minutes and so this is from the testing and the work that we've done the CBD is more sensitive but it's also I think going to be dependent on whether you're having a mix of THC in there as well what I've seen is that the ones that are very very very high CBD are a little bit more or more fickle here so and then you see we still don't have full D card at that point we're getting there but not full I'm wondering - if with CBD it's gonna be necessary to mix with an oil with the high CBD strains and then D carb you know for the fixative properties of the oil that's something we're going to be looking into one thing I happened to come across recently was and I ran into it before but I saw that it recently got granted and it was it's a patent for accelerating or limiting decarboxylation reaction in an extract and I don't think I don't know if it has any validity or not but I just thought it was an interesting kind of like you know something that's out there that I wanted to get everyone's opinion on so what they essentially say is that they make an extract in many many respects it looks just like any other making an extra candy carving and so they start by putting it in an oven and then they put it in a alcohol extract and start evaporating it off but the interesting thing is I talked about using a cofactor b6 vitamin to modulate the decarboxylation reaction if they don't give any scientific proof or tests or anything surrounding it but what they do the part that I thought was interesting is they said that if you add a specific amount of this b6 that it will essentially halt the reaction at a certain point and stop any further decarboxylation so I could see that if people weren't interested I do think that the future of cannabis was after people really understand the carboxylation and CBN and how things work differently because you know even we have a lot of people who are searching for CBN and some instances like people vets with PTSD and wanting to create certain things so I think after we understand kind of the basics of getting to the best practices for getting you know full medicine conversion and that kind of thing people are going to start using really tailored cannabinoids and medicine so when the bug comes out like you make different things like here's like a toner for your face and we also have maybe sublingual wrap so you put the butt in it and stick it under your tongue because I think that sublingual use is really under utilized I think it's a great way for absorption a lot better than the digestion for most people and and so we made those wraps me also have these capsules so the d car guide is @ww tinyurl.com /d carb guy aji khan glad that we came up with about myths a deep heart and it's based on the research that we've done here so just kind of the introduction and goes into like what is the carboxylation and then you know kind of discusses some of the things but here's that graph we're talking about nicely like you know be aware of that because it's just you know just be aware of those conditions that you're looking at when people are d carving just like you know be careful if you see like hey here's an here's an awesome D card product and there's like five milligrams of THC and you're like oh that looks amazing but what if there could have been 25 milligrams of THC in there you know what I mean it doesn't seem so great at that point so always ask for like before testing f you know compared to the after testing that's really important adho extract and people think you need to grind before you D carb and that's kind of a method that people use to try to make of Indy card more accurate by increasing like the surface area like you don't have to grind if you're doing like a really precise D card with ANOVA and finding it you know you're starting to try Chrome so if you're you're going to be able to increase shelf life if you're not doing that and then facts and alcohols and using those to prepare cannabis so I'm year old comm signing URL comm /p carb guide", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "yyQk8IZlStA": "so much so much always

it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I

gonna pause this of her well", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "BzE0YPXhj3Y": "so if you click this video it's probably because you want to learn how to make some edibles and you want to make some really easy to do recipes at home edibles which is a good thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post"}
