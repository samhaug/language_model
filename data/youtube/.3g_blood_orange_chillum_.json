{"wIeZqt4TWvI": "this is Ollie again as you can see I'm at work today but I work at a hookah lounge which is actually really good that's gonna help me with my video for my presentation boom boom come on should not forget what you need today for the video an orange an apple corer remover I'm using a big knife and then a small knife you'll see why later and I bet you can use like nuts or if you want to spits and foil it done oh and I forget time let's take for two let's start with the orange at first you want to hold it from the bottom so like just like this okay and then just like cut cut it in a way where you can use the maximum amount of tobacco inside the order toasted pretty far away and then you see how it's kind of wobbly you want to hold it like this then cut like cut it flat on the bottom so that when you're making a hat it just stays up okay when I was strong enough oh the next thing you want to do is you want to carve the inside of an orange so what I'm going to be doing is carving is like asking someone it's up daisies for this is one of the hardest parts Apple coriander you want to try to get the the root of the orange I'm gonna make a hole for it so that as you can see if you're here in the pooka you're gonna have a err pathway from the basin let's put down the side for now after that I'm gonna be making Irish Peach white men today by the way very non flavor I don't actually what I really mad at all my customers here I'm not going to try the tobacco like last time most over here the Clubman dry all the tobacco here so it's going to put as much as I need in the head just like mix it up a little so that flavor is mixed not only like one side of each other's head point map good enough let us spread it out and spread it around I try to do it as you I don't think I still see it there's like an orange bar and then there's the white part of the orange what I try to do is I put the tobacco on the orange part so I leave the white part of the orange without tobacco on it makes it better when you foil the head okay and then you want to leave like last time small hole in the middle for the air pathway okay same as last go-around until you get that circle part that told you why this time with both of your hands stapler for so that the coils sticks to the hole wrench and it doesn't come off the regular Hydra which easier because like once you coil it there's no way it's gonna come off it just sticks to it or that's done now we just have to set up the buco so you want to fill up the water level where the bottom of the stem is like only up do you fill fill up with water right I don't you guys can see it but just like a little bit of almost half a finger at the plate he's a Tom none I showed you last time gonna light up the charcoal put them on top here's hose on a smoker for you this time but I'm fasting so I can do that today I met couple hours actually I can but that's all for today thank you so much", "2NpeFLMPd48": "hello everyone a couple weeks ago my wife and I became parents of a newborn for the second time and it's nice to be out and doing some gardening and being in front of the camera and showing you guys plants so today we'll be looking at this blood orange there are three types of blood oranges that have been recognized and they're discovering more and more types the three that are a little bit more old-school are the blood or the moral blood orange and that's the more popular one there's the taco and then this one is a Sandra Nelly or Sandra Nelo blood orange those are Sonam those are synonymous I've found and in researching these blood oranges this is the type that they generally make juice from - like for instance the Fen Pellegrino blood orange they tend to use this righty I'm an avid citrus tree collector and grower so I had to get all three blood orange types to grow for myself this one I got in the mail two and a half maybe three years ago it's my first ever mail-order tree and it came bare root and finally fruit for us today we're going to show you this this one which is quite surprising for its lice because blood oranges tend to be smaller like the one here this is pretty much a regular orange regular sized orange which is super cool one of the things around the new year it was I forget it was before or maybe even during after I had mentioned that we would taste this blood orange together and after the birth of my son and my mom and my brothers and family came over to visit I shared the blood orange with them and they had a good first tasting so today I'll be cutting into this big one for you and showing you what it looks like on in we have one two three other blood oranges and this really tiny one here so with my oldest son we have a parent-child enrichment enrichment class that we go to and we have a week where we bring snacks to the class and these three blood oranges are going to be I'm going to pick those and share them with the class I think it would be really cool for the kids to try out the last time we brought fruit over to the class it was a dragon fruit that we had grown from our permaculture Resort garden over and aside so yeah I was a little bit apprehensive at first because I wasn't sure if it was too exotic but it was well-received so I'm going to bring more interesting fruits for the class to get a taste but today we'll go in and cut this one up for you so let's get in a tighter shot and I'll show you how to cut this orange off the tree Southern California is where the modern Orange was discovered in and propagated and grown and it's pretty interesting that I ran into someone who grows oranges and this is what they taught me about how to cut oranges off the tree so what you don't want to do is you don't want to pull this orange off the tree what you want to do is you want to cut the orange off the tree and you want to leave this plug here this plug will prevent the basically let your orange last longer and it prevents bacteria from getting inside and rotting it out so if you went and pulled your tree out like your orange off the tree like this this is very very soft and very porous membrane now for bacteria to get in and rot it from the middle so that's something to keep in mind as far as the tree is best to cut it off because you don't want to damage your tree and rip off the bark and expose it to bacteria where then the tree can get infected so here's our blood orange that we just harvested and here it is compared this one is pretty big this is amazing this is on the right here is a typical sized blood orange for this orange if you look at it there's not so much of the blush stuff that's here this one has a lot sometimes the more each more blush you see on the outside the less you're going to see redness on the inside so sometimes it's better to find the ones that don't have that much blush on the outside so let's see here the description for this blood orange is that it is a colorful spring ripening fruit has red and orange flesh or orange I'll start over colorful spring ripening fruit has red and orange Fleck pope needs more heat than moral for sweetness to develop mostly sweetness with red blush Rhine and a tart spicy flavor so this one that ripens between I think it was December and February so let's go and take it to our cutting board and and cut it open and show you what it looks like on the inside so here we have our orange and if you look down here you'll notice that it looks very much similar to a Valencia orange compared with a navel orange so what this means is this is more of a juicing orange and it doesn't peel very easily so what we're going to do is we're going to cut this orange and this is how I prefer to cut it so you have the orange and I cut it on its I guess let's see this is longitude early so right through here and you'll see why so we'll cut it and this is what it looks like on the inside pretty cool huh okay so now with that we can then cut the wedges out like this it's super super juicy right now it's it's just popping out you can see it popping off all the juice coming out like a volcano I forgot to look up the spelling for the red pigmentation that's in here this is a very it's basically antioxidants here and forgot to look up the pronunciation so I can't say the name right now so I'll just put the see the word on the screen it's basically the stuff that has the antioxidants so that's the other cool thing about these let oranges is that they are super healthy for you and it's tart but not not a bad tart it's not where it's like a lemon where you are going to grimace your face to make a grimace on your face so it's very nice Ornish so here's again these blood oranges are basically discovered from as a mutation on a regular growing orange tree and what happens is when you discover a mutation you cut the cut the limb off the tree and you graft it onto a root stock and then you get your tree and then from there the the branches that it makes you do the same and you you propagate your trees that way so yeah that's our blood orange it's the the darker the red the more it tastes like fruit punch so to me it tastes like fruit punch and one that's a good good weight so we've patiently waited 2 to 3 years for this and it's really paid off so that's our Stan janello or Stan Ginelli blood orange ok we guess we'll see you in the next one", "zI-hVg_5vv0": "all right good afternoon everybody it's Jay again so we grow a lot of citrus here in Phoenix Arizona we're really known for our citrus and I get a lot of citrus questions here probably more citrus questions than any which is kind of funny because this is the one of the citrus States so I want to go over a tree real quick here and this is called a Mauro blood orange tree and I got this a while back at Lowe's this was one of the Lowe's semi-dwarf trees and it's a really kind of gotten quite big it's above my roof above my roof line very beautiful tree let's see how green it is all the leaves are perfect it's got its new growth on it it's just looking stunning so this is called the Mauro blood orange and I guess one of the questions that I get the most about this orange is how do I know when it turns red on the inside how do I know when to pick it is it gonna be bloody here in Arizona is it going to be dark red so I guess the easiest way to answer this question is you wanna know if it's red on the inside well they turn red on the outside so see how that orange has turned red and you'll also see that these guys have turned red so what do they look like on the inside are they truly bloody well did you tell me I think that's about as beautiful as a piece of fruit that I've ever seen in Phoenix Arizona so how do you know if they're red on the inside because they turn red on the outside all right guys thank you for watching", "c4XRStPgBK0": "[Music] welcome back guys we are here again um on the first day of spring and i've got this tree right here it is a pretty rare one it's called a um blood clementine or a clementino rubino and um i was moving trees out of the out of like my citrus greenhouse and then i um accidentally knocked off a fruit i got this fruit right here it was sitting just like right here and actually it was about time for it to be picked so we got it right here this is uh one of the special like blood type mandarins that um really don't come by very often it's got this really cool gnarly knobbed um rind and um just wanted to share it with you today and uh we're gonna go right into a test tasting in a sec but this tree here's the leaf what the leaves look like they were kind of ravaged by i guess some slugs and stuff when the leaves were first starting to form so it looks pretty horrible but um most of it is okay and it's getting ready to flush out you can there's a bunch of flower buds and all forming so hopefully we'll get a good fruit set this year probably could stand for another repotting i mean it's probably about right size for this plant but let's go ahead and take a look at the fruit here i'm just gonna i don't have a tripod actually maybe i'll go ahead and get one one second all right guys so i got my tripod and i'll go ahead and take a look at it this uh fruit is um pretty cool looking actually let's go ahead and open it up i'll just um cut into it like this kind of like i normally do i see that it's pretty red there we go it's got a great looking color to it not super juicy but pretty cool cool looking okay so now we will um [Applause] just take a look at it and show it to you like this and then um let's get a segment out and then we're gonna do a bricks test on it got my bricks meter here let's get some juice is pretty pretty bloody get some more up in this area there we go let me take a look at the brick so it reading right around 12. so we'll see how tangy this is i'll give it a little try here taste this one too so it's it's really good it's tangy there is a little bit of sweet to it it does remind me a little bit of the the um raspberry tangor but maybe not quite as sweet actually the the tango had a little bit more i don't like more of a burst of flavor this one is pretty delicious though um you probably could peel this easily instead of cutting into it so cool collectors blood orange or mandarin actually what i would did want to show you was a bud blood too we'll look at that tree one second so here's my bud blood orange which is not a mandarin like the other one so this is a blood bud blood orange now i've got these fruit on it these are supposed to actually color up on the inside as far as getting kind of a red tint to them maybe not so much on the outside it does have a nice orange color to them but we're going to go ahead and pick one of these fruit and do a taste test on it okay so i'll probably just pick this one here see if i can get it off without i usually like to cut fruit instead of twisting it see it's starting to mess up to my a some set of clippers okay so i got the bud blood orange cut and uh clipped off and then we're going to go ahead and open this one too and i did kind of like wash off my plate and the bricks meter but i didn't cut off my i mean i didn't clean off my knife but that's fine let's take a look inside here oh yeah this has some cool coloring too so it did um it does get a nice coloring so this one was developed in florida to color up at least on the inside even though the temperatures don't get too cool at night you know that's what really brings in that special coloring of um blood oranges is the uh cool nights so let's get a brix test on it this one's at 13 so not not much different than the uh the blood mandarin get a taste of it i like the little speckling there on the on the um fruit you can see that okay so that has an excellent flavor has like it does have like a nice berry taste to it with an orange kind of mixed in so uh that's really good now the bricks reading of 13 i guess it doesn't you know sometimes the bricks me readings don't mean a whole lot as far as how sweet and stuff it tastes because this has a really good balance too now yeah these are delicious so well uh just trying to keep it short this time these are two fruits i wanted to share with you it is the uh blood mandarin or clementino rubino and the bud blood alright guys thanks for watching [Music]", "az_8W5Qz4Sw": "Hello, Hookah.org. Paul here once again and\nI\u2019ve got another video for you. This one is a how-to. This one was requested a couple times and\nyeah, I\u2019m gonna make myself a bowl out of an orange. Now, I\u2019ve never actually done this with\nan orange and I\u2019ve got a couple different ideas that I want to try and flush out here. So we\u2019re gonna take a little bit of a journey\ntogether. So, yeah, let\u2019s just dive right into this. What I\u2019m gonna be doing here, instead of\ncutting it in half, which only allows me a very small amount of space to work with, I\u2019m\nactually going to be cutting up here at an angle to create the bowl and leave myself\nmore actual structure into which to cut my bowl port or my stem port. So I\u2019m not sure if it matters which end\nyou use, but I\u2019m gonna go with the navel end, because you know what? Why not. I\u2019m gonna cut inward at a downward angle,\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know, fifteen degrees, nothing crazy and just around in a circle. Boom. There. That\u2019s in theory. Because I want something like pretty similar\nto my favorite bowls, which would be fairly shallow and wide. So for cutting the bowl port I suggest turning\nover your now almost bowl, which gives you a solid base on which to actually rest this,\nfind your center point, understand that that won\u2019t necessarily be the stem. I\u2019d say go in there so that you\u2019ve got\nlike a, I don\u2019t know, reference point and, you know, go around and cut your stem port. It\u2019s like any other bowl so far or any other\nfruit bowl, the very least. And get that out. Now, that is not a clear path by any means,\nbut that should give me the right shape to place this on a stem. All I did here was poke through with my knife\nin the center from one side, then from the other. I\u2019m just twisting it around, as you can\nsee, to open up a path and in theory, and now I\u2019m gonna try this, but in theory, that\nshould be my bowl. I mean, that\u2019s pretty much it. Oranges are such a, like, pulpy, easily destroyed,\nmessed-up fruit that it\u2019s gonna be hard to get clean holes or a really clean cut in\nany of this without a bunch of debris. So just, you know, clear out as best you can. And there you go. Like, that\u2019s from, as best I can tell - like\nI said, this is all theory currently - that\u2019s the bowl. So we\u2019re gonna pack this up, load this up\nwith some delicious tobacco that I think would complement the orange flavor and then we\u2019re\ngonna smoke it and see how it behaves. Now that we have the bowl cut, time to fill\nit. I\u2019m going to use some Nakhla Mint because\ncitrus mint is such a delicious flavor and also because I wanna see how much actual flavor\ncomes out of this bowl. Yes, that seems like a small amount. That\u2019s because I prefer my bowls pretty\nshallow, wide. And when you\u2019re dealing with fruit bowls,\nyou really do want a lot of heat exposure because you need to remember that the bowl\nitself, when it\u2019s clay, metal or glass, heats up and will heat the tobacco from the\nbottom. But with something like this, it\u2019s not actually\ngoing to heat up, so you\u2019re relying entirely on the coals, so you want wide and evenly\ndispersed heat. And that\u2019s about it. I also chose Nakhla because it is such a heat-resilient\ntobacco, which means that I don\u2019t have to worry as much about it being burned or about\nthe coals contacting the tobacco. I\u2019m just going to open up the center here\na little. As you\u2019ll notice, or as you did notice hopefully,\nI fluff-packed this in here and sprinkled it so that everything is very loose. With the single hole at the bottom, if you\ndense-pack tobacco in here, it\u2019s going to get jammed up and you\u2019re probably not going\nto get very good airflow. So now, big piece of foil, over the top, this\ncovers the orange almost entirely. Remember, because you don\u2019t have a lip,\nyou really have to rely on - excuse me - you really have to rely on the length of the foil\nwrapping around the piece of fruit to actually like keep it stuck there. And now I\u2019m gonna poke some holes which\nare, you know, standard holes, nothing crazy. In fact, I\u2019m gonna go ahead and do very\nlarge slits rather than like poked holes because this is gonna need a lot of heat. And all around the outer rim. All right. Yes, that\u2019s sloppy. Yes, someone\u2019s going to complain about it. But now we\u2019re gonna smoke it. And there we go. As you can see, the clouds are really good. Because of the very soft nature of the orange,\nit seals very well with the thick grommet that I have on the stem so I have good airflow\nwithout any leaks. As you can see, I might have been a little\noverzealous with the size of the orange that I chose. You can get pretty much the same effect with\na smaller piece of fruit and I would suggest it because fitting the wind cover over this\nis impossible, but it actually sits there pretty well. Again, because of the soft nature of the orange,\nit seals on pretty nicely over the three Coco Mazayas that I have on top. Even with the relatively small amount of tobacco\nthat I have in this orange bowl, you need a lot of heat because, like I said, you\u2019re\nnot getting heat from below. The fruit itself is not going to heat up in\nthe same way as like a clay, glass or metal bowl and provide like direct heat from below\nthe tobacco. Regarding flavor, the flavor is very good. There is almost entirely mint because this\nis Nakhla Mint, which is a pretty potent flavor, and there\u2019s a very, very slight orange note\nin the background. It increases as the bowl heats up and you\nget more of that orange juice and orange oil volatilize into the smoke, but it\u2019s never\ngoing to taste like you have orange tobacco and mint tobacco in the bowl. It\u2019s always going to be a side-note, an\nafter-note, and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s very tasty. But yeah, if you\u2019re looking for a potent\norange flavor, you\u2019re better off getting an orange tobacco. And there you go. So that\u2019s it.

varieties of blood oranges model taroko and sanguine nail I have two model select shiny firm fruit that feels heavy for its size the orange a yellow skin may have a red blush on it the more wet blush the deeper the flesh color avoid dry skin bruises soft spots on wrinkles you can store them at room temperature for a couple days before the skin dries up or slow them loose in the fridge for up to two weeks you the red blush and the growing condition affect how deep a flesh color is this one here has no red blush but has a deeper flesh color than this one that has a web blush only in the flesh is edible let's have a taste the flesh tastes very juicy it has this sweet and tart flavor it does taste different from a regular navel orange this one is also has a sweet and tart flavor the flesh is

pretty easily but one of the best ones is a carrot for whatever reason the flesh of a carrot is really perfect for bold piece material and what we're gonna make today is a carrot chilling when you're selecting a carrot you want to make sure that it's decently thick and that you can yeah I mean actually that's the only consideration so the first step is I'm gonna take this little paring knife and just cut off the end and the bold piece is gonna go on this end and in fact I'm gonna just gonna mark that right now by putting my knife right in the middle there and starting to just drill a little bit of a hole there and then we're gonna cut it to about where we want to hit it from let's say right there so let's just cut that off and what we want to do is create another mark right there this is our mouth piece we're gonna Whittle it down a little bit more so that's something that fits a little better on your mouth and what I'm gonna do is take this bamboo skewer and I'm gonna stick it into one end of the carrot and I'm gonna drill all the way through and out the other end just hammer this guy down a little bit just push it in and it pulls all the way through and we've got our bolt beast drilled in right there what I'm gonna do now is whittle down this end just a little bit and that way it's gonna fit a little nicer here we go you can like carve your initials into it like in a tree

going on guys keep calm back with another video and in this one i am excited i haven't seen anything like this in my dispensary and it's pretty much a chillum pre-packed with 0.3 this is some berry air it's only testing out at fifteen point four nine percent fifteen point six percent but it's looking pretty good i'm excited to bust this open go ahead and crack open this seal how are you guys doing today hope you guys are having a good day so we open up comes in this tube all right first thing i notice this comes off the sticker and there's weed all on it but uh all right [Music] let's go ahead and unscrew this i guess that's how you're supposed to do it all right i'm not getting really too much of a smell so let me know these guys are smoking on down below and uh go ahead and give this a taste test [Music] cheers [Music] okay it's pretty smooth i like how the smoke stays in there it's not just pouring out like it should or it usually does normal ones um and one thing i forgot to mention these are 0.3 and the chillms these retail at 10 so it's one of those price points to where it's like it's not that bad to throw out ten dollars if it doesn't work out you know but at the end you do get to chill them glass chill it's not super thick but it's definitely not you know china glass so that's good we'll go ahead and rip this again yeah i mean it it's smooth it doesn't have too much taste it almost has like a berry a fruity berry like almost like a wild berry type of how that berry very matter of fact it's almost more like a blue dream how has that blueberry [Music] i would say blueberry with the with the hint of hazy [Music] yeah it's not too bad you know if you're on the run you're having a walk you're on the drive anything like that i feel like it uh definitely

we're going to do hookah with grape football without using any foil we're going to be using a lot Lotus on top again we didn't make very much nanda and grapefruit on great football okay let's do it and cut the top a little bit this measure it's all over all over that grapefruit white so he cut the bottom part from great food so to make it stable on top of the hookah just a little bit so you won't get any juice or anything Oh [Music] the bowling side I also made a hole to the bottom using that thing so you can get it anywhere I thought you paid to watch it a little bit inside so if I won't get them I juice at the beginning so in using toothpicks pretty much you're going to make the bottom where you're going to put this tobacco so it won't pull this out of the hole just three is is that going to be enough yeah so it's going to be enough to hold it to bucket for me so it pretty much you have to sweat you have to just use the back which one so where you wet so you're up to like dry dried tobacco pretty much you can put it what I was inside of a pack always if you use the mix adding some mint just make sure you add pretty much very first sign of mint join you and it makes this you use because otherwise mint is going to kill the rest of the flavor just to make sure make a little hole inside that of the bowl so the air can go through the bottom bottom and the top okay so we've now setting up except who could just make sure it's so thin still not moving anywhere and right now we're within circles and we're going to also warm up the color a little bit start giving the smoke more faster like a couple of minutes so sometimes sometimes we use the screws around so the top clout won't fall anywhere but we're not using anymore because we found out that pretty much the cloud when getting up which is getting attached to the the grapefruit so it won't go anywhere so you can just put it on top and wait a couple minutes so it's going to warm up the hole to bog the whole bowl and then I'm going to start small after you wait three minutes so I got warm we can take out one charcoal so we'll it to inside just close this up let's try [Music] yeah good to go don't forget

today", "VjsJCbDwPKI": "[Music] so what's the objective today we have ourselves a double helix chillin and that's it right there it seems pretty straightforward everybody primarily I guess knows what a Chilam is I think of a challenge is something a real simple smoking device that you would just put between your fingers and smoke like this and I mean that's my belief and that and it's pretty basic it's there's not there's not much to it other than that and until I met TK I didn't I had no idea the intricacies and the details and you know the thicknesses and whole philosophies and ideals behind the Chilam except we're grinding up the yeah I just ruined I just ground up a little piece of the Kim 91 and Sour Diesel oh nice twenty point eight six percent THC yeah very low on the CBD got a CBD heavy strain we're in Oregon so we just walk down the street and there's dispensaries all around we can you can pretty much turn to Amsterdam yeah you can pretty much trip over them here yeah pretty pretty much six gram limit per visit first perk for day per store and I buy grams at a time so I go to and get seven flavors and every place I visit so for recreational weekend you can do up to how much at one time up to seven grams per store per day so you know you can get a lot if you hit up a lot of different stores but we're trying to buy big amounts you know obviously the biggest and once you can find a time as a quarter so you can get a quarter of a single thing from a place or you know two eighths or seven you know individual grams can't you just go to different stores though yeah absolutely go to the for sure hmm or go back to the same one you know day after day I mean you're looking at pain anywhere from seven or eight at the low end up to 13 14 15 grams dollars a gram at the high okay so I just loaded helix not cleanest at the moment very very thick and heavy glass very well made hand-blown bought from a head shop in Dallas Texas that has a very very very amazing stuff as you can see the double helix and lookit you know and that is a point oh seven grand Bowl so very very very small amount so if you're getting you know Graham from a place for you know say ten bucks yeah you know you're looking at about fifteen fourteen fifteen helix bowls and for a lightweight this is more than enough I mean you and I share this only that's plenty that's plenty we're about to go throw some discs after this at the park little disc action and this is more than enough for that so so why helix I mean I mean I think the whole purpose of me asking you is because I was fascinated by your passion and your understanding behind it and that's that's what I think well there for people to know you know at most shops that you'll go do to buy glass it's thin glass more import glass almost all import glass is the thin style of glass and anyone who knows anything about smoking will know what I'm talking about and I don't know if you can tell but helix is like solid glass through it's very very thick yeah very very heavy I have personally never seen this kind of work at least for this kind of piece Brian war so often time do you drop a piece it breaks because of the thinness of the glass but he looks has been dropped many many times even on concrete and never never broken it has a very small chip at the mouth and but besides that it survived the last five years Wow Wow yeah this is extremely thick and it's helix it's because the artwork in it is that what it is well the heat I mean helix is the style of fuming and it's inside out fuming so the way it's made or the way the actual the smoke funnels when it's lilt has nothing to do it and has nothing to do with that I think you smoke nope it's just it's just the style of fuming that they did for coloring it is created a it's a it's a helix tile pattern mm it could have done you know whatever pattern they wanted and they did a spiral yeah I like it and it's got the knobby which I think it's pretty common yeah and then it has these like divot so I guess you can yep the again yep then yeah the nub keeps it from rolling off of a table or roll it off of a surface right and then the teeth marks allow you to hold it if you learn I hate it like all right without having you know if you're driving or you know whatever you also wanted to cover grinding because very few people grind you don't get an even burn when you don't grind also you have trouble getting it all or having to hit it more times than you ought to and then you're just you know smoking extra you know butane right from the lighter whereas if you grind it you get a very even clean burn also a trickle burn also less of it trails off as you're smoking and you have less waste less runoff less hot box effect that makes more into the lungs more more more more more effective smoking and also much easier to clean out you can blow it out very easily once it's turned to ash whereas if it's in clumps I mean even the other day I forgot my grinder at home and I was just breaking up in my hand but it's still not the same right and it didn't hit the same right so you don't want to just throw it in there can I see that grinder yes absolutely that's awesome it's just fascinating to me and that's what that's what they call a four piece grinder so that's a key shredder most expensive grinder on the market pretty much you know what what I found interesting about this was oh like this oh yeah as when you grind it it gets what is it Keefe yep all the THC trichomes that are on the bud that fall off in the process of grinding fall through the screen and then go down into the bottom into the key compartment we look at them track homes that's all Keith having a deliciously add that to a bowl and spike it by despite your ball not against it but it can be intense because I mean for me I have a hundred varieties in my collection yeah and so there's a lot of varieties contained down in the bottom of this little guy no that's why that's really that's like you could call that your Long Island iced tea of smoking and cocktail of everything it's nice it's fancy it's very fancy I'm excited shall we demonstrate is he smoking oh you're gonna let me take green so absolute little all right that's very that's very generous [Music] sun's out it's been Portland foam very excited behind here in Portland [Music] see very little runoff I mean our and if you noticed I didn't even have a lighter it was already still burning from Bruce's head let spank me yeah yeah and we've we've barely gotten into it I had an entire bowl of this I'm on my way home this morning oh yeah yeah it was great now this is a good one there so this is a sativa that's the other thing a lot of people don't understand the differences between sativa indica sativa is mental hi Ryan mentally stimulating once often times can make you want to get stuff done so I've been cleaning up my room sweeping and rearranging I talked to you about actually getting one of these and you're like this is the one I can't believe how inexpensive it is awesome right right and but you don't even know where to get it here I mean I got it from retro Revolution in Dallas Texas that's a shop it's a shop they have clothing and apparel and accessories and insane retro retro revolution I was working a website - how's work I don't know I won the State Fair and this girl had these cool gauge earrings and I said where'd you get those shoes I got him at my work I've retro revolution so I went there and they had some of the most amazing glass art I've ever seen that's what brought you in I mean well I mean the earrings robbed me and actually need to bind a lot of get earrings from them hmm but I mean but they also had a section half of their if you have digital so I do alright first straight to a four and I'm up - I've been to a two so I have everything from two four six eight and twelve I have like a different earrings and Veitch size really sometimes they only have one now but so you've found that to be a great shop it's the best headshot that I've ever been to evolution in Dallas Texas I'd love to go back but this particular glassblower an entire shelf dedicated to his work and he had a whole bunch of ones that ass come through yep yep yep so that's the end of the bowl you can actually even see through it it's done it's good for about three or four hits for a burro for like a medium casual smoker for some you know heavy hitters maybe just a couple or for some light weights and you saw that one hit drop me drop me oh yeah or you get a one hitter that's a point usually a round of 0.05 grand balls right go by a gram for twenty four ten bucks you're looking at 20 bowls of that and if you're a lightweight and you know that'll have your sets where you know come Lauer's anyway what is it again how so by what a one-hitter right and it's got a hundredth of a gram scale yeah and then get a grinder get a grinder yeah for sure and I think it'll get a little chilling that's a small bowl I mean even it's bigger point 1/2 grams considerably bigger than this and grinding up you know 0.12 grams at a time is a lot so I recommend shooting for 0.05 0.07 ramble which is very small for fur starters yeah I think what I really like is because I've definitely always had a different viewpoint on Jones I've always just thought get keeps bud throw it in there a bit in there about most people do I'm Malou I'm just doing and I never even considered myself to be you know just to care enough about like it like a fine wine that you you've made it sound where I described it and actually it is I mean it's kind of interesting when you do go into dispensaries and you smell like like OG and then you nope and or all these different strains they have a very distinct smell to them oh sure what is it dog it smell like oh yeah I think smoking it tastes like dog a like just dog hair or wet dog or something it's yeah disgusting yeah for sure whatnot mm-hmm which if you're knew nothing about positive things you know can make for an intense experience but yeah like I said just you know treat it like a pharmaceutical where you just got a great medication and so that's why if you can go into a place you know get a variety you know get seven if I tell them specifically tell the people at the shop what what you're there for what are you there for depression either for anxiety there for physical pain are you there you need something to wake you up in the morning do you want something that makes you talkative wake up in the morning there are ones you know that are that are helpful for that but really be functional though if you smoke in the morning some people yes I have met people who are but they look like I said you have you smoking the right stuff if you're not talking the right stuff then it's a vineyard then you're gonna you know who then it's uh even you don't know what's gonna happen you know what I mean and so it's like you got a trying medication you know if you like it yeah you got a right on it what is this good for is it's good for lazy nabo is it good for sleeping is it good for getting the dishes done is it good for you know taking the trash out you know is it good for taking a nap you know whatever you need help with like that's what having a medication for and if you like it so much that you use it all the time and you need more well good thing you know the place down the street has you know more of it and ability and Mitch's everything like multitasking you know totally gives your body and your mind I got something like forty something kills way more double what I normally get I was just like on fire more so I was a lot more I was making more like cognitive functions per minute you know and being able to correspondingly you know control you know my unit you know my champion in that game I think you're in a flow state right exactly that's otherwise right and so I mean so it's a bit of actually challenging yeah enjoyment yeah but I put I mean but also it's really like you said where is your mind is your mind I've taken a nap you're right dad rocking at the booty game is your mind [Music]", "CSaz1dXgG0E": "the number one pick and shovel play in the marijuana sector stay tuned you really don't want to miss this one hi guys in today's video i want to go over a company that we went over before but i'm heavily bullish on this company i want you guys really to take notice of this company maybe you're not you're not familiar with the marijuana industry um maybe you are but this company here i feel like it's the best pick and shovel play for this industry and i'm gonna break it down for you and i'm gonna tell you why within this video very important you stay to the end because i feel like this video at this price range where this stock is at right now can really can really benefit you guys in terms of making some profits long term okay everybody focuses on when the marijuana sector everybody focuses in on companies that are producing that are producers right we have companies like tilray we have companies like sndl we have all kinds of different companies well within those companies there's gonna be a lot a lot of competition okay so that means the market share for each company is getting reduced and as time goes by there's gonna be more and more companies more and more competition right so i'm gonna i'm gonna describe this company too i'm gonna go over it real quick we already did a video before if you didn't if you missed that video click here and you'll be able to see that video okay so the name of the company that we're speaking about is silver spike acquisition which is a spec but they're merging with weed maps weed maps okay guys um currently trading at 1964 which for me presents a huge buying opportunity this stock has ran up all the way to about 30 okay high 20s currently we do have 300 shares on this stock now i was invested in when i made that video i think we got in like around 12 bucks we ran it all the way up guys okay i cashed out i i was selling along the way because i had a lot of shares then i went and got opportunities with these facts you got to know that you got to get rid of some of your shares along the way because they do run up all the way and they do come down we've seen them come down however within the last couple of weeks you've seen that this company silver spike acquisition weed maps has really held its ground compared to many other um spacks okay so this company here i think i think has a great potential and i'm gonna break it down for you okay currently invested uh 300 shares at an at an average cost of 2091 i want to get that average below 20 and i want to build up anywhere from 500 to 700 shares and this is gonna be the perfect time to do it guys okay um let me let me get into something real quick for those that don't know weed maps is a online advertising platform for mj okay guys it's an online advertising platform now they're not just an online advertising platform they're the number one online advertisement platform okay in the whole us so just think about that their competition is very minimal the next big competition i think is ease but they have no type of market share like what weed maps does now i want to show you if you're not familiar with weed maps i want to show you there when you when you go on the website you usually get this this image here which is a map of where you're located and it tells you uh every pin that you see here on the screen is basically a pin of a certain company that pays weed maps to advertise on their platform guys to advertise on their platform so every single pin you see here in the la area every single pin is paying an advertisement fee now that advertisement fee can range from 500 all the way up to five to ten thousand dollars depending on how much advertisement this company has now if you multiply that within all these these pins you see here you're gonna you're gonna see that it's a lot of money guys a lot of money so that in turn will continue to grow within the next couple of years as weed becomes legalized in other states okay so in my opinion this company is just getting started but just to give you a little bit of history on the revenue and the revenue growth i'm going to step in this um this chart here which is which is an amazing um chart that shows you and breaks you down everything okay there's um i'm going to read off a little bit of information so you can get a little bit of more information okay cannabis advertisement advertising giant weed maps hopes to boost its revenues over the next three years by a whopping 175 okay and investors are wagering the california based company can deliver on that goal guys i mentioned before in my other video that i have been involved in this sector for quite some time and this company here is the number one company guys don't sleep on this company it's the number one company and you guys will see within the next couple of years that this price that you're seeing right now at 19 will blow up okay i'm just giving you this advice i'm connecting the dots for you i've already been involved here i know this company i know people that work at this company it's a very solid company okay and their ceo is great too let me read this off to you the stock which trades under sspk on the nasdaq climbed another 22 after the company filed a form ss4 with the u.s securities exchange commission that includes the audited financials and more details about the deal and the company operations okay this is important in weed maps investors see a profitable high margin fast growing and tech and software business that happens to be tied to the cannabis sales but one that does not touch the plan why is that important i'll tell you why that's important not touching the plant allows the company to enjoy higher trading volume on the nasdaq be owned by the traditional investment institutions and avoid irs section 280e to pay typical business tax rates you get that guys so what does that mean that means they don't touch the plan therefore big institutions can go ahead and load the boat on these guys and not fear that you know what one day you know if if anything happens in the future with the laws and stuff like that they won't be influenced with that okay that's very important now this is the most eye-catching information for me and i want to pass it on to you okay we're going to go over revenue growth from 2015 which was before cannabis was even legalized as as anybody can use it right recreation or anybody can use it okay back in 2015 their revenue was 43 2016 61 million 2017 90 2018 we got jumped to 101 2019 now we're getting more closer to the recreational 144 guys that's a 43 year overgrowth okay 2020 160 okay and in 2021 they're estimated to go from 160 all the way to 205 but look at these numbers guys 2022 as more states become legalized as more states open up to this and i'll tell you what because of the situation we're in with the coven i'll tell you what more states are gonna be open we just heard new jersey new york they're open for this okay why they want to generate tax they want to generate income okay so they're going to be open to this sector now we see 20 22 300 million estimated and in 2023 we're going to 440 40 million dollars guys this company at this current price you're getting an awesome opportunity to jump in in this sector if you're not involved yet i would suggest and this is not financial advice that this is a wonderful picks and shovels play because why the competition is minimal the sector's competition when we're talking about mj we're talking about competition within a bunch of companies they got a lot of competition okay a lot of growers out there a lot of sellers out there but weed maps comes at you from a different perspective and they're collecting money from all the competition their platform offers advertisement for the producers for the big companies like stizzy okay and people buying it okay so if you look at it you're saying wow you got an opportunity to own this company at this price very reduced right now and it has great uptrend okay that's just my opinion guys with that i wanted to conclude the video i just want to give you an update on this company i think it's an awesome opportunity to buy right now um if you found any of this information informative please like and subscribe also hit the notification bell that way you get all the videos when they just come out okay also if you haven't followed us yet follow us at twitter investing og on twitter okay guys with that guys you have yourself a wonderful day god bless

fruit bowl doesn't provide a particular flavor But its really easy to be done if you know the right way Which i am about to show you today In general we choose hard apples I recommend the Granny Smith green apples Let me show you how to make it First of all we need our cut to be on the top of the apple and not in the middle Lets start.. We cut the apple from top and we try to keep a straight line cut Next, to create the cavity we use this tool which basically its an ice-cream scoop I've watched many people using knives or scoops and i guarantee that this tool will make a perfect job We start, having in mind to create a cavity which has a diameter of 7-7.5 cm like the diameter of the most HMD's We make our main cavity and next we try to open its diameter a bit more Our cavity needs to be like this You can also eat the apple!! Moving forward... We use the apple knife to drill a hole until the bottom of our apple we need to be careful on this part to drill a straight hole which is necessary for us because it will keep our apple straight on our hookah Moving on now... to contain the tobacco in our apple bowl we are going to use toothpicks some people use a metal-net I will suggest the toothpicks because the metal-nets sometimes contain magnesium which is bad for your health We use our toothpicks because we want to create a barrier inside the apple between the cavity and the hookah's port so the tobacco will stay above the barrier The apple as a bowl, doesn't provide a particular flavor in our session and for that reason there are no restrictions on the tobacco flavors we like to use today I am going to use ''Mazaya four seasons'' and ''Al Fakher blueberry'' Depending on the tobacco brand we use We can chop our tobacco if the leaves are big and thick or use it as it is today i am going to chop the tobacco The tobacco quantity we use depends on the time we want our session to last We need to place our toothpicks on the bottom of our cavity to protect them from getting burned We fluff pack the tobacco in our apple head to ensure we have a nice airflow Depending on the heat management you like to use If you are using ''Kaloud Lotus'' like me try to leave 0.5 cm space from the apple's lip Our pack will look like this Depending on what airflow types you prefer on your pull you can leave it like that or use your finger or a toothpick to open a hole in the middle Our apple is ready on our hookah what remains now its the heat management and the coals, which I've prepared We place our HMD on the apple head a HMD like ''Kaloud Lotus'' needs several minutes before its ready to smoke if you use something different like ''Kaya Block'' which you can pre-heat it will help you to start faster your session Our hookah is now ready to smoke the longevity of our session depends on the quantity of the tobacco we used Whatever questions you may have you are welcome to add them as comments and i will answer them Don't forget to Subscribe You can also suggest to us whatever you'd like to see on our next episodes and...

first one it's just a piece of 12 mil tube yes a 12 mil tube is the same as the blow tube that we normally use so I'm just making a round bottom just a really small round bottom and then going to attach a punny to that making sure it's nice and even as you pull off there and you're going to do a nice hot seal punty here as you shape up making your plane a little bit more precise so you can just heat the very end of that round bottom not to form it as you seal up they're just going to make that connection and then I'm going to go in for a convention so I'm heating that up kind of like I would from Maria but I'm letting the glass fall in on itself and the walls thick enough and maybe pushing slightly just a little that makes sure that your exterior wall diameter stays nice and even as that glass condenses in rolling on your marver to make sure it stays completely parallel if you have an El Marva oh it's a great great time to use it and you can see there that the walls where you did the convention have really closed down restricting that airflow so now we're just heating up the other side and it's going to be kind of similar to making that convention but it's a hollow Maria so I'm just going to heat it up and below kind of a little bit as I push it together and then you use your V blade to condensed down and that's where you will break it off for the mouthpiece later on so now we're just coming to condensing it to the right size and I'm going to remove my punny now that all the work is done and you'll be opening the front here and you know that'll become the bowl of the one-e-and so just heat it up and use one blade of the jacks and flare that open turn your flame up a little bit to heat more of the bowl there go in with one blade again I'm getting it to parallel maybe going a little bit past now I'm going in with my one blade you can see the beeswax burning off of there and it's really important to put beeswax on your jacks when you use them it'll create a smoother gliding along the glass finishing it off with a little two bladed flare and work out any tool marks and they're going to heat it up a little bit before you do some fuming with some silver so now I'm going to grab my silver and I know that we've talked about a few minute basically we're just heating up the silver and it's vaporizing on to the glass bring a nice even coat on there then heating it up a little bit to bake it in with a nice very reducing flame and now I'm just going to put on a few dots and let them melt in so put one on heat it up a little bit and you want to be careful not to melt them too much so you to form the shape or that the you guys burn off the silver now you're going to take your diamond sheers heat up that little area and then cool it down and with a quick tap the one you will pop right off just go into your flame and polish that end off and I'm gonna use my octagonal flaring tool to open that up and there you go that's the first onee that's for you guys you can see that few month a those dots nice colors from the silver with that black background yeah so we're going to make another one now and it's really similar to the last one that we made so we're going to start the same way just with a twelve millimeter blow to remain upon T but rather than just fuming this one you're going to do a little bit of inside-out work on the bowl area so you're going to start by heating up a little more area and flaring it out some gradual steps you can get that inside out technique just playing it open I got two blades there now and jacks are angled downwards to help open that flare up and you're going to grab your gold and do a little bit of gold fuming first using a more oxidizing flame with your gold just getting a thin layer gold on there and then I'm going to try to add some dots little dots that'll kind of implode and make a really cool effect adding just a little heat there being careful not to burn off the gold comes off a little bit easier the silver does and now you're going in to add some dots pull out on your rail always nice to be able to have a little more leeway with your elbow and the other end of the tube yeah the rail is great and you guys can grab that from the blast shield I just tell Tyra that you saw it in the video putting on dots on the inside of the flare there just remember and pattern so now I'm going to go in with the silver and create another layer of fume helps hold it on add some different colors in there now I'm going to go in with my three millimeter rod I just put on some dots in between the gold dots and that's going to give the two different effects in the two different colors kind of just putting them on randomly in there filling in the pattern once you've got all your dots on there you're going to go back in turn your flame up a little bit and start to condense it down heat it up a little bit and then going to marver it out and condense that back down putting heat in there gradually bringing it back to Center bring it back down to the same size as your blow-tube and you're going to close up the end trying to save as many dots as possible heat it up and condensing that back praying it to a really nice termination and I'm trying to leave as many of my dots in there as I can so that the work I do will show heating it up letting it condense and you're going to put some air in there blowing out the walls yeah heated it up and boiling it out a little bit and condensing it back down and that's gonna add depth and muff in the bubbles all the way melt in the clear dots all the way make sure it's nice and even as you work they're rolling back on your marver to help bring it bring the walls in I've heated it up a little bit and now I'm going to be able to attach my punty and condense the ball a little bit so that we have the smaller hole going in for your hot seal on the end there make sure you heat just the end of your fume bubble and now you're going to go in with that nice precise flame and make a convention just heating it up and kind of letting the walls collapse in on himself a little bit and I'm going to condense that hole to about one and a half maybe two millimeters and then you're going to go in and make the mouthpiece Maria just using that same precise flame pushing together with a little puff as you heat up yeah just expanding that a little bit you can see it's I'm holding the air in there a little bit pushing a little bit and that creates that nice mouthpiece once it cools you're going to heat up just next to it and use your V blade to condense down where you taking it off later making sure to go in gradually not just pressing too hard because you can get your whole off center so I'm going to remove my bunny and then I'm going to heat that tip up a little bit and blow out the hole for the very center pulling a little bit to make sure the termination is centered and to thin out the glass on the end to make it easy to blow through opening it up and then you're going to use your jacks to flare it into a bowl and then we're using the back of the jacks Azzam as a pad to even off the wall and now I'm firing it open to the nice taper for the money ball doing it gradually there you can see you have a bit of a gradient heat from the back to the very edge of the bowls it has to move a little bit more flaring there and I love the way those dots look when they're hot in there so cool yeah definitely it's definitely real treat to see what the glass looks like when it's hot now you're going to go and put some silver fume on the rest of the body here using that reducing flame and that all color in really nicely when when it gets smoked out of I don't get blues and reds and purples greens faking it in there is a very reducing flame lots of propane in there and now you're going to add a few dots to the outside just going around the edge doing a little spiral and then make sure when you melt these in that you don't cook off any of your silver fuming or melt in the dots so that it deforms the glass at all working your way around one at a time heating it up letting it cool and then go into the next one so I'm going to show you guys another way how to detach the onee because I know you guys all use different tools so this time I'm going to heat up and pull a small thin piece out of the end and then I'll be able to break that off and make it Hollow and you're using your fancy one you just got from Italy but you can get a similar tool from blast shield or mountain glass yeah I think round glass probably had some holders like that and super starting at this one from Italy from Rana that thin cone just snaps right off to a nice hole heat it up just a little bit open up the hole and there you go making sure it's nice and even you're going to start the opening with your jacks and then finish it with your rear just you know you can use whatever you guys have take it off there of course that's for you guys just comment on the video check out review hourglass gallery and show us your monies pop that in the kiln and of course you got to stay hydrated when you're on the torch for a long time yep for sure you guys definitely drink some water it's really important so that the next one that we're going to do is a fully worked inside out 1e and this one's a little bit like a spoon but a lot of you guys have asked for this for a long time so I want to make two blanks so I have a twelve millimeter blow tube connected to 26 millimeter tubing and I'm going to cut that in half and you'll set one of those aside you can use it later or you know make another one if you're doing a bunch of production yep so now I'm just going to heat it up and start to kind of pre shape the flare that I'm going to do and you're going to open this one up into a little bit bigger of an inside-out flare so you can do a lot of nice work on the inside a couple different kinds of fuming so just take the jacks and the lip is just a little bit hotter than the rest of the piece you see the beeswax burning and then put in some more beeswax make sure it's nice and fluid as you rotate helps you get that nice even flare heating it up and flaring it open all the way rotating a little bit in each direction as you flare help it stay nice and even and finishing in one direction so now I'm going to go in with some gold and put on that first layer of fume so oxidizing flame going in with the gold and you can always take the time to adjust your flame so if you see that it could be a little bit better just take the time to go adjust it you'd see the gold really coming off on the inside there making that nice even layer moving it around so it coats all over the inside now you need to add your first dots so pull that torch out a little bit and go in with a three millimeter just kind of put them on randomly leave enough space for your next dots which are going to be on the silver moving around kind of randomly but evenly filling in and now I'm going to reheat it a little bit since those dots have put stress all over the glass and use some silver so now just fuming with the silver over the gold and over the dots that I just put in and then I'll be able to add some dots of silver that'll give you a really cool pattern in the fume they're two different colors pulling out so you can get that better angle off to the side yeah it's good to adjust your torch and take the time to like get yourself set up in exactly the right position your will definitely come out better making sure it's nice and evenly filled in there and there you're going to go in and reheat and start to condense it down so I'm heating it up and condensing it down going to roll on my marver make sure it stays as even as you can as you bring it back down to a blank size heating a little bit more at the front since once again it needs to move more than the back and then I'll also keep it steady on your blow-tube so now I'm going to pull the side out a little bit because you can see that it was a little uneven and once I have that pretty square I'll heat it up and condense it down to make a round bottom pulling it out right into the center there closing it up so you can start to condense it right down into that nice blank try to save as much your work as possible rolling on your marver putting a little air in to even out the walls and now you're going to hook up your blow-tube and punty up so I'm heating it up and going to condense this down a little bit like we did with the spoon but it's smaller and we're going to make the bowl on the end so just heat it up you can twist a little bit if you want to add in a cool effect and kind of let it condense and those dots that you put on will kind of come to come up into the glass and look like little bubble almost kind of 3d you know implosion almost effect going on pulling a little bit as it's hot therefore that shaping and now you're going to go in and condense like a nice big thick Maria on the mouth yeah so you want that Maria to be thick like Kevin said because you want that 3d effect for the fuming that you put in on the inside walls now just like the other ones you're heating just past that mouthpiece Maria and condensing with your feet blade now I'm going to take off my Ponte and this is going to be similar to the spoon so what we're going to do is blow a very small up bubble smaller than we would for like a head of a spoon so just going to heat it up a little bit but you can see I'm expanding it getting it nice and hot floppy on your blow-tube you'll let it condense back for a second and then put some air in to make it a nice even bubble you just pull out a little bit of the end and you can bring that hole all the way to the end and also makes a nice centered termination there makes sure your pattern comes right to your bowl hole in the center there and now I'm going to get that ready to push my ball find a little bit with the back of the jacks like a paddle and use a reamer if you want to adjust the size then you're going to push in with your bowl push as you rotate pushing right on axis there you can see that kind of looks like a little pipe but um or chill them but see another way to make a one E and now you're going to put some dots around the side they're similar to the other ones since this one's a little bit thicker you can put out a little bit bigger dots a little bit harder to deform this one yeah absolutely and adding the dots on this adds another layer of magnification so you can kind of choose where you want to put them if you want something to look bigger you know distorted evening out the heat and then you're going to go in and heat that convention area and cool it off with your diamond Cheers a little tap and it'll pop right off yeah I'd love to take the pieces off this way I feel like it's really precise if you want to adjust the size of your hole at all you can grab a piece of three mil kind of get it around a little bit and then use your reamer to open that up and make it an even hole using your jacks at first it's a real little there and then flaring with your reamer and of course that one's for you guys too you can see those really nice dots in there in that little bit of a spiral pattern yeah definitely comment on the video let us know what you're up to if you have any Chin's will totally answer them there you can see the three different ones first one the third one and then that second one in the back there yeah they're all going to change color um when you guys use them because the silver creates patterns and different things that will come out when there's a dark background behind them you can see there's that second one the silver right there a little it's just yellow right now and then the gold and silver those different color dots up front it looks like a honeycomb pattern from the inside there yeah kind of and then what's really cool is on this one where you get to see the the magnification over the bubbles and I don't know I think straight inside out looks really cool you guys should show me that I'm show Kevin them put them in the reviewer glass gallery and we'll totally take a look and even this little simple one here will look really awesome once it's used fills in with all those colors and super quick to make yeah it's great practice for you guys just starting out and it's a good item for sure hey guys welcome back thanks for watching and checking out these 1yz I hope that you guys get something out of it learn a trick or two maybe some of you guys can use in your own work this is them yeah they'll say this is an awesome thing to just practice a lot of really give those good techniques down really perfected I mean all the techniques that we use are right here and those one easier is dotting everything so it's just great way to build your skill set and of course you could do all kinds of other work on the one each of you do color work you can think about a line tubing you know practice on other techniques these are just some different shaping techniques and a couple of color techniques but yeah you guys could go Bob with the post-it in Revere glass gallery and will totally look at it and check it out absolutely so I had some questions for you Destin sure first up from a salika glass who'd you like to know he's starting out how do you price your work but he's really just starting to work the on glass full-time I mean that's the question that's a pretty pretty big question great how do you price your work well I mean I think ultimately it's what the market demands you know so it depends where you are and how much demand is in your work but um you know I would say if you just started out you know try to cover the cost of your the glass that is made with great you know the supplies that you use to make it so that it has you work more full-time you know you have to take into consideration the time you put into each piece lengths like that yeah I mean as you get better they'll be people who know about your work and know know where they contact you and you'll be able to you know sell it for Kotori marketing is a huge part of our glass industry now having that online presence is you know undeniably a big part of having a following or in a lot of places yeah I mean we just got an email last week about somebody who's in a school studying blast porn and heart and yes for a resume yes do we look at resumes and the answer is no we look at Instagram so if you want to if you want to put your work up put it up on Instagram and start building your gallery and you'll increase your sales absolutely next up a lot of people were asking you know what other gemstones could you in case because these are borojevic carved out of a piece of aura right you know could you do like an emerald maybe or something like that there's a lot of that up for experimentation um maybe some cubic zirconium could work to tektite multiply will definitely work zinc guy but you guys should test them out and I think that we talked about this in an earlier video great but if you find any gemstones that work write them down in the comments and we'd love to share that with people and let them know what you know what works absolutely yeah I think maybe like higher end synthetic ones maybe I think might have a better chances of working if you're going experiment has opposed to natural things with moisture yeah one thing is created under heat and pressure will probably things without moisture in it you know I don't know do it a shot Erica Southworth would like to know so you know desta we sent out some collab pieces a while ago have we ever gotten anything back no we guys we haven't ever gotten anything back I wish we had some pictures to show you Erica of some cloud pieces we have this collab piece it was given to us from some students yeah we really love this piece he I mean he he went of his own accord and purchased those Marinis and and made some colored tubing to match and then send it back and it's so awesome to do glass if you guys are watching and you have some of our cloud pieces it's cool man you know it's sometimes things take time we know but we love to get of it you know show the audience you know what was make people want to see it wouldn't IRA just to do some more on the torch glass absolutely and Erica also asked you know about online classes if you have kind of specific questions about that totally shoot them over to info or beer glass calm or Kevin our viewer glass talk honestly and for online classes if I get maybe six people together will run one so if you know some other people who want one totally get together and shoot an email over all right well cool guys thanks for watching we appreciate Oh giveaway giveaway and we also have a new piece on the table that's true we do we didn't even talk about these these are the other your gloves yeah but you guys saw some footage of that and here's a couple the other ones so I mean help DePalma stoked we have to give away these rings that Fichman glass made last week these are awesome you guys don't even know how many rings we got to see last time and how many people love the idea so we want to really thank fish man glass for coming out and sharing these with you guys and if you don't get one of these and like just you know maybe get one totally hit him up on this email pitchman glass at gmail.com on Facebook and check out for the diagram Instagram Instagram as well of course can't forget that so the first one is going to see two hair H er are all right that's for you and who's this we're going to go to that one is going to Kyle Skinner alright you guys thank you guys for watching your continued support it means everything we'll see you guys soon with another on the torch and a update about the leaves in Italy absolutely bye guys okay", "aS8SJVRdQ0k": "Wow welcome back fellow youtubers fellow subscribers fill a medicator z-- fellow fellows I got a little stumble up there because I'm I'm real excited about this product um I don't I don't often oops I don't often do these kinds of reviews but I'm gonna start with a disclaimer this is a legal smoking product I will be using 100% legally organically grown hemp in this product this video is for anyone over the age of 21 if you're not 21 there's the door get to steppin the reason why I'm excited about this pocket seen anything like this this is like icing this and I had to get one um it's in here lots of bubble paper Nike knife bubble paper is crazy but this is this is made by a company called Jack the Ripper's scientific inhalations that's what it's called scientific inhalations and it's me by its called Jack the Ripper Jack the Ripper alright by scientific inhalations um i don't think there's any other kind of like website info or anything like that oh yeah there is so i'll make sure i post all that info and a little bit of like flavor text yeah so basically this is what it is so this end here when you put your mouth that's a little clip it comes off and then this mouthpiece here comes off and it leaves this empty could you imagine why it wouldn't want to be emptied anyone I'm fine anyone I know ideas you way in the back then no it's not saying you can stash your stuff in there okay Hume in the back here silly you don't put your shoe here you put it in here okay the reason why this is empty and hollow inside turn this whole back is because we're gonna fill this up but this anybody know what this is way in the back no you wrong what this is is coconut toasted like it's like a chuckle basically and this whoo sorry guys it's late here in PA this is organic cotton I'm gonna show you what we're gonna do with these so let's point this down here a little piece right here to fill this sucker up now I got this from Planet roll-your-own PPP plane it Ryo planet Ryo I don't know if you guys have that kind of thing in your area you know I don't think you do I don't think there will be I think there's any like two or three stores here and this is it there's like they're not anywhere else and uh a guy that I talked to a lot in there his name is Tony tony from Planet Ryo I'll leave the information for them as well in the description he was showing me this and I just couldn't help it's bizarre it's weird it's cool and I like it so I bought it so we got the charcoal in there like this this yeah palm now he said there should be enough in here for a couple fills and I do have some mother that's probably a little too much I do have some other coconut charcoal from a different type of product I got it's sort of like this product so let it be known that uh if I do need more charcoal I do have it somewhere and I'm sure the store that I got this from will end up carrying more charcoal because they carry these products so then it makes sense to me that they would alright so here we go says to fill in about 80% now it seems about eighty percent to me about you hmm many percent karna back yeah okay so now we're gonna take say half this me yeah no us gonna I guess stuffing with this righto ramming that they give you oh maybe that's a little too tight let's try more like this I've seen as far - it was so difficult hmm well we're learning together here folks let's try it like this there we go that seems a little better I think that very ah there we go there we go yeah I'll just take these little pieces here and put them in there yeah yeah there we go that seems pretty cool and then says you're supposed to after you get this done like this put the mouthpiece back on and put the clip back so tastes kind of like he's kind of like coconut it's really hard to draw I don't believe it should be that on a draw so maybe that's what this end here with the pokey puller is about you take this extra out of here I'm still pretty still pretty heartless to get it to draw maybe I'll fluff it up some maybe that'll help that's a little better a little better all right so let's give this a whirl guys so this is the nd pack obviously yeah yeah it's not a bit so let's get some flowers here with this one so comfy put this cotton back in this baggie I'm gonna rip this flower off like so okay so it's gonna pack this in here right guys got the little rx cross there which is pretty sweet that's pretty sweet I think it's pretty sweet goodness drive yeah Cheers I look at that cotton look from the first job that's pretty smooth I just really catching all the gunk that's pretty sweet look there's like no harshness no throat hit let's turn to gather like moisture though you see that why should you feel kind of guys kind of funky it's kind of funky well don't that whole thing round wow that's kind of dirty it's kind of funky looking cotton definitely looks like it's been smoked tear out this again oh my god it's kind of crazy can tell us hand-blown cuz look at the tip like it's kind of like a balloon abuse any obtuse it's not very flat okay just do the daily thing oh you know you can see that the continent really filtering it out which is really cool cuz that's that's like [ __ ] it is not going in my lungs [Laughter] why wouldn't I why would I want this in my lungs I mean hemp is organic but that doesn't mean it doesn't have [ __ ] they won't get you sooner or later poki stick is helpful okay so design all together it's pretty aesthetic you know you got your mouthpiece got your clip holds everything together you got your chamber and put your charcoal put your cotton you put your basis material in the glass bowl with the top I mean it's pretty simple it's pretty simple it's not like rocket science you know like watch science show the design on a scale one to five one being the worst five being the best I gave it a 4 I notice for now reason I don't really go any further than 4 at this point it's because two reasons one I do not like the way this is shaped I don't like the whole bit byte kind of I'm not into that round would have been pretty cool maybe inside out so that it could catch any resins or anything and the second is the ball piece is kind of cone-shaped I mean this kind of this kind of end here is more like what I'm looking at you know I mean I don't have been pretty cool to be like that like round dipped pretty cool um the design on here on the says Jack the Ripper kind of low leg thing can you see it I mean excuse me guys huh not really it would almost be more exciting to not put all the stuff in there you can just use it as a children maybe stuff your herbaceous material in there and smoke through it that might not be a bad idea I mean it could kind of resonate your Bisutti course for later but I don't know I mean maybe it'd be really hard to draw through or Vasudha goals that are packed in there who knows [Music] I'm not I'm not quite certain that this is a gonna become popular I mean maybe", "X0xrqAOKjeU": "buddy we are back one of the review and today I got this silicon glass Chellam to share with you so without further ado let's hop right into this review so I was checking out some chillings of some overseas sellers that were offering some new products and this was one of the ones I was checking out I liked the fact that it was glass which was one of the things that I guess attracted me most about it I like smoking out of glass products and not using aluminum or any of the other smoking products that usually come from overseas but this one looked good and I think what the number one thing that really grabbed me was the fact that the hole wasn't too big so basically what you got here is one of those like glass slides I guess you could say you see if I can peel some of this back here you can kind of see let's see if we can get and roll it back for you and you can see what we what we're talking about here so basically it's like a slide bowl that you would have for a normal pipe it just doesn't have a little handle on it but the silicone little wrap around it well it serves multiple purposes obviously one it helps protect the glass it also allows you to have a little bit of grip edge it also stops it from being super hot when you handling it from using maybe if you happen to smoke the entire bowl you basically would have the tip here would be very hot so the silicon tonsil helps that as well but the whole setup here actually is a pretty nice little setup for a Chilam it is a glass one which is a probably the most attractive feature about it and the silicone does help I mean it goes over really where like the mouthpiece is so it does help it from protection on the bottom of that part the top part again I peeled it back but it was I was trying to reset it a little bit maybe I could twist a little bit just to give you an idea of what it should actually look like so basically it fits just like that where the top layer like that is exposed but other than that you have these five notches that are on the side which allows you to kind of get a little bit of a viewing window to see what's inside how dirty is it you know how much how much is this blockage how much is in the way what's going on in there that allows you to kind of get a 360 view of the entire tube itself which is alright and then it's kind of neat it would probably better if it didn't have those but again I don't know how you would be able to peel that off without having to cut it off if you wanted to clean the glass but these are so inexpensive that you pretty much can just kind of toss this and you know get another one because we're talking 105 dollars per unit here I imagine here stateside if you saw these at your local head shop I wouldn't imagine they're charging more than a couple dollars for these I paid under a dollar for this so imagine how much the markup is if you're paying over five on these so keep that in mind when you are out out and about but again you're gonna find something like this at a convenience type place or a little you know in a smoke shop that maybe might sell a lot of silicon products or parts from overseas you might see these in there and just overlooked because you don't even you assume that it's a silicone shell them but it's got glass on the inside so as far as children's go we've we've done a few reviews on this channel of Chilam z-- and when it comes to the ones that aren't made here stateside as far as overseas children's go these are probably the best ones that I've seen out there again the silicones nice because it definitely protects it from the heat when you're using this chillin but again you're not smoking out of the shell the silicone self the chills made of glass which is superb a whole lot itself look at that that's a really nice hole you could put a little mug right there and that's it you don't worry about a lot of plant material getting pulled through into your mouth which i think is extremely important this tattoo bit self is the same size all the way through which is nice again it's once it gets rezoned up its gonna catch a lot of that plant material that might get sucked into the back of your throat and tickle the back here throat even though the hole is kind of tiny if you pack it right you can definitely maneuver around that hole right there but other than that this little silicone Chilam is pretty legit if you've tried one of these let us know in the comments below you like this video give it a thumbs up and you have to want more content like this and subscribe for more I do smoke

work with nature you can produce the most fire no sorry no commercial synthetic inverts sunshine she is in a very specific place where she can do dry farming it's not the right farming that define quality no she's she's into in osmosis with the place where she is going and she's using that ability to limit totally the water input so that the plants have to kick into a defensive system and produce a lot of regime to protect from dehydration basically third this is the fourth year we're doing on the same exact spot but also to make people kind of understand so it's a flood zone that place floods every 50 years it's under water it's also right in between the Avenue of the Giants which are some of the biggest plants and the biggest respiratory they're breathing all the time and they're blowing they're blowing so much moisture throughout that valley in the morning that yes they're doing your watering for you so it's not like people say oh how can you grow plants without water it's not without what's underneath the ground yes so when you say what's average used for cannabis you're really talking through your head because there's no average juice from that no it all depends depends on the long so she's got redwood air where I grow I have Doug Fir air right Doug for an oak air and so I think that makes a difference so you're gonna I love cold air pilot they're called una caja like Hara Hara Mahadeva Bamboula butene yeah that was the first time it's spirit you have so and this is a brand new chill I'm right down blessings on the children so here we go Thank You Frenchie Wow was a big deal in India because when you did they catch the Chilam to the to the God there is a lot of awareness that comes of what you do like that the panel last night we're talking about making the tea in India when you smoke it's a big deal normally the Chilam always goes right and you pass with you right and you only take with your right hand my friend she had her honor to me passed it this way and then you have to say Kali Chilam which is the feminine energy going to the left side but it's it was all unsaid but he I realized he did it and I realized why he did it to look at that stone children from Funko I don't know the whole lineage of the children thing it was there a Lorenzo - or not know who is that that first guy was Renzo Renzo guy and and does everyone still have a Renzo children no mine was where he was funny because I took only the first year I was in the mountain we were lucky to meet a good friend of my best friend that that spent some time in Colombia thanks guys where we the guy had been 15 years in a mountain and he was buying all the best of the best in toshin act on so for three weeks I saw a lot of ash come in front of my nose and the lesson I took for me you want jungle ocean acting you won't achieve ated Milana so the second year I stand my best friend to get some field as far away from the village as possible in in Milano Valley and and I want to do the jungle in touch and acting for three weeks alone when I came down I'd still night in - in Puglia with an Italian house and that Italian dude was burning chillin was burning chillin in in oven and in the morning and I didn't really understand how special it was to share my own jungle I didn't get his I didn't understand the value people put into the chilly quality of your children and the quality of your regime that defines the respect that you receive so because I cooked up my year jungle all night long with him in the morning if I can give me a Chilam but I didn't know that dude so when arriving Manny Calum and I walk my children with a bunch of Italians they look at me like I had [ __ ] stole the kiss because that guy literally chants totally what Chilam was in India I may you see a different type of clay you see different this is a very important part of any Chilam smoking you want to clean it right because that's another thing they look at your children they pull up the children's this Chilam clean is this dude clean right isn't that right it's part of the ritual and so and also you look out I'll find the polishes inside the children it doesn't to be like a mirror but it's porous so it's going to absorb a lot of the tar from it no it's all clear it's all clear over and over and two three four different type of clay yeah it absorb yeah you want that absorption but see this is the high art this is the high art of chillin making you see because you can get these little throwaway chillings all over the place that are little tiny one to one or two people chill them so that's true that sort of status I suppose it's all about don't give you that to smoke when they look at your ash they don't know you you need maybe it's like when you don't understand that the world respects that you receive it the Chilam you have in your on and the quality of the resin you put in even 15-20 years old people in in India if you have the goods they're going to give you respect doesn't matter how long you've been in India if you don't have it they don't even give you the time of the day I swear it's not very nice actually they are not really welcoming well it's the caste system yeah yeah you got it you got to earn your credits no question about it but how hardcore is it to go up into the mountains like I've got lost there before it's like leaving the cave for months two days walk the closest bus it's today's walk explain and you have to bring all your [ __ ] and it's you have to be crazy crazy crazy about raising quality to put yourselves with that type of [ __ ] then it's at the at before the winter if you get stuck in mulana with the snow and there is one pass at 12,000 feet when you have that pass and you have like a snow up to your your tight and shitty basket or old and plastic bag to stay you know I mean it's your you can kill yourself you have to be now that I think of it with such stepping back so far with like I was insane to do [ __ ] like that but it's the best time in my life in Nepal and I went from pokhara to kathmandu and i had to walk about 2/3 of the way just making the road and at one point is like barefoot you're walking along this thing and you're just out of the village and no one speaks English they were moving from me to take her like the chance my visa I was going to change my sermons visa I was supposed to face shortywood here they wanted see Susan would be I am gonna come back to go now the first time first time I went to Nepal I believe was 70 70 we I was working on a movie called Sun seed and we were filming various teachers around so we went in filmed at the swabue we filmed the rinpoche at swayambhu with the long trumpets like that whoo and they're doing a snapping thing and they're chanting this an amazing chanting and pouring tea it's up on top of the hill there and then I went back a year later but I went over land from from Amsterdam right all the way up to Nepal again and then I had a house in back of swayambhu and I stayed there for about three months there and every day around the temple you know around the hill swayambhu hill right yeah I wasn't really into the hash at the point it was just there I wasn't like you I wasn't seeking out that most rare extreme place I was there just to be sitting in painting and being meditating", "9ZCP1Dgqzi0": "[Music] what's up fellow cannabis growers and welcome back for another episode of greenbox grown my name is Dylan and as promised I'm gonna be reviewing two of the products that I picked up last weekend at grow ex up in San Jose California and again for those of you who didn't see the last video grow ex is a cultivation based cannabis convention there's a few locations that happens out throughout the year just a happened last weekend it was up in San Jose which is near where I live so I went checked it out so the two products I'm gonna be reviewing are the Lock and Load Chellam and this is by biohazard Inc incorporated but it's just basically they sell all kinds of glass smoking accessories like grinders everything from bubblers to bait pens to concentrate containers and everything in between so definitely check their site out they have a lot of good products I already smoked one of these as you can see this one's all dirty but they're really cool for a few reasons one of them is the screw on cap but I'll get into more details on that later the other company I would be reviewing is ona and they are an odor neutralization company whether that be for your grow rooms or just for smoking indoors or in certain areas of the house alright so now that you guys know which companies I'll be reviewing I'm gonna do each review individually for the specific product and so the first one I want to do is the Lock and Load chil'en by biohazard glass and the first thing I want to mention on this thing which is really cool is it has this screw on cap over the bowl so you can pack the bowl before you go wherever you're going to smoke if it's outdoors put this in your pocket that worrying if it's gonna spill out and you're good to go the other thing is it's a really strong glass that it's made out of I mean you can drop it from I mean relatively high I dropped it on the cement while we were walking nothing happened the cap was on to you so he didn't even lose the ball so very portable don't obviously be throwing it on the ground trying to break it but it is durable also which is great right now I'm grinding up some Northern Lights from my recent auto flower grow which I'll be using to test out the Lock and Load one-hitter one thing I did notice using it before though it's kind of sucks is because this hole is so fat where the bull piece is if you suck too hard you will be getting a lot of Scooby Snacks in your mouth or just essentially pulling through pieces of the weed so you don't need to hit it very hard to get a good hit just a slight pull will do alright so now the bowl is packs and now I'm gonna take a hit I'll show you guys how it goes Cheers it's a pretty fat bullet to you so you can get a couple hits if you are just taking like medium-size ribs don't want the house to stink up too much yeah really smooth the rib like I said really portable and durable which is nice and the cap is a huge bonus for pre packing the ball so definitely recommend checking out biohazard inks page and all their glass all right so now that you guys saw the Lock and Load Chilam I'm going to talk about the ona odor neutralization company basically they sell a few different products ranging from these big filled odor gel containers I mean what these are for is for neutralizing grow rooms and stuff liqueur just like if you just harvested you can open one of these up near that room or inside the room and it'll eliminate that odor pretty quickly I recommend putting these outside or near the grow room because you don't want the smell to actually get on the canvas itself but you don't want the outer lip escaping from that room so you know just kind of surrounding the borders of the room with this stuff is really helpful it does come in different size containers and different scents but the pro scent is what's recommended for cannabis odor neutralization just because of how strong it is and then they have these credit card sprayers they call them which you saw me actually using a little bit earlier in the video when I was smoking but just great for if you're smoking in a room inside we're just somewhere where you don't want to leave the cannabis odor behind honestly it just takes like one of these little spritzes and the whole room the smell within the whole room will be gone within a minute at most so when it comes to ona I actually use their product several different products buy them for my grow rooms eliminating smells whether that's my indoor grow rooms or my outdoor greenhouses because you still don't want it to smell up in your yard for your neighbors to have to deal with if they're not into that so I use their products out there and inside with my grow rooms for that and then I also use what I was just talking about the credit card sprayer for if I'm smoking inside or if I forget my smoke so I'll just have one of these lying around usually or in my car or something and I can just spritz it and eliminate the odor right there so so not only are those two great individual products but those two brands are also really reputable and offer other great products like I was saying that you may or may not need to use at some point in your growing career but that is all I have for now in terms of reviewing these two products you guys enjoyed the video please subscribe and give us the thumbs up also don't forget to comment below with your feedback or any other requests for other product reviews and as always thank you for watching and happy growing you", "LBNDCyQgr7I": "hey what's up get

yeah it was gone and you guys can see some streaks yourself first so we're gonna get started we're gonna pack a nice Bowl on this then we're gonna take a couple of hits actually this is my official review on the chillest and see if I like it do I recommend them to you maybe my opinion when I was young is no but maybe you could change cuz he's been like years that I have smoked out of a chunk I'm like more of a bomb person oil rig you know I really don't even like the nectar either the nectar collector never try to do but you know the way a little just doesn't catch my attention at all so if you guys don't know what's a nectar collector look it up on YouTube and you know if you guys like it you guys want to see it on my channel please recommend it to me other than that I would not get it so yeah we have a little peck right here yeah yo what we're gonna hit this we're gonna take closer look on this herb so until then children till then we're gonna smoke out of this chillin chillin

the ones that are falling on I hope you veget getting high with me as all you guys you know like I don't like smoking by myself so whatever you guys get served with that hold on what are you guys like to use again medicated on cannabis related is fine with me so anyways Cheers just hits just like a normal piece all right bye ah I don't know if I packed it too much or if it's clogged I do not know if it's just a tiny hole I don't know and it feels right this time I'm supposed to like I'm hitting it really hard so maybe that's that's it you have to take my time here anyways cheers guys sorry look at this chillin pretty nice it's nice and just that ah honestly I really thought my opinion is gonna change this I have a smoke gonna chill for like six years but you know why I'm getting the same experience that I had when I was young which was the hitting process they're hitting it just doesn't give me enough function for me to get a nice little hit uh it does hit but it hits four little hits basically like if you're trying to hide something for somebody this is something that you just buzz doubted it you know that's it but I mean personally my purse my perfect personal opinion I like I like pieces that have carbs knowing that I'm gonna get a nice decent hand knowing that it's gonna go straight into my nose all nice um this it's just like smoking a cigarette nothing really to it that huh matter of fact gates like a blunt I like blunts me personally I do smoker but not occasionally so I'm more of a bomb person like I said if you guys if you guys want to chill if you guys want something that you guys could just walk around to eat at one time I I recommend a chilling but if you guys like to get big and get those not that nice smoke inside your drugs I suggest a piper bug with the car but anyways Cheers don't get me wrong it's nice it's gonna do the job but it's just I want more small cosmetics so anyways spent another ball so right here we have the newest uncle-ji close the big off this it's beautiful costume I mean the curb turn with it okay let's take a nice leg off this disturb a beautiful herb it's not the best herb that I had but he was on the right price and it was $35 a day all the good stuff is in the center of this herb mmm sorry but hold on I'm just put all so yeah here it is as you guys can see it's not really that trend but the only reason why I got it is because it did have that smell from back in the day that cush when I was young in high school um you know it's nice creep yes nice little crystals in the center of this but let's break up another dead see it's not the best [ __ ] like I said but it would do the job it will get you hot so yeah that's it I'm gonna smoke another bullet you guys this but right here yeah see the other

so state if to go", "DZA-4Csi3lo": "better be our back another review and today we are checking out this graph labs Chilam so without further ado let's hop right into the review so we got this graph labs Chilam here and the one thing that i did like about this particular thing right off the bat was what it was made of it's made with Baro glass the for us to look at Pyrex glass so you don't have to worry about this basically shattering under extreme temperatures so we did want to hit this with a torch or something you wouldn't have to worry about that so that is one thing you get right off the bat that is nice about this is what's made with and grabbed labs makes about medium medium grade glass I'd say not high-end not low-end for sure but probably medium grade glass it's more of an industrial type of look to it which is something similar to this which is kind of more scientific or industrial in regards to the way the chilla is not heavy at all and it does have a very industrial look to it not much fanciness on it which is nice sometimes it's nice to get a nice plain glass piece we have here grav labs is etched in there as you can see right here and it's basically the inverse edging which allows you to have the smoother part be the actual logo and the etched part be the background and then on the inside here we can see our nice little double pinch all the way through and see it goes to like a nice little hourglass right there this is going to be the end where you're gonna put your material that you're smoking right here and you do have a nice long straw part from where the actual Bowl is so where the mouthpiece is you don't to worry about that getting too hot so you can definitely use this for multiple uses but I haven't worried about it getting too hot again your you're dealing with burro glass here so it's gonna be really easy to clean it's not gonna stain that's another big thing to at the borer glasses it doesn't stain a lot of the times you'll get resin buildup especially on something like this which probably wouldn't get cleaned that off then you get resin buildup on it and it eventually will discolor the glass this will look like the day that you bought it as long as you clean it with some like isopropanol or some kind of a solvent that's going to get anything this after class should make it look exactly like this so that's a little plus in this and this was on the economical side we're talking ten bucks here for a nice little chillin like this that's retail that's how much you would pay if you were to look this up on the internet and go find it yourself but you have about ten bucks pretty nice little chillin here definitely something that's a nice price point for a throwaway piece or something that you might want to keep in your arsenal for daily use or even occasional use so I like this if you like chums let us know in the comments below if you like grab labs as a glass maker or glass blower let us know in the comments below as well if you've had any other products just shoot us up so comments down there and let us know how your experience was with them like this video give it a thumbs up what more content like this subscribe for more we do smoking reviews every single Monday so be on the lookout for that and have a great rest your day", "ed1bNpaNbNg": "I'd like to tell everybody tonight about a little item I found that the local dispensary and it's called Chilam oh gee it's a glass tube that's pinched a little bit and see pinched a little at one end then just continues out in a straight line to exit and what I discovered by hit-and-miss is if you take a filter that you can find these very commonly anywhere on the Internet this is the size I found and I'll take a little and cut it so that there's a cut it like maybe two-thirds through the diameter this is difficult I've never done this before and then you can shape it into a cone I'll try to do that and stay in focus maybe fold it a quarter of the way over and give it some disciplining pinches here and there doesn't have to be perfect and you can actually take this if you want and you can take a like the tip of a paintbrush I'm using and you can force this down into the notch and it fits well enough to stay there I don't and if you can see that it's forming a little cup a little Sybil's and what this does it allows a consumer to consume a very small amount of cannabis very quickly and usually with a very good effect I wanted to get to the back end of things and the diameter of this is such that you can take again a commonly obtained cigarette filter and you can insert the cigarette filter on the other side so you've got your cigarette filter there and I'll just turn this over and you've got a screen there as far as the type of metal and whatever arises from the keep that is given to the screen and the cannabis that that's kind of up to your own decision-making and comfort zone okay so there you have it and you can I'm sure everybody out there has got a better way of loading up here and I just wanted to show that this I've never done this before so I can't really get me in the picture here but I'm putting them you can just barely see putting the and so on and then you can pack it in again with I've got some you can see how little I kind of wanted to get everybody's attention to see how little actual cannabis that you you know pull it back that you're actually taking in you're that's that's not a really great amount I would roughly estimate it's about half of a conventional bowl but I'm not a really long time user so don't take that one too seriously okay and so you probably", "9jWso-r727E": "yo safe guys is toxic meat and today we're back movement of a kind of this review and it's not ordinary kind of this review so this one's going to be coming out in the week so what we've got here is the og Chilam we're trying to do this property they're hard for us like I said before it's got a few finger marks on it forgot to wipe it down before we start the video but we've took some pictures we've been looking up like where your children start from it would have been a plain Chilam it would have gone into like a conical shape a bit like a traffic cone shape and they would wrap a rag at the bottom and they would like cut hit in between the fingers and stuff like that sometimes you use a pebble or stone as the balls so it would get quite hot when the brac was there is like a thing to call it down basically it mainly was like it originated in like India I think it was don't hold me to it but they've made glass versions these and best versions because they're in like really nothing holding it in here so you've got a packet quite a lot to start off with just to give it that extra bit so it's not too too hot and just dump hot too much on it like it's not like a bong hit it's not like a pipe here you're just doing small little puffs no one again Isis packed what we've got in there is we've got some star dog mixed with some probably exclusive purple dog mixed with some chocolate local CBD hash if you haven't seen the review of that links gonna be in the description go check it out and then topped off with a bit more startup as you can see down through there hopefully well you going to see pictures anyway but this is pretty packed inside of here so this should last as a nice little little time we are going to struggle because we've got this we're going to try and like with this we've got a windproof lighter so hopefully it actually helps us like the Chilam a little easier so once we've got it lit we're going to light it like this for a stop once we've got it lit we are going to try and do a one-handed method hopefully it works be able to light the Chilam so first time trying to chill up so we're going to let you know exactly how it is so we've got our whimpering fire we've got a chillin right you might have packed it a little too tight now there we go when you give it up get to the end of it don't talk it as hard because when you get to there get much pop pop back and hit me in the throat so part my memory is for guys basically did do most of the video as you can see nice little bit white ashen now some of this gray is is the some of its not burnt properly we still got a bit too burnt but we was hitting the children properly but after that again obviously those all storage was filled up on our phone and we forgot to delete some old videos so just trying like this again that's that now that was the last hit but as you can see space with us the og chillin it's a really nice piece of kit so basically you're not meant to do it in a middle finger and the ring finger only meant to do an odd little finger and the ring finger that's the original wave but I just can't get used to that because broke my knuckles quite so so basically you could smoke it this way if you smoke it that way that way the original way you can use it I would say is like a bit of a doctor foot bongs so if you want to feel any side up you can fill it right up on this side and just a massive like yep so it fits in your downstem so if you've got a nice luck connection that fits on that fill that up you can have a nice long here if you really wanted to there's a couple different ways and stuff up to use it I'm feeling quite high this star though purple dog and the chocolate local partners kicked in really nicely it's really nice hit on it um it's not as harsh as I thought it was going to be some pipes have been a lot harsher so yeah but ot Chilam some nice like resin buildup in there as well nice resin builder you can see after a while of using this if you I'll call wash this you would get some nice reclaimed buck so there's a good little handy tool to smoke some material through and still get reclaim as well because it's glass is a lot more easier to clean and get you material but if you know how to anyways guys this has been a really nice one children ot chillin May she gets off one I got this one from my marital mystery box if you haven't checked that video up I think it's gonna be in the description got a load of different things there was like parsley stuff that was for the giveaway so then we basically put some of the stuff that we want inside and now we're reviewing some of things for you guys we've still got a pickle drip pipe another American pipe a bracelet pipe some bowling like material like rips left not wrapped up in cigar people blunt wrap so backward split bulbs we've got the og sweet ones in the on

fruit from the citrus family Orange bowl and lemon bowl give a strong flavor and in comparison with any other fruit bowls, they give the most flavor in our session To make ur job easier choose a big orange to use Moreover, make sure that the fruit and the skin of the fruit is hard enough in order to withstand the heat and maximize its endurance So lets see how to make an orange bowl that will give your smoking session a nice orange taste Using a knife we make our first cut high in the fruit make sure your cut is straight In our next step, using the apple knife We drill a hole in the middle of the fruit this will help us later on with the cavity if its easier for you, flip the orange this way and then drill the hole The orange is a very juicy fruit We will try to dry a bit our cavity later on but first we must make our cavity using the curving knife we cut out our cavity The diameter of our cavity must be around 7-7.5 cm The size of the cavity depends of the amount of tobacco you wish to use We make our cavity a bit wider Remove any pips you find We will place our toothpicks on the bottom of the cavity in order to avoid our toothpicks getting burned from the heat of the coals We now use our toothpicks Just like this If its the first time you are watching us We use the toothpicks in order to create a barrier on the bottom of the cavity that will hold the tobacco in the fruit Put some more toothpicks As I said before we will use a napkin to dry a bit the juices of the orange In todays episode we are going to use Argelini ''Creamy Peach'' and Al Fakher ''Melon'' The orange is now ready The tobacco leaves of Argelini don't need any choping we are only going to chop the Al Fakher The amount of tobacco you will use, depends of the time you wish your session to last We will now chop a the tobacco chop your tobacco a bit Now we mix with argelini As I said before,  we use Argelini ''Creamy Peach'' and Al Fakher ''Melon'' We use a fluff pack to put the tobacco in the orange Pack up to the top leap of the fruit In this point, in order to make the airflow better We use a toothpick to open a small hole in the middle of the tobacco to help our tobacco to roast properly The orange is now ready to place on our hookah Today, we have the honor to enjoy for the first time here The new Hydrex H1 FX That Andreas send for us to try I 've prepared a small fruit cocktail in the base Place the orange on the hookah make sure it sits straight Today we are using kaloud lotus a very good heat management on the fruits don't forget the hose The lifetime of our fruit bowl depends on the amount of tobacco you are using ask the crew to bring me the heat managment thank you we place the heat management on the fruit As I said in previous episodes Because of the fact that orange and the rest citrus fruits have hard skin the cleaning of the heat management after using it is easier put the cover on If you use heat management like kaloud you must wait for a few minutes until is warm enough and ready If you use something else like kaya block for example you can preheat the HMD on the coil and you can start smoking faster Our hookah is now ready to smoke The orange pass a nice fruity taste on our session As the time pass The heat of the HMD will rise and you will have more dense clouds Thanks to the small hole we opened in the middle of our pack the airflow is very good and its easily compared with any regular bowl Thanks for watching the video Stay tuned to the channel and don't lose the upcoming episodes with more fruit bowls If you want you

tall in India well we're all packed up [Music] I can cry mrs. place we are heading to another ashram that's located in the jungles just outside of Gwalior we've been staying in this jungle ashram for about a week with this Baba called sharm sunder das baba humps honored us baba is this guy that is liberated in the sense of like a Buddha he's a Buddha and he's been meditating in caves and he's been just doing this true spiritual work for the last like 30 years he's what we called the real deal [Music] in India they touched the feet of saints they pranaam bow down and they touch the feet of these people as sort of a recognition that they walked the path a recognition that this person is a reflection of our inner divinity a reflection of our divine potential touching their feet is a way to surrender [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sona baba the guy with the long hair yeah every day he would try to give me a smoke with him today was special because we were heading to an ancient temple that is maybe another hour into the jungle we're like three hours into the jungle at this point when we arrived here the sona Baba asked me to drive with him I was like okay fine you know I'll leave my little my comfort zone of my group of friends and I'll Drive with this with this guy plus I was like I could get down with some hash right now I'm we're going to this ancient temple in the jungle maybe it'll enhance the experience it'll allow me to tune in to this to this moment more it was just us in this other guy and they whipped out this pipe and I was like okay yeah why not why not the power of why not well we were heading to this temple not only to just bathe in the beauty of this magnificent place in the middle of nowhere but the Baba wanted to give us spiritual names it's an honor and a real privilege to get a name from a saint or from a guru hike down this thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's nice this temple is built around this cave and this cave had a real deep tunnel into it and these Yogi's would go into the cave and they wouldn't come back out and so it developed this legend that this cave is the entrance into the underworld so nur Baba grabs my hand and he's like come on we're gonna go we're gonna go we're gonna climb and we climb to the top of this temple maybe it's seven stories or something like that we're gonna climb up this climb climb climb Jay okay guru Buddha guru better move without your mother Billy man I love the man Baba good not even good Nadi so I walk in and the first thing that happens is just a swarm of bats just start flying everywhere and I'm just like oh okay yeah of course of course there's bats [Music] oh yeah I put it oh come in look up for the bets oh yeah it's uh oh boy oh boy oh yeah [Music] do you dip it Nikita [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hopefully calm [Music] every day I spent with the Baba he would say to me tomorrow I give you an an Indian name I give you a spiritual name tomorrow and then tomorrow would come and he goes your nam tomorrow tomorrow at one point I was joking with him I was like okay Baba my spiritual name is tomorrow but after we were exploring around climbed to the top of this temple and just you know got my adventure fix the Baba sat us all down there's a group of us here he sits us down he's sharing stories and he is just talking and randomly he looks at my friend Michael and he goes your name hottie das and then he looks at me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the data Guinness is the giver of all the cities even poverty son this is the data he gives all the cities he distributes [Music] so he gave me the name Ganesh Das Ganesh Ganesh like the elephant god Ganesh Dossett and he also gave me the name Kali das and he said you choose ganesh does Kali Joss and I think I'm not choosing Bob well this isn't my choice this isn't for me to choose I don't get to pick my spiritual name the whole this is you know and he's he's sat there for a second and he goes Ganesh is a good name Ganesh das is a good name okay Ganesh das it is but I want you to give me your favorite name of Ganesh because these gods have tons of different names like Krishna has Krishna Govinda Mohan Gopala there's a bunch of different names that represent the one so he gave me the name gudgeon none gudgeon none das gudgeon done means the one with the elephant head who holds the entire universe inside of him and das means like servant of servants of Ganesh Ganesh is the the remover of obstacles my mom is going through a rough time right now just going through a divorce she just lost her mom my grandma just passed away my grandpa is not doing so well and so my mom is in this sort of tidal wave of truth she's really experiencing reality the the grips that reality has on us you know we so much and so often live in this realm of illusion that were attached to this illusion of permanence that things are going to stay you know we link our moments up in a chain and don't realize that you know at any second this there is no chain we're not really connected to anything and any second anything can happen so naturally I was like mom what do you I'm gonna bring you home from India I'll get you a gift whatever you want and she goes oh you just bring me home a little Ganesh and I told the Baba this and he just looked at me and smiled and then at this point I'm just sitting with the Baba just me and him and a couple of other sad news and Indian people all the other everyone else is getting ready to leave and I'm just kind of sitting there you know maybe looking through the photos I take in and he goes my gudgeon and us you throw a party for because he gave me a name like I'm gonna throw a party now because I'm you know finally on the path or whatever reason you know and yeah Bob I'll throw a party sure I'll get home I throw a party he goes no no no we don't throw a party now and then all the Indians in the place just started cheering and clapping and it was a real it was really special it was really special time so we left the ancient temple and went back to the normal temple that the jungle Baba stays at shops under dusty is that and we just did this sort of routine of singing songs doing kirtan singing to Rama and Sita or Shiva or Krishna and we're just talking about philosophy what happens when we die is does the individual soul exist I asked all sorts of questions to him and I'll upload some more footage of me asking him questions and just other footage in general in a comming video but then he would just feed us we would just go eat food and then we would take a nap it was like a yogi daycare [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

known as shisha of course some coals now we're gonna start by cutting down the grapefruit about 3/4 of the way up we want to cut a straight as possible giving us a nice flat surface to work with next up we're going to grab our apple corer and we're gonna go ahead and cut right down the middle to make a hole [Music] now we want to get our sharp knife again and go ahead and cut out a 35 to 45 degree angle creating a bowl for our tobacco to sit in [Applause] cool now let's grab our toothpicks we're going to shove them in at an angle and then go ahead and flatten them out that way our tobacco doesn't fall through the hole there we have two different flavors of tobacco here so we're gonna go ahead and mix them up however it's not a bad idea to mix up your tobacco even if you just have one flavor so we're gonna go ahead and add it to the bowl here you want to add it as loose as possible that way airflow can get through there and it's not packed too tightly let's grab our foil the foil we have is pre-cut with holes already pre punched in there you don't have this that's okay you can just grab a regular foil and poke the holes in there yourself when you put the foil on there you do want to put it on as smooth and as straight as possible [Music] and we want airflow to come down through the holes but not necessarily leak through the sides so you want to make sure that it's on there nice and tight let's go ahead and grab our toothpicks we're gonna shove them in there and angle this way our foil is not coming off and our tobacco is staying in there as well that's it now grab

be showing you how to make the orange pipe slash Clementine pipe it's gonna work either way obviously I have a Clementine here what you're gonna also need some kind of pokey device I recommend scissors or you know maybe a nail screwdriver whatever get creative and then some kind of tube like a straw or a pen that has been hollowed out luckily this one is just a screw off so it's everything kind of screws off and it's good to go you might have to bite your [ __ ] off or cut it off or you know figure some way out to get the [ __ ] out of that pen we're gonna keep the end on just so it's a better poking device we can also use this in the build now I like to flip my orange or Clementine upside down because it does have this little divot that you know resembles a bowl shape at least to a certain degree and this is gonna be poking at the top and you're enough to kind of remove this which is it's a lot easier to go through the bottom what you're gonna want to do first is just measure about halfway through down into the orange or Clementine and then poke down there with your scissors actually use the more kind of narrow end measure it poke down and then just kind of do a little spin you know make a bowl shape clear out some of the debris now you don't really have to worry too much about the skin of the orange just kind of compress it down and it's gonna form into a bit of a bowl shape as you do it take your pen or another pokey device measure out about to the middle so I'm going to luckily I have these rings that are kind of on the pen I don't know if you can see that but I'm gonna go about to the third ring maybe a little bit farther is what I'm seeing so obviously the middle of the orange go down to the the third ring or your measurement of how far you need to go down and then I can I think I can see it through there but just to test kind of poke it check it out oh yeah you can hear clinking off the little pen there so lots of air airflow which the airflow edge is good I will say that it seems pretty airtight luckily the skin doesn't have a lot of any it's not really too porous so in no air is really gonna be going through that it's gonna be pretty airtight now through your side that you've had your pen in kind of connect it you don't have to push it too far in its obviously it's gonna be a little distant from where you're pushing it with with whatever pokey device and then check it out for air tightness sounds amazing I don't know if you can hear it but it sounds pretty good to me now after you've done that you have your nice little orange pipe kind of looks like a pumpkin not gonna lie a little little tiny pumpkin pipe may be good to go like usual if you want to throw a choke into this little bastard just kind of poke a little side hole and you're good to go you've cleared out of space and you you know you block it you hold it smokes get in and it sits in the chamber you let go good to go so let's load some mayor jhemini's into this little bastard well we'll use our finger to clear kind of a wider hole and pack a nice little bowl into this obviously oranges you're gonna be able to pack a bigger bowl into like full-size not not clementines but for the Clementine it's pretty nice little Bowl nice decent little sized pipe it's gonna get you a couple good rips let's let's hit her that's pretty decent might have thought again no I'm gonna live pretty good citrusy flavor and bed it into that weed another good tip make sure your your pen isn't going too far you don't want to have like charred burning weed hit that pen because it is gonna melt it a little bit you're gonna get some some fumes and tastes luckily I was pretty good I moved it a little bit back just in case I don't think singing you'll taste it when you're smoking some [ __ ] that's nasty that you shouldn't be smoking but we'll smoke one final Tokyo talk about some [ __ ] there you go nice little orange pipe sets up by itself another little tip if realistically if you uh if it isn't setting up you can just kind of compress it a little bit and it'll get a flatter bottom there you go it's sitting flat you need to be if you haven't checked out the channel a bit I'm sorry I haven't been posting any videos in a while [ __ ] has been kind of tough it's been hard to get a schedule going Internet's been [ __ ] around I know it sounds a little

YouTube I'm imaging and this is the 3-inch rasta pop gem from wwd quality glass calm this Chellam was marched down from twenty-five dollars to six dollars which is why we chose this one because it was on sale for a really good price um the glass is thick the hole in the bottom of this bowl is rather small so you don't have to worry about getting tobacco in your mouth when you're smoking out of this one and the mouthpiece is a decent size the only problem it's not really a problem I like it but the only flaw I would say of this one is the shape it's a weird design and it's kind of awkward to get used to but once you've had it for a minute you smoke out of it and get used to it it's not that awkward it's just different um it was another thing oh yeah and it's again a really small piece it I

doesn't spill [Music] as you can see as I moved the bag so in the brown stuff from the gunk pill top starts to come off it's been about 45 minutes or so and now let's take it out of the bag and just run run a little clean water through it help get rid of that excess Epsom salt and isopropyl alcohol okay we have just rinsed our Chilam and one-hitters off next we're gonna take our paper towel and we're just gonna wipe I'm gonna ball it up just a little bit I'm sticking in here and just try to wipe some of this off glass normally cleans very very easily and as you can see just all the gunk on the paper towel there next I'm with a q-tip and just try to get some of the other gunk out of here and you're going to want to keep working on it till you get to your desired level of cleanliness this is also time you take your pipe cleaner and if you look you see some of the gunk built up here and just take it to help clean it some so we'll continue to do this until it's clean now as you can see I've spent a couple minutes just cleaning it with a q-tip and a um pipe cleaner and as you can see it is much much cleaner now and suitable for use next to clean your one-hitter it's a little more difficult because you don't have as much space just where I highly recommend q-tips and just gonna turn them around there and after letting it soak for a while you see how much gunk comes off [Music] if you need to take a little cup of rubbing alcohol or even what's already in your bag the q-tip in it just to help give it a little more moisture and cleaning power to the q-tip while still containing some gunk inside it is much easier to smoke from now question is about what level do you want to stop cleaning in that's all personal preference you can clean it to looks like it's brand-new again but that will take some elbow grease with a little rubbing alcohol q-tips again the longer you soak it the easier it is to clean these have been soaking for about 45 minutes I've left some metal one-hitters which this is inside the solution for overnight and it was much easier to clean it's really personal preference now as you can see after a little bit of elbow grease we have some very clean one-hitters and a chill I'm ready to smoke so I'm gonna take a little alien OG from karma suta khals load it right into my one-hitter and it's time to take the puff [Music] [Music] [Music]", "yF3LR6TaovA": "hey everybody turn in who shatters I'm Shay I make a fresh apple here to go let's get straight into it all right so the first thing we need to do is fill our actual drum up with water now to determine how much water this is based on the cells of the actual hair now would you have only about that much of it should sit into the water if you put too much water for it to go all the way up here you're gonna suck water throw at it so based on that we need the water to fill up to about here just like so so as you can see it's in there by about a centimetre now very important to use fresh cold water don't use hot water don't use old water that will affect the taste so let's move on to making the head so guys I will be doing this for the apples so what we're gonna do an apple is just push it on top like that just so we know how thick it is so what we're gonna do now it's just using the back of a spoon or a small knife we're just gonna pour and go all the way through to the top just like soon so should be nice and clean like that now this is the top so again she's gonna so we're just going to cut the top like that and now using a spoon what we're gonna do is start to take the flesh out like that so have it on a slant so you're actually going deep we don't need to take too much out just about halfway like that if you take too much out you're just gonna put a lot more molasses in and it's just wasted so that's what we're gonna do now is just fill out a pull-up with our molasses let's just gently push it in like that don't force it in because you're gonna suck out the air you need the air to fill it full so now we're just gonna get some aluminium for the shiny sides has to go on the bottom let's just place it on our Apple in the middle just make that nice and tight and you just want to get yourself a toothpick or something sharp and just make a couple of holes in there like that now you can also find tools like this on the market which make all the holes for you so if you have a look on eBay or something you can find these for a few loads so that's our actual Apple heads ready now so we're gonna go back to our okay so what we need to do now is just put a piece of fall over their head like that because we don't want any of that molasses to fall into an actual hookah and we're just gonna create a couple of small holes on the top like that so what we're gonna do now is put our source on people like that and our apple head can go straight on like that so let's take it outside for a test now all right guys so what place I'll call on so I'm just gonna put two pieces don't put too many your burner and try to place them on the slides [Applause] alright guys and after about a minute you'll start to fool the flavour and the smoke coming through just like so I hope you like that guys please like and subscribe if you got any comments or suggestions just leave them at the bottom and I'll see you next time", "n6KtvwaD5JY":

be smoking from my getting stuff is definitely gonna be from state quality class comp just cuz no one really ever beat their prices yeah I haven't noticed anything yet so the quality glass that come check them out take quality class calm I peace out you to do another video later on of me using these bad boys but this is just my unboxing so P so", "kpG6OuQ-6Dc": "hey guys I'm gonna be showing you how to make a one-hitter slash chillin with a sharpie yeah alright so for this all you're gonna need is aluminum foil some tape obviously a sharpie lighter and a toothpick or safety pin alright so first of all the sharpie will have an end like right there I already taped off everything and but you're gonna have to pull the piece off yeah so it's gonna leave you with like an open space right here and so after that you take the aluminum foil and cut it to where like it hangs off like right there on all the sides and then this is how you put it in so make sure it's like flat and it's hanging off like that and then this is how I put it in you take your finger and push on it and then push in make sure to not rip it though and then just go like this and just turn it but make sure you're not pushing that hard and then after that take your no don't do that yet and then fold all your pieces down like that and make sure they're all folded down and then take your tape and fold like a little sheet make sure it's not too big though around it and the only reason I do this is because some people if they blow out they'll blow the aluminum foil out like my friend and lose all their weed so yeah so that's why I put tape and after that you need to cut a small hole I don't know if you can see that and the bottom of it with oh yeah you also need a knife so you can cut the hole and yeah and then use their lighter and burn like a hole like right there so you can put your finger and use it as a carb I mean some people put the aluminum foil and their actual carb and just suck out of that end but I think this way is better because you can actually use it like a rod and yeah so it's called a one-hitter but you can actually use this multiple times but it's also a Chilam cuz you have to load a lot in there but yeah is to use it just put your finger on it and then suck in in that hole while you're lighting it with your lighter so it's gonna be like this and then suck in yeah alright guys I'll be posting more videos of stuff like this yeah stay for a 20-piece", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the camera i don't know how the lighting is but yeah hopefully you guys do see that so it's more of like a sauce and we're gonna be hitting it off of my blender so i'm really excited to be going over this sauce because it does taste and smell really good so i'm gonna go ahead and heat up my banger and i'll be back once it's all hot so i'm just waiting for my trip timer to go off but here's the the wax or sauce so it's really saucy and once this timer goes off i'm gonna go ahead and put this on top and we're gonna go ahead and take a rip i'm gonna

No mess, no bags, no microwave, no boiling on the stove, nothing like that. Very simple, very effective. I really like this method. uh... First you want to seal off the bowl, and any other holes that might be on the pipe like carbs, or anything like that. I'm using electrical\ntape. You don't have to but it works very well, it doesn't leak if you wrap it correctly, and most people have it laying around... but I've used plastic wrap in the past and other things... but anyway, you want to completely seal off the\npipe like i'm doing here. I'm going to speed it up just a bit here... and next we're going to grab some kosher salt. (just press that in and make sure\neverything is all sealed off) I'm going to use kosher salt here, you don't have to. If you just have regular salt you can use that too, but kosher salt is a more effective scrubbing agent. You don't want it completely\npacked full, you want room for your solvent as well, which we'll add in a second... If you end up with too much salt in there just knock a bit of it back out. I'm using 100% pure acetone.\nYou can also use nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol, but pure acetone is the best, it work like magic. As with the salt, you don't want it completely full of acetone. You want some air in there, maybe about twenty percent. You want your cleaning solution to be able to move freely and move around... so leave a little air in there. We're going to finish sealing off the pipe. Make sure it's completely sealed up, and tight. And then you're going to shake, shake, shake, shake! If you clean your pipe on a regular basis you can get away with two or three minutes, and it will be clean. If it's REALLY funky, I've had to shake up to ten minutes. It just depends on how much use the pipe has gotten. Shake shake shake! also I just want to make a little note: I've seen a lot of videos here on YouTube where people are putting alcohol and salt into a bag and they're kind of missing the point. The\npoint of the salt is that it doesn't dissolve in the solvent and remains a good scrubbing agent. You want that on the inside of the pipe That's why I like to sealing it off like I do in this method. ... also you'll notice I already had the water running before I rinse it out, because you want it to be nice and hot when you use it first, you don't want to wait for it to heat up. I'm going to manually scrub out the bowl here because you'll usually have a couple little bits and pieces left in there, it doesn't get a lot of flow... but the insides are already perfect. I'm going to give it one little quick rinse here with acetone, one more time, just to get rid of anything that may have redeposited on the inside of the pipe when I put the water in there. Give it one more hot water rinse, make sure you have all the residue out and it is just clean water. Dry it off. I'm going to bring it back over to the light source so you can see how we did... BOOM! Clean pipe, like the day it was blown.", "2kmtgLS_SRM": "Hello friends, Welcome to Shopdop again. I welcome you again to our channel Today we have brought a new bowl/chillum whose name is Printed German Bowl This bowl looks very attractive Its main feature is that this bowl is made of clay which is very strong and printed also As you can see that its depth is quite well which helps in storing a good amount of flavor Its upper diameter is 2.5 inches wide and this bowl is 3.5 inches long. Let's try this on hookah. First, I put flavor in it. Then I attached its drama kaloud and lastly, I put coal here. Now I am generating heat with the help of smoke maker. We have also posted a video on smoke maker. You can view it on our channel. As you can see that it produces very dense smoke If you find this bowl attractive then go to the description box quickly and click on alshan.in You can also place your orders on Shopdop's Instagram handle Like and share this video. Thank you!  ", "e3ETJDKd2f8": "Friends of #smokin' ! Hello and Welcome to our second episode of Smoked Fruit Ninja On today's episode we have the Grapefruit The grapefruit from the citrus family provides a unique taste on our session and we can take advantage of that by using this unique fruity grapefruit taste Lets start, and like our other fruits we cut the fruit from the top After our cut is ready we need to drill a hole in the grapefruit's center which will help us to prepare our cavity we need to drill a straight hole about 90 degrees Now by using the carving knife we create a round cavity in our grapefruit we start creating the cavity with our knife we the depth of our cavity depends on the amount of tobacco you are going to use the cavity's diameter needs to be about 7 - 7,5 cm like our HMD our cavity needs to look like this and next we are going to use toothpicks to create a barrier beyond the cavity and above the hole Because the grapefruit is a juicy fruit we are using napkins to dry it a bit simply dry your grapefruit and the place a napkin inside and leave it for a short time I think our crew wants to eat our grapefruit now we are going to place our toothpicks to create as i said a barrier to contain the tobacco you want more grapfruit?;p Our grapefruit is ready now we need to dry our tobacco because our grapefruit is already juicy enough and we need to restrict the juices from it and the tobacco also but that also depends on what tobacco brand you are using if your tobacco is juicy too, i recommend to use a napkin to dry it a bit there aren't big leaves in our tobacco so its not necessary to chop it but we need to dry it a bit our tobacco is ready as you can see the toothpicks are placed in the cavity's bottom we fluff pack the tobacco in the bowl and we can fill it until the top if we want at this point by using a toothpick we create a hole in the center of the bowl in order to have a better airflow and help the tobacco cook evenly our grapefruit is ready, we place it on our hookah we need to check if our grapefruit is in a straight line today we are using a Kaya block in order to see its performance I am going to ask our crew to bring us the kaya block which we already pre-heated and placed the coals thank you very much we place the cover The grapefruit's longevity in general is really good but depends o the amount of tobacco you use how long it will last A positive thing about grapefruit which always elate me is that the HMD will stay as it is in other situations like the apple head which we did on previous episode you may need to clean more the HMD after the session On citrus fruits in general because you have a hard zest you HMD will clean more easily Our hookah is ready because we pre-heated the KAYA block we didn't had to wait long The grapefruit indeed provides a unique taste the clouds density its good enough and during the next minutes you are going to have more dense clouds Thanks a lot for watching don't forget to subscribe and leave your comments below and SMOKE ON!", "inDWHnzFNsU": "me", "QW2a7J2rrZ0": "what's up and welcome back to my channel I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to get Big Smoke so stay tuned so yeah I know we still in coroutine I had to put my gloves on just in case I don't know but I'm gonna start off by cutting a circle at the top of the grapefruit and the way that you cut you want to have the knife going downward on an angle once we're finished cutting the top other grapefruit take the top piece off and if there's any extra grapefruit pieces just pick it off because you want the flavor to sit nicely on top right now I'm just draining the juice from the grapefruit so it won't be like this whole wet mess and then I'm going to flip the grapefruit on the opposite side once you flip the grapefruit over you just want to cut a small square at the bottom so you can stand the grapefruit on top once you make a square at the bottom stick your finger through the square and through the grapefruit just so you can get like a nice clean filter of ear going through I feel as though this part is just as important because you want to make sure you have a nice see-through hole so you can get you know a good smoke flow through the grapefruit from the hookah we're gonna move on and add the flavor I got blueberry mint because I am obsessed with a very mint believe me comments down below let me know what's your favorite flavor [Music] as we add the flavor you just want to make sure you keep your finger through the hole that you made so you just want all of the flavor to cover the top of the grapefruit we are just going to continue to add more flavor until the top of the grapefruit is covered and I hope everyone is doing ok because this is a really weird time and I just can't wait until the coronavirus blows over so we can have our summer and smoke hookah all summer 2020 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after we finish adding the flavor on top I went ahead and purchased this pre potable aluminum foil from a small shop that is still open to my hometown as you can see I just literally place along the foil on top of the grief route [Music] and I just took the toothpick and went over the holes to make sure that they were open if you don't have access to buying pre poked a little before you then I recommend you get real a little moon for you and place it on top and poke holes with an earring back or a toothpick or just something pointy and sharp as you add the holes to the aluminum foil you want to make sure that you go in circles until the circle gets small and then you just have many dots in the middle if that makes sense the goal is to have enough small poked holes and a loom before you because if not no smoke is going to be able to get through [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay it's almost time to smoke the hookah so we're gonna add our coal I'm so excited I usually add three pieces of coal for a lot of smoke but I think for this video I just add two pieces of coal which does the job just fine before we smoke our hookah just little disclaimer do not smoke the hookah when it's just freshly lit make sure that you have the cold turn a little gray before you actually smoke it so I probably let my hookah sit for a good ten minutes after I was like blowing on the coal to make sure that it was burning and I wasn't inhaling the coal in that state and that's it we get to finally smoke the hookah and enjoy ourselves this is my favorite part I hope this video helped you out a lot if you have any questions or comments leave them down below of course and don't forget to like this video and subscribe share this video with the friends so we can all smoke we'll get together and coroutine I'll see you guys in the next one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",

and I for sure enough I picked a bad one to have serrated same muscle blowing event uh-huh that's serrated so what you want to do a little hot okay Austin Becker but you want to get choose the side that you want to cut and go for the bottom by pop that open I cut a decent sized hole what go ahead and put mister what did I do with my finger I held deep I want the hole to be up there right hit until there so then I kick it out really well up you quit right through try to catch some dirt as possible on the goon like that okay I'll never do is why do I always have it go there I wiggle it around like on both in then okay so that's our discussion but now it's no you could put whatever you need in there whatever you left not just do that I knew you might get some juice in your mouth because the that's what they don't mostly known for of course like this is a disposable thing you can't you could throw it if you if you if it's that bad you can eat it get away with it and I feel

[Applause] [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] times [Music] [Music] you", "ulH_WTU3iyU": "hello and welcome to another suburban song video but today instead of drinking wine we're going to be making a sangria here in north america it's late march which means we're welcoming spring and warmer days ahead and it's a perfect kind of day to drink a rose or sangria and spend some time outside and that's exactly what we're going to do what i like about sangria is that it's so easy to make very versatile and you can probably make it with stuff that you have around the house we're going to make a semi-traditional sangria today a red wine sangria a purist would tell you have to use a spanish red like a tempranillo we are actually going to be using a california red blend you can also make them with whites although i would say probably steer toward your sawmill blanks or pinot gris chardonnays tend to be a little too full bodied and oaky i think they would overpower the fruit but you could certainly use the other whites so what we're going to do actually with the sangria you just want to make sure you have fruit some way to sweeten it some way to fortify it and then your wine you can do other things and i'm going to be showing you those right now so fruit wise a traditional one is is apple and sliced orange you could also use lemons you could use grapefruits i i suppose you could use blueberries strawberries raspberries uh again anything you got around the house you could probably use so what we're going to start doing is put our fruit in there and our sweetener now traditional sangrias will either be white granulated sugar or brown sugar you can also use simple syrup you could use agave nectar i'm actually using this monk fruit sweetener and you're going to want to use a quarter cup of that and this is to taste you might want a little sweeter you might want it less sweet the reason we use this and i'm really hooked on this monk fruit sweetener it works a lot like sugar if you're in recipes or whatever you're trying to sweeten up it's a one for one cooks really nice uh but zero carbs we're not keto but we do try to watch our carbs and this is a really really nice product for somebody who has that kind of lifestyle so we're going to use it in this recipe and the first thing we want to do with just the fruit and the sugar is we're going to kind of mash it together what they say muddle and we're gonna do that for about 30 seconds so if you've ever made a mojito uh you're familiar with the term muddling you know when you put the the mint leaves in there and you're kind of mashing them you're breaking the skins and you're releasing that mint flavor we're kind of doing the same thing we're kind of breaking up that fruit blending it together a little bit just kind of mixing it up so we've kind of done that and and also you should probably be using a real picture i should point out i was informed earlier that our nice glass pitcher was broken and never replaced so i'm using a sun tea container for the purposes of this video so next thing we're going to want to do is fortify it and most people will tell you you're going to fortify it with rum or brandy i'm kind of going to do a mix of things i'm going to use an orange liqueur this grand marnier you could also use like triple sec something like that so i'm going to use a little bit of that just a quarter cup and i'm also going to use a dark rum this here is a tommy bahama rum this is a nice sipping rum it's got a lot of flavors in it you could use any rum if you wanted to use some white rum some bacardi it's fine it's gonna fortify it like i said but uh if you've got a nice dark rum with some interesting flavors like this has it's gonna help out too so we'll get that in there and then what we're gonna do is muddle some more just mash that stuff around for just a bit all right the next thing we want to do is add juice again traditional wand is going to be orange juice you could probably get by with pineapple juice grapefruit juice but like i said traditionalists will tell you orange juice three-fourths of a cup could have done that a little better a little more mixing now normally your last ingredient would be your wine but some people like to add a little effervescence um some little bubbles so they'll do that a number of ways i'll either use some sparkling water and if you haven't been down your sparkling water aisle in your supermarket that's a market that's really taken off there's tons of different brands different flavored sparkling waters you could use those just to kind of freshen it up add a little fizz or if you wanted to use a flavored one you could i actually like to use sparkly wine we had a little leftover from mimosas this morning this is a sparkling rose from california so we're going to throw that in there it's actually about half a bottle you may not need that much but we have it so we're going to put it in there and then the last thing for our second last thing we also need ice but we're gonna go ahead and put our whole bottle of wine this is a screw top this is a piccolo which is a red blend from our friends of peiju in napa it's actually a pretty nice fruity wine easy drinking it's going to work well in this i don't know that i would use a really heavy bolt line like a cab or a syrah but this one should do nicely and pour all that in there looks good so far let's give that a stir now what you're going to want to do at this point is get some ice in there cool this off and ideally if you can afford to you'd probably want to refrigerate this for a good hour or two before you enjoy and that'll let all those flavors kind of combine and really gel together but i'm going to go ahead and just sample it before we do that see what it's like again not the most ideal container for this because you're going to want to be able to get some of that fruit out when you're serving this but let's see what it tastes like [Music] smells very fruity doesn't really smell like the wine did that's good that's um that can get you in trouble if you're sitting out on a sunny day because it's just the right amount of sweetness fruitiness but you've got that kick of the alcohol in there and then what i would recommend you do after you've sampled it is you kind of decide what's the good mix for you is it strong too strong not strong enough if it is too strong you can back that off but you could add water you could have more juice if it's not strong enough of course you can add some of your your liquor your rum or randy or whatever you were using and if it's not sweet enough go ahead and add a little sweetener i wouldn't go too overboard on that though because again then it'll make you think that you need to sit out here and pound this but this is actually really really good i can't wait to sit outside and enjoy this all afternoon so that's it that's a simple sangria really really fun to do on a spring or summer day something you can have fun with you can experiment with like i said all the different types of wines the fruits or the add-ons it's really endless possibilities so give it a try sometime and if you do tell me about it in the comments so please like and subscribe and again i'm scott from suburban song and this is what i'm drinking today", "iZJQZeCThns": "welcome to the simple accessories simple one hitter and dugout instructional video I'm going to walk you through how to use the simple one hitter and dugout what comes in the package is two different items the first one is the manual that gives you a step-by-step on best uses you can always check simple dot AC / one-hitter for more details second item that comes in the package is the actual one hitter and dugout you can see the one hitter is an innovative knotch different design with a tapered edge and the white ring you have an adjustable slider that tells you how big your hit will be just also have your little convenient poker that is multifaceted now we're gonna show you how to use the product simply take off the cap you put in this tee position you need to put on either side then you take out the one hitter you know which side to load based off of the tapered edge and then also the little edgings the smaller etchings point which side to load you know what's n to smoke out of based off the white ring the simple one hitter is adjustable look at the adjusting slider on the top and you can have between one to four notches this would be a one notch er you could tell by the edge of the slider or you can pull it all the way back for four notch are at point two grams or the one notch are at point o 8 grams to load your product you can do one of two ways you have the stab and twist we just go in and twist the product around that's it or you can do the scrape and drag where you going at a 45 degree angle scrape along the bottom as well after loading your product put your mouth on the blecch with the white ring and then light from this end inhale with the flame over on this side and then when you're done you can simply push the slider all the way to the edge or you can see it coming out and you can use the included poker to ripe off the edge lastly when you need to clean the product maybe you're having a little restricted airflow issue you can just bring the poker in here and make sure to drag it out make sure not to push it in now we're going to show you some of the best tips and tricks to ensure you get the best use after repeated use the slider can sometimes be hard to move the best way to loosen it up simply use the flame heat it up and it will now make the slider way easier to move but that indicates they should probably give it a deep clean and we'll show you later in the video how to do that for different air flows you can load it with a smaller loading size and after you can simply make the size bigger and you'll have more air for the product to flow through for the dugout instead of holding the cap in your hands you can actually use it put it in this T position to ensure that it's a safe and stored in either side and that still allows you to pull out the one header if you find that some of your product gets too stuck down on the bottom you can always loosen it up and stir it up using the included poker if you're in a pinch you don't have a grinder you can put unground product into the little storage container and just chop it up with either the poker or you can even use one header or deep clean you can disassemble the one-hitter all you do is you use the included poker it's actually a screwdriver you put it in to where the slider is and then you just rotate nice and easy along it you just want to make sure you get all the rotations out and you just simply take out the little screw and then metal adjuster piece then what you do from here is you just push out on the bottom see that there's two different pieces now all four of these pieces you now soak in isopropyl alcohol to reassemble the one-hitter you want to make sure to put the ball bearing side this won't put that ball bearing side to match up with where you put your mouth so you push it through you also want to make sure this lighter opening is available for you to put the little slider piece in and after you did make sure you set it down put the screw in and then just screw it back in righty tighty lefty loosey then you're good to go put it back in the dugout you're good to go", "2oxAMdJ6uSo": "six steps to using and cleaning a chillum step one take contents out of the pack

again!\nToday s lesson will cover everything you need to know about preparing a hookah using a grapefruit\nas a bowl. In order to choose the bowl that will satisfy your taste buds, you will need\nto figure out what type of grapefruit you re going to use. I recommend two types of\ngrapefruits: the traditional red grapefruit or the grapefruit commonly referred to as\noroblanco or the sweetie grapefruit. I am personally a big fan of the sweetie grapefruit\nbecause of its symmetrical shape, tough consistency and its very unique taste. However, since\nthe sweetie grapefruit is lesson common, we will use the red grapefruit for the purposes\nof today s demonstration. To begin, make sure you have a sharp cutting\nknife- once you have that, take the knife and make careful incision at the widest part\nof the grapefruit. Next, take an apple corer and make a neat, perpendicular and remove\nthe center core from one half of the grapefruit. After the core is removed, proceed to removing\nthe fruit from one half of the grapefruit to make room for the tobacco. When cutting\nout the fruit, make sure to do it carefully with multiple slices as to not deform the\ngrapefruit. Make sure you do not throw the grapefruit pulp away as you will need it to\ncontinue the bowl preparation- wow- that s tasty! Now, take some paper towels and remove the\nexcess juice from the cut area of the grapefruit. After you ve removed the excess juice, roll\nup a paper towel and stuff it in the portion of the grapefruit that was removed by the\napple corer. Finally, pack the grapefruit bowl with some more paper towels to absorb\nany remaining juices. By now, you should have your favorite tobacco\nready. Take your desired tobacco and place it on a paper towel, roll it up and drain\nthe excess juices contained within the tobacco. Once the juice is drained, take a sharp knife\nand cut up the tobacco to make the shish airy and light- the tobacco is now ready. Next, take a tall glass; remove the paper\ntowels from the bowl and place the grapefruit bowl on top of the glass. Cut off a piece\nof a metal dish scrubber and make a net out of it. As you insert the tobacco, pat it down\nand leave approximately five to seven millimeters between the tobacco and top of the grapefruit\nbowl. With your index finger, create a hole in the middle of the bowl. Once the hole is\ncreated, grab a piece of aluminum foil carefully place it over the grapefruit. After the foil\ncovers the head of the grapefruit, use the handle of the knife to smooth out the foil\nover the circumference of the bowl. After the foil completely and smoothly covering\nthe bowl, take a push pin and poke holes in a circle, avoiding puncturing holes in the\ncenter of the bowl. When that step is completed, punch two holes through the aluminum, but\nalso puncturing the side topside of grapefruit. Next, remove the foil and with a pair of scissors,\ncut all the excess aluminum foil. When putting it back on, the two holes in the grapefruit\nthat you punched will help you align the foil back on the bowl. Once your foil is padded\nback on tightly, your grapefruit bowl is ready! Go ahead and place your finished bowl on the\nhookah s shaft. As you prepare your coals, keep in mind that the size of your bowl will\ndetermine the number of coals you will need for a smooth smoking experience. You ll know that your hookah is ready to smoke\nbased on the taste of the hookah itself, the amount of smoke and the ease of inhaling the\nhookah. In the next episode, we will demonstrate how\nto prepare the grapefruit bowl specifically for nightclubs, restaurants and lounges. If you have any questions, feel free to contact\nus. Yours truly,\nHookahBoss", "vBC6qrq0ZAg": "ready go ahead I do a folks this is episode one of George these Buca sesh alright we're here with some tobacco we got the hukum behind us and now we're gonna

week for the upside of smoking the head", "DaA7YjfcAb0": "what's up people jabo ic1 gamer here and today I have a special something I know in some of my past segments I talked about you know finding pieces that are relatively cheap that are efficient and I haven't showed another piece in a while well today we have the og Chilam now I was looking these up online I got these down a muggles store down the street from here but they just got these end these are dope as [ __ ] it's a one-hitter got a packed up I'll show you what does dude this thing conserves usually get about ten eleven hits off of something like this so you got that oh gee or went on it works awesome but you can actually find these online just type in ojii-chan women's you can get them those it simply anywhere from 99 cents to five bucks now I'm not gonna lie spend five bucks online but like I said it was at the store so but you know if you got a 99 cent piece after shipping and everything it might come close to five bucks so yeah the thing actually fits it'll fit once in it too so we had once like this my brooch from yesterday so yeah go get this work ya know you give one say a different high but it's not real intense you kind of gradually get a highs alike it gradually just you know creeps up on you you can take a hit by hit versus me up you smoked some really dank ass [ __ ] and you take a rip of big-ass [ __ ] bong or gravity bong or whatnot and it's a yeah sometimes you end up feeling like oh my god I shouldn't smoke that much or what huh well good thing about these little children is we actually keep it c1 you know hopefully about 4 inches long so when it hits us again male OG chillin so the my city place cling it and the holes just small enough to where you're like I'll break it ashes my mouth nope you won't get ashes in your mouth unless you guys try to power in it but these things are perfect very no grab-and-go pieces for those that like to be discreet these are very discreet so I highly recommend OG gems it's actually pretty decent glass like it's pretty big probably being flat bucks so I do have another piece I'm going to show tomorrow but yeah it's really cool actually it's another one of those five six dollar pieces so and it's easily consumable as well but that one's like wood and metal missus class so that's all I have for right now guys you will at any time if you'd

"mC8Z994mLJc": "oh hey guys what's up its mar 6 and this is the hot box two or three depending on if the first two that really could not my to delete that might have been the largely difference so let me catch this real quick before I get started so um actually I'm just gonna close out [ __ ] I'm feeling joking one second nice a clean play this one week [ __ ] is already getting dirty filthy what the [ __ ] Oh cleaner out so this is the hot box blog for just the hot box um this weekend I got some special guests showing up sorry I I was looking at that but the cameras right there so I got some special guests coming up and my special guess I just need some of my friends but and i'm assuming just right now by talking there's someone that will see this eventually I'm not I know right now on youtube I got a bunch of videos and like [ __ ] novias but whatever you know maybe he'll catch on I'm just doing this for fun just doing this for me just cuz I feel like it oh yeah get that oh my god just just get all you get a little bit ball ah no don't spill dude god damn it alright so this is the only problem with me and packing weed and the reason I can't roll I had cancer when I was 16 bone cancer Ewing sarcoma bad [ __ ] um better now next year I'll be in my 10 years it's all be cured but uh my right dominant hand I mean look at this [ __ ] look I can't close my fingers like okay you see this like they want and yeah so it leads to pot everywhere just everywhere but the good part about that is when I'm running low on bud I can I just brushed off in the car and I keep my car relatively clean so I brush it off we'll find it later sometimes they can find it not that's the best feeling in the world when you're looking for it and you're like God I don't got any money until next week but I just gotta do something to get through today [ __ ] find a nug in your garden what's our [ __ ] out of it alright so oh pardon me so what bi smoking on today well oh the reason was being a video I said all I had a have YouTube red and I have music on it and it plays in the background but apparently doesn't play when you're recording by the way super convenient um if you have a dog or whatever surest oh by the way sir esto works [ __ ] fantast months that's not a product placement so this is what we'd be smoking on oh oh this is some Alabama dream I think which is some blue dream and alabama kush but it leans more towards the alabama kush side blue dream is a lot more dense than that but um unfortunately right now i have it on the front facing camera so i can't really give you that much detail of it but it is a co focus if I put my hand focus on some good [ __ ] it's really crystally it's got like little yeah they're just everywhere huh here's a piece hopefully you guys can see this now this is white the stem is white on this one but that's all the crystals so if you guys can kindan sorry dark anyways but it's pretty [ __ ] good at you my uh it's ridiculous not some of the best i've had but a pretty [ __ ] good tasting and i'm pretty sure this is Earth grow although most earth groans Tim have like darker colors excuse me while I huh stroke while trying to put this cap back on this airtight container oh yeah by the way this container is automatically sealed because it is by a bigger people that make aspirin so keeps smelling very useful especially if you have to spend eighty dollars on that or in my case I got it on sale at petsmart shout at petsmart for 65 bucks but that's for eight months so less than ten bucks a month and I can reuse the case alright well cheers guys oh that first hit morning god damn every [ __ ] time I'm not actually hotboxing this morning so in my car down beautiful park if the other video hasn't come out in this is this will be hot box two instead of three I was here same place for that one but um yeah no one comes down here really and it's just it's down out of the way off the road it was a little dirt road going to it and it's really I love this time of year because all the leaves have fallen off and it just it looks like fall you know with all the like the gray looking like leafless trees it's really cool but um so something weird to happen yesterday oh I went to a gas station yeah I guess okay so this is gonna sound even more suspicious but you know I was like [ __ ] I'll give it a try because where I live it isn't technically illegal for everybody it but uh if any of you guys know what this is it is Oh focus just chill CBD oil and it comes in little piggy by with it even after this is jungle juice flavor but I came I picked it up at a gas station and it says it's CBD oil it says the only ingredients are CBD oil VG which is vegetable glycerin which is used in any bait it's just a thickener into the filler for it to get it to bait and artificial flavoring for the suppose it blueberries raspberries apples pine apples oranges yeah I honestly it doesn't taste me but my mouth might just be and gone to [ __ ] and not be able to pick that up because I smoke so often but um ya know before um there was no one else in there and it was just me and this guy talking and I'm like dude is that actual CBD oil and he was a yam and it is no Mike I've always wanted to try that because you know from the cancer I have an amputation which this last October I just had to have my leg shortened another four and a half inches so I'm basically just almost a year out of out of that and by last October yeah not this previous October but the one before that and so it's just been a year first year when you get a new mutation is just [ __ ] awful but I'm doing good can't complain you know I could be dead or you know I could actually be crippled or something but anyways we were talking I told him you know I got that knee pain even when I smoke it doesn't really take care of it it just kind of how do I say this it doesn't so much take care of it it just makes you ignore it whereas something like tram at all which is an SSRI and reliever that helps me amazingly come on neurontin which is gabapentin for nerve pain so if you got nerve pain that's perfect for that I mean advil we just doesn't do the same thing as those do for me and it never has and it's kind of disappointed me but you know I'm not gonna knock that it has medicinal properties it helps with my it helps so much more with my anxiety than anything they've given me helps more than you know One Bowl of this helps more than xanax or ativan or klonopin clonazepam whatever you want to call it but um so I saw a CBD oil and I was like [ __ ] everybody says that's like supposed to be the [ __ ] well he says he has to leave he has to let you try it and you have to wait like five minutes before you um can really feel it because that'll be heading towards the peak of it at 10 minutes I think so about two minutes you started feeling 10 minutes you should be a peek but um yes it's just it's just a vape pen um didn't taste like anything didn't feel anything in my lungs it felt like 0 mg they blew it which is a vaporizer or e-cig fluid without any nicotine the nicotine for people like me who don't smoke or have like radiated my lungs at radiation so I have sensitive lungs which makes smoking a problem but interesting side story real quick the more i smoke the less i cough once i've smoked one bowl and I've like cough my lungs up and [ __ ] I like stop coughing it's it's the greatest [ __ ] thing ever so after I get after i get baked i can just smoke as much as I want and just not even give a [ __ ] anymore but uh I always feel like an like a little [ __ ] cuz people pass me the blood and i'll hit it and i'll get a big hit but you know I'll choke for like five minutes but then after that if I just you know chill and drink something and cool off my throat I come back and they're like what the [ __ ] but anyways so yeah it didn't taste like anything it was there was no burn there was no feeling to it it was just paper um so I got my bottle water in my beef jerky and I went out and I just sat in the car you know just having a parking lot with the windows down just chilled and five minutes rolls around and I realized my me and my hip weren't hurting and I was like what the [ __ ] it was amazing so I was like okay so I go back in there and I you know we talk about it some more and i buy it it's stupid expensive for the pen just for the one ml of fluid of CBD oil it's 65 bucks so I was like [ __ ] whatever it helped me and um I get home and you know I look it up online it's just chill products and I look at the graph they have of what it contains and by then I'm starting to feel like a little like lightheaded so I'm like what the [ __ ] that's not more you shouldn't feel a CBD I ever and I was like there's something else in here so i will just say right now I'm not allegedly according to me I might just be sensitive or my anxiety might just be so bad that when I smoke CBD oil that it relaxes me enough to the point where it seems like I'm high because it felt very much like an ativan or a clonazepam for me so that might have just been me I wasn't eat and that's the thing about the placebo effect which is the effect where you give someone you know a pill full of sugar and you tell them that it will you know make their hips up her even they're like oh my god it my hip stopped hurting it's amazing it's just a fake effect but I went into it not expecting it to work I went I expected it to be fake I was like all right this is [ __ ] you know regular weed doesn't help so how is this can help but I'll give it a shot you know it was a free try and it helped but yeah I don't know man I I don't think that graph on their website is very accurate I'll just say that right now I personally got what felt like a pretty heavy buzz from two puffs on when I got home and I had my friend my brother's girlfriend come over and had her try it and she did three puffs on it and she said she didn't feel anything at first but then she said she felt kind of lightheaded weird so I I don't know anyways Cheers Oh whoo sorry I'm just trying to take that in [ __ ] this thing well where are you put in my mom no no that's weird I'll find it but um sorry I was looking for my little quartz crystal one-hitter that looks like cigarette I was gonna say well those types of one hairs or small bowls work great for me personally it's a hot and harsh but and I don't really get a good hit but with this style of chillin pipe whatever you want to call it um I haven't had anybody be very disappointed with this has cost me ten bucks and I was like well you know it's okay it worked it's small enough where I can hide it but it's also very it's very thick as you can see it's very thick all the way around and then this part I don't know if you'd be able to see it the bowl is right here above my finger and then it kind of our glasses and then it goes bigger here but all of this around it that little space in our glass is solid glass so I've dropped this a couple times and nothing's happened and it doesn't get hot the end gets hot the ballpark it's hot but has a really deep Bowl um the only downside is did I just [ __ ] like no I do it was my lighter goddamn I am I out of it already downside of this is it gets dirty very easily very quickly once you see isn't it it's great it looks a lot through before you season it which is you know to be expected of smooth glass or any glass in general metal tends to do a better job because the metal will heat up and kind of melt it together so that that takes care of that I didn't really have to season the quartz crystal one because again it's like the metal it heated up and kind of melted all the residue to it so you don't really get that but this was gross um but this thing hits so [ __ ] hard I don't know how and I don't know why I nobody's been disappointed with it that's for sure so I don't know what it is but just enjoy it and i think i [ __ ] up a little bit because i am totally [ __ ] baked off of two hits because i'm an [ __ ] and decided oh yeah well I'm just gonna I'm gonna take this ad D medication focalin this morning and I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna be productive without the buck but and then I'm like oh yeah I can you know smoke bowl while I'm on my vocal in because you know keeps you awake and you get to experience a lot i sorry I was just staring at the cars going by see how I'm [ __ ] out of it but uh if you want an intense experience take a focal in wait an hour smoke oh oh if you have hard issues I wouldn't try it because focalin speeds up your heart rate interesting fact just because I'm full of useless information and love to hear myself talk um focalin is like dimethyl een something well adderall and Ritalin are impediment salts so this is what I found out in my research of it when he prescribed when my doctor prescribed consuming which it helps it is absolute godsend my burden is so [ __ ] up after all the drugs and buy drugs I mean actual drugs that the hospital had me on like all the chemo all the you know the [ __ ] they inject in you all the painkillers I was on I was 16 and 17 and 18 on 80 milligrams of MS contin which is the hawk oxycontin kind of similar thing but it's morphine morphine sulfate cotton and I was on 80 milligrams twice a day and taking eight milligrams of dilaudid every four hours and taking advil and tylenol at regular intervals to deal with the bone bang and yeah I suffered withdrawal from that because I missed once it'd be one single dose of that ms cotton and I thought I was dying we're stomach pain I've ever felt shaking this is it 17 so keep that in mind I'm already bald and you know fighting cancer and sick from that and then all of a sudden I miss a dose and then the next day I'm just like sweaty and vomiting and throwing it vomiting I was [ __ ] myself too I was throwing up so hard that I started throwing up blood because my stomach lining was coming up and anyways that that tripping that ended in a trip to the hospital where they had to inject me with the lot in every two hours for about Oh half a day and then they kept me and pump me full of fluids because I got dehydrated but uh yeah so all that [ __ ] and then they and I had to go on methadone you know [ __ ] thing but oh yeah so all that [ __ ] kind of [ __ ] with my brain because it turns out when you're going through puberty and you give kids chemo and pain medications even though they need it and it helped and it did what it was supposed to do I don't blame him I don't blame the medicine it worked it's just I wish there had been something better so but um it turns out when you're going through puberty in your brains developing fastest when that [ __ ] happens it [ __ ] with you and I was a straight-a student you know I read a lot after chemo I couldn't focus long enough to read a book I couldn't remember stuff in five minutes ago I it literally felt like I had to mention but um focalin I tried strattera vyvanse Ritalin Adderall and none of it worked and then this one guy this one doctor prescribed me I'm focalin and it worked but uh I don't work for everybody but that's just my story but that's why I researched and turns it up focalin reacts with your body like cocaine does while all the other a TD medications made with amphetamine salts are basically just meth and minerals that's it that's all they are it's just methamphetamine and minerals go figure just all you crack is just just a matter how [ __ ] get the salt out of it they catch him up don't [ __ ] do that I might believe that chemically that I'm [ __ ] stoned I still got a bowl you know feel kind of stupid sitting here talking to this not known if anybody's ever gonna even see this but you know what I've kept myself isolated I've kept myself closed off because I was so afraid of what everybody thought and you know what [ __ ] it this is going out there this is this is me I'm putting myself out there and even if nobody sees this it'll be for me so yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and then close it out if you watch this I appreciate it like dislike you know call me a [ __ ] fat ass you know whatever I understand we all have bad days you need event on somebody you know vent on me I it won't bother me seriously so you know if that makes you feel better call me a [ __ ] fat ass or cry baby or call me if I get whatever if that helps you go ahead but uh yeah guys I think this is not so much for an audience as it is for me but you know if it turns into an audience that would be amazing because maybe I could help somebody that's gone through some [ __ ] you know helping one person would be worth it so I'm gonna keep uploading these hot box videos I'm going to get some friends in here we're gonna be you know doing it chatting it up and see where it goes you know I can even use this as an opportunity just to be like hey man would

hours walk distance from here and hopefully that walk in the morning well you know wake me up it's a bit windy sings giving dinner on let's cancel they know it's back on again so yeah I'll be enjoying

chilling not a bad piece at all this came in for me at about 99 crowns which is about four bucks so if you're looking for something cheap easy discrete definitely check it out all alright see you next time peace", "q9O47u3ZhaA": "yeah I'm on a different part because I'm going for different location this is second day of work I do not have time to do a video on the first day after all I wanted to make sure I got there on time but it's walking distance from where I live the difference between taking a bus and this walking is only about 10 minutes or so and that it's not going to be waiting for the bus and it's not a full-time job yet anyways like Prince acting buggy [Music] I swear I need to change the three tardies like at least once every week and a half it's not more Oh lightning yeah it's raining fortunately I'm in the my bonus later I don't see that dead now dammit oh wow light blue light like dammit come on I have plenty of time tried to go to work I stink anyways so that's it I am new so I'm expected to school early along some sort of cheese factory for you I'm working through manufacturing again which means unicorns and hearing it fun but yeah I am 36 pages but less than 36 pages away from editing the buckling I am primary it let when I expect to have a son possibly as I said I worked yesterday so I only got a few pages done and I worked today but I got a few cuts done as I said I'm that's up his bowl and there I'm working tomorrow so we'll be able to get as much done as I normally Walt likes Friday I think I have off the 10th AGC said they only needed me from Tuesday to Thursday and that if the factory needs me you know money's money and so and it's an odd shift eight and a half hours you get a half-hour break for lunch but it's not paid for but you do work a full 8-hour day so it's better than coming that plus I get more money about $1 more money a network that's where dinner shift is set up is you work four hours straight has a beginning and it drags then after a little under four hours but three hours and 55 minutes you get a 15-minute break but it's really 20 minutes because it give you five minutes to change out of your uniform and the like then you got a breakout lunch what's around eight okay that's a half hour hour and a half two hours and you're home jerk my family behind my phone so it was a day goes by relatively put me on you despite the initial fare our beginning but it does go by fast because they was yesterday had me doing consistent work not Elektra later again don't ever mind it's wet think about pre-celebrate is it stays lit relatively well it's consistent city work so the days always by fast the people there seem to be nice no mine once supervisor has been what was at the beginning anyways that's me as a hawk but I am new who wanted to make sure I wasn't up too badly what time is that hurry up from your time so yeah it's you know extra money I get paid I sink 12 to the are over 12 bucks an hour I think it's 1285 might be less got it's more than I was earning at karma candy through the hours are guaranteed pretty much I show up for work I'm half face that I'm not going to be sent home because my team is down well it's coming candy I show up oh we haven't work for you go home well okay then where we live work for you but it's you know spend all the time doing nothing staring at a wall for footing for Alexis to turn on so you can work and you know an eight-hour day and Greg when you're doing nothing so yeah it's night job per se it's work through a temp agency but work pays and they seem desperately need for new people so whether or not I return Friday I don't know it depends on whether or not they mean me whether or not I return next week I don't know it depends on whether or not they need me or want me I shouldn't say but I was the only temp that showed up and there was supposed to be four people showing up I was the only one that showed up so you know that probably gives me a bonus system like the ability I showed up and I'm showing up today when I stayed for the entire shift and in complaint or anything go work so it's easy but it's hard you know I don't need to work out awkward because I'm lifting like 20 kilo boxes like hundreds of them at a time so I'm getting a decent upper body work there - I went sore afterwards slept like a baby anyways I'm going to end this now upload it when I return home currently after eleven pictures everybody how this looks good day and bye", "tlkxn3OPHRY": "this is John with hookah chong kham here today I get two very special

elastic of lomasa motion above majority okay hookah bar said if I'm gonna talk too much in this video he's gonna take that knife and check me with it yeah hookah both said like because this knife right he's a simple like steak knife is the best of all to cut the fruit inside you ready easy to use and I like this time what do you call this like a potato knife the one that he used to make the whole kind of knife for Apple it's kind of to cut meat Oh Apple like a boring knife I don't know what you call it exactly device until here guys the customers love to hate remember Sophia took lo something that's up to this is solution your chest should open while you're cutting fruit after you finish we can put some paper towels or napkins inside food have to let it dry a little bit and yeah then we put it away and started reading was known as the wisest of us which was me whooshing no station is your open table my folks at the boy wasn't he knows what interests me no the moon your do not plan we do we won't do it was Lucien alright now we're gonna squeeze some juice from the bottom well now we using stir Buster vodka and it's really juicy about I don't need juice it about going inside your head because it already like we've got some water inside so when are we gonna see how he'll make it she's gonna do it missus what they even mobile development quite give it just means everything yeah today's gonna be a mix of Starbucks Tabata and a little bit of Al Fakher what's the name this is Barry yeah I'll [ __ ] bury and which turkish flavor these is the Blue Mist Blue Mist Hungary he responded even so Blue Mist very Tom berry and cantaloupe cantaloupe yeah Norfolk mission to cut the balance money put the Catalan equal amount of fruits effective promotion but she is the natural version which is calm connections Museum no Willy was loosening now it looks like he's gonna all right looks like he's gonna squeeze out some of the juice yeah maybe to dry it a little bit right ups a little bit we should do this a long time ago a long time ago we actually take a handful and run out of the water in the sink yeah that's too much it takes out too much yeah this is the best way you use a paper towel and it it just takes out a little bit of the juice yeah exactly I don't know if this pineapple is in the way I'm gonna move it so we can see do you need it now what does a new mobile suits is just me yeah shut up no no no sure i mean--' Ibaka is deal when you always boost normally sure you just Michonne to work here we gotta chop it up like you chopped parsley when you make the bullet you guys know what color it is yeah okay when you get the parsley portability you chop it the same way oh okay they have to put it in Russia you know what the mood is yeah probably yes now who the boss is making sure we have enough Barry this is the back porch it's a switch from Savoie wasn't human Gazette save the very funky well it was not a worker algebra you said yeah if while we're cutting the bottom notice that this to dry like always right you can add from a can from a can of tobacco you can add some new fresh one juicy and makes it a little bit now one thing I learned at the show before I never cared for glass hookahs I never cared for too much for fruit bowls but after watching hookah bus do this they got me interested it's very time consuming so I won't do it every day but I'm glad that you're here to show us how to do it and I might do it once in a while because it looks kind of interesting and fun it's a hobby it's not young a quick smoke it's a good presentation is gonna use a lot of tobacco so how long will the fruit bowl last the organist budget which is a chess Papa about sons of Obama's relationship with prostate you do know that those two mostly chests of Khufu the between wheelchairs so for this particular heads you're gonna feel the flavor for one out of one hour and a half but after one hour it starts like yeah you will not feel flavor storage so but anyway Belanger normal tomorrow no specific research in cinemas loosely if the market with octopus pet was do if she chose to move attack on shampoo alone she could show since relates to a fish there's some media is possibly a snowshoeing an additional marketable car we posted the videos miss Manion addition to socket EDM very untypical as the wood sugar as the in series nutrition Smith so to mix it about by declaring it like chocolate it's much better to make the flavors because like always with each other it's not like you mix in with your hand and then I'll see you see me Korean like small pieces so if you have air goes through much weight easily okay so the finer chop makes it easier to get yeah here he and airflow yeah do you scoop honest about me Papa don't the audience but you like to deal with selfishly either which is polluted we have no dope no more than person you know perfectly what that word what motion is the only series I wish Monsieur Zuko could do it simply put WH the end we do and sip who is what Pope not the false converts in Italy which is [ __ ] hey do you have it straight on the table or out back right now we have steel wool and it's showing us yeah what is gonna be doing with the steel wool okay it is true way to make the battery but to make kinda screen here to net to protect about the polling in downstem yeah so you can use toothpicks is it like it's not the easiest way it's kinda you need to spend my time a little bit to put them in sight is a way best way and the easiest to use metal wolf yeah it's like regular one you can buy it at any grocery store sample impress' I'm this Prince people share photos doing like this that should not be gone bo-zone all right go get steel wool and cutting it to the right specifications how long describes it too much you guys can see it visually here Shanta especially in school the fishtail - yeah you can make after like six heads okay yes so you just keep it in the collection of tools yeah so right now he's putting it in you wanna show the final you're done so you just putting it in the hole so tobacco doesn't fall in actually raises it that steel wool is keeping the space almost like a funnel right did you bring your staple gun yeah we bring it we're gonna like like we're gonna explain how to use a stapler but today we're not gonna use it and I know you're much nicer well you don't actually over here no no I'm gonna show you how to staple gun but no staples in it make it good so as you see guys already fill up with ice now do you have water or genius we have bottled water set up for sewing more yeah yeah get him a couple bottles of water okay I like the way that he's keeping his workplace very clean every time you take the step he cleans up his workspace yeah it's like a chef actually I call him a shisha mixologist yeah he's definitely like mixologist or a chef they're green special muscles are the bullish is doing the bull was already the bowl is completely ready yeah and now like I mean just later we need to call his boil and right now he's caught in a truce to put the bass now was hookah boss a chef before Buca bas no never never chef okay it's simple stuff but he does it precisely and accurately yeah and look he's even taking care to clean out yeah yes no but whatever but is to focus you of is like listening pushes the key man for a tournament and you can cut example the dilution of Thomas - Savino - is conclusive with Marisa taking the inner parts of the orange out so that is juicy yeah I mean it really is a an art form here and there are a lot of little steps that he's taking here that again I may not have the patience to do but you guys might and here we go so watch this carefully and check out a new method there's all these fruit bowl tutorials out there but I have a feeling this is the most complex one I don't watch them too much as I always thought it was simple but this is definitely not simple and the guy needs an assistant - you're gonna need someone in the background to help them up push the way to a professional dessert so the solution pasta give us traditional karate make receive how to cut it is this kind of same like achieve do I mean like in our kitchen yet just need to make a recent simple but looks really good then you're using you're spending more money on fruit than you are tobacco yeah I mean like what is nice experience look at lemon lime and orange right now although he's smoking he's trying for the first time Starbuzz Teaberry what do you think about this flavor is really nice interesting ok and then I'm smoking a little bit of Tangiers pinky mix some chocolate and some came in together or no cocoa and came in right yeah ok kiddo right now these differences are just regular one can use olive oil to the camera yeah you can you can use something like this so you can buy it at any grocery store can you show me what it's like before cocktail if you like this so he's using today roses cocktail infusion blue raspberry mix perfect for Asbury martinis is there any alcohol in this mixer no help ok we don't believe in Smash Mouth Google I mean like it's not kind of too healthy [Music] please let everybody see yeah I like the way he does have you made him straight so press it up against the glass yeah yeah guys and one more need to use on the swole advice not like crushed ice right if you're gonna use a crushed ice will be in case you didn't understand that use coal cubed ice if you were to use crushed ice it's gonna make it more restrictive and and you'd rather not you'd rather have more air flow going through what the minions are still means the easiest way she's perfect bartender spoon in also really close yeah yeah and it will be really easy yeah how much when you go to a local lounge in Moscow or st. Petersburg how much does it cost to order a hooker Harry laughs it's normally starts from I can see 20 or it's like it will be the simple gam small small whole collage but if you're going like your really nice book collage you're gonna pay like eighty eight plus eight it gonna be simple care if you want to use art or something is not we set up this price is like price policy in Russia right how about you get this particular hookah made this procedure is gonna take a lot more time and labor yeah and I don't know no way yeah yeah I need to go to Russia to practice my russian my russian accent maybe yeah I'm gonna take you home would you slow but steady ticket with the stop no no that was not easy bunky estate for subtext let us go me and I check you with institution cut-off of state study yeah you put a foil on truth is better to use like a glass or just two cans of tobacco make a foil seats perfect come on the books alright so we're back here and who the boss is putting thumbtacks sighs holes and this is using a thumbtack poke holes yeah it looks like he is doing not all the way to the edges and anything in the middle and nothing to me Oh I'm States ship commercial for it yeah it's like inner flow will will will be good yeah you can use it son hum cake or - speaks whatever you like Keira prefer haunted because it's like long-lasting okay Obama's doing someone [ __ ] - yeah Tribune only beer dude you're making to everybody but don't cook their food are you do it yeah you make two or three balls here I just remember it when I helps you to understand later where you should we should put it okay he's using it for guidance on the next time here's the lid back on or the let's move the wood machinery a tree hold over there okay and you carefully put the back on okay if you wish you can use the stapler to staple the bottom you will not use it today it doesn't mean it's the king Emily yeah I know okay you see how beautiful is perfect size where are the coals hold that here okay so for this particular head you need to use your Krishna when I use like five or six hold all right lunch Alma's not your school uniform in order to avoid the tax take it started hopefully you can use let's say like six or seven and tell you she would not post apologies to the start you can put a quote on th you can put a squirrel and top right to get more here with our target but keep ironing not let it burn Tabata and Google harsh okay so it doesn't look like it's taking too much time I think this is a good tutorial for lounges if they want to use this method and it's a really good way to present to a customer and you keep it on the table top you know where someone's eating rather than on the floor yeah yeah you can mix whatever you like a dream like me or even pledge to take a problem with geometry animo vetoes Richard sir he's telling upon me silica toward me included yet of couse apparently possessed on Google cocaine acetate just called always visuals even of the actress of it this Nikita crap delicate or emotions is Couture a good II would be consumed a mobile ecosystem Laden of course not Islamic regime in Poland whose bosom dislocation rock t no Labuan Vivian Kapoor mother dead of course what is rating process this dress up like that for the plot fantasy Agra nation sister one crushed assumable muscular power it on a voice which is a movie IQ oh you can use two different types how to fuel debate so you can use just to for make it look beautiful but also you can reuse a fruit or some vegetable that can give you a flavor for example you can use the mint if you focus the lives of means and also if you can chop it like in mijita okay a little dough get a little play I'm gonna give you a natural flavor of me okay or you can use the cinema it also will give you a little bit of flavor you can try to make a look okay yeah water hookah yeah hot water it's like it's personal some of you guys liked it just for no ice but hot water yeah yeah before the hot water you could just see but I'm like Chinese tea earning your keep later okay that sounds good yeah but as I said it's really you like it hot hot water hookah okay can we get the lights on too when you get an answer camera and both thank you children initiative yet the plan CDC professionals because given for swiss knife for to the Sun with the Wordsworth without who snippet about now we go it is only based on food you start like feel the heat from the coals and it starts to give a flavor so you will start to feel a pineapple flavor a little bit so I think that the flavor changes throughout your session yeah you see Purdue much was most not the Pokemon you see a new movie in factor structure what we teach is job when you persist on British teacher or any persistent program because they are not renewable yeah it's somebody can say that like air goes through here is not good no it's not true because if will will be hot enough just speaks to the food yeah yeah I was thinking that because there's a it looks a little loose around the edges here but what he's saying is after some time these foil will start sticking to the fruit itself and self seal yeah I know exists yeah this is a it's a good flavor I mean I can't tell other than what the flavors are because it still mix but it's really good and we start to taste a little bit of the fruit now and I think it's done just a little bit more I want to taste that pineapple secret Jorge answer but it's gonna take some time to like this and then it'll last over an hour too so this will be excellent and yeah good flavor and I like it I'm glad that you guys came to choke this store we can smoke this today after we stop fill me up okay then maybe we'll come back and say the flavors maybe we take half an hour break yeah so we come back okay okay yeah guys in a more video coming I'm like problem on your recording is hookah John friends and if you look at for article truck drum carrying them really good service also please check guys burning coal that's really nice we use only them so we'll be back I'm gonna shoot some more in like half an hour take a break it'll come right back alright thanks okay guys so we're back we wait about 20 minutes we did some adjustments he put on a little wind cover that I did himself where he's stapled in the foil it made a little whipped cover and requires a lot of heat depending on the charcoal that you use so we added a little bit more charcoal and put a wind cover in and we put some foil on top and got it nice and hot and now you can tell just by the base here so by the stem you get a lot more smoke and we've got a lot more smoke going to and a lot more flavor to yeah you can see all right so what do you guys try this at home try your different methods for how much heat you need and it depends on the foil that amuse how much you don't double up so it could take a little trial and error for you but it's right now Luca bas did it right and took a box

This is one. A gather of glass has been made \non the end of a metal rod. The edge is being pincered, and at a certain point, the pincered edge is pulled outward, and this begins to draw glass tubing from the reservoir at the end of the metal rod. If it\u2019s pulled quickly, the diameter is small; if it\u2019s pulled slowly, the diameter is greater. When the glass is stiff, the ends are cut. After the tube has cooled, one end is heated in a flame. As the glass softens and becomes less viscous, surface tension causes the edge to round, and eventually the hole closes. When the end has closed, air is blown in the other end and the bulge forms. In at least one example, the heating was stopped too soon, and a tiny hole was left. Here, the hole is almost closed, but not quite. Blowing begins. There\u2019s enough pressure to inflate the glass, but a tiny hole remains on the end.", "BXA1ldkrS2w": "welcome to my YouTube channel in today's video I'm gonna teach you how to make a grapefruit head to start with you got the side that is flatter than the other side so what you should do is to keep that flat side on the bottom then we need to cut just a little bit of the top after you cut it you're gonna move to the second step in which we gotta try to remove a little bit of the fruit itself so we could have a space for that back okay for the second step you need to have your hand 45 degrees and start cutting Circle Circle Circle Circle so cool sir and then pull up and it should go by itself so now you have a space in here for that battle you're gonna just make a little hole in here on the bottom so it go on the top of the hook up now we set the head the second step would be just put two toothpick in here so that tobacco doesn't go down to the war just like this now you could pick any tobacco that you want then we're gonna start spreading so now we're gonna start putting that tobacco in the head for this I chose one of my favourite mixes we're gonna do blue mist with warm LM freeze it's really spreading the tobacco [Music] have that if either one of these [Music] just like the regular tobacco [Music] you wanna try not to have anything in them now the second step would be to put the aluminum foil under the joint part of the aluminum foil and remonstrance course we're gonna put the shiny part on for five just aside now bring you to fix all of them just put them on the sides so it keeps the same last step you're gonna just try to make the holes try to make it even bigger finish doing the grapefruit I will please ask you to like my video and subscribe to my youtube channel", "wOmTcd2dud8": "[Music] today I will be making what is called a one-hitter backhoe pipe slash cigarette holder it's going to be wouldn't that's what I'm making today here we go ready ready all right let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] so obviously I mean maybe it's not so obvious but I don't I don't really know what I'm doing and what I have done up to this point I think is pretty self-explanatory but so basically I got a branch and I cut a piece off and I thinned it out and I drilled a hole through it and then I and that's about as far as I've gotten here so then I started carving it down to like a thinner shape that I wanted it to be in and then I drilled a wider hole at the top you know where the cigarette would fit in or or whatever tobacco you put in it or whatever you know whatever and that's that's just how you make it I'm not great at explaining how to make things but that is how you make it yeah so enjoy the rest of the video I'm probably not gonna I might well you know just yeah that totally made sense all right I'll see you in a bit [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah so to put a finish on it I just used olive oil you can really use literally like pretty much any oil I vegetable oil will work fine or linseed oil is what I believe is usually used it just some sort of oil you can honestly probably use baby oil if you wanted to just just got to make sure you dry it out and everything but yeah that's how I made this so thank you guys so much for watching I really really really appreciate it up to this point this was

we're just gonna do a quick video on how to make a Sherlock pipe out of a carrot stuff so let's get right to it first thing you're gonna need is a carrot obviously I have this carrot stuff that I have in the fridge so I'm just gonna use that I'm gonna try to build it in the top part of the carrot cuz I'm not sure if I'm gonna need to restart you the bottom stuff so I'm just gonna get right to it and start hollowing out this carrot light bulb I mean any typical vegetable peeler you're gonna have a end that's used to take out the eyes of potatoes or gouge stuff out of slightly rock vegetables I'm just gonna get started with that so I've got a nice little gouge started right there that's gonna pretty much be the entire size of the bowl I want to make sure that the walls of the pipe are still pretty thick because I'm going to use the og Chilam for my coke : don't use plastic or a pen or a marker or anything like that unless the pen is metal if you use something that's not metal that's probably gonna melt and you apply the heat to it and then you'll be inhaling plastic fumes which nobody wants so anyways I'm just gonna take these scissors and kind of even out the ball here just like I did in the last carrot quick video Millie if one of the walls a little bit thicker it's just going to give me a little bit of extra room when I go to put the OT Chilam in as the toko so we've done this carrot bowl going on right there now I'm just gonna try to insert this at an angle probably right about right about there somewhere it's probably where it's gonna be best you're gonna want to make sure you start high enough up by the time the stem gets into the bowl apart it's not too far down into the care they dig way down because it's gonna be hard to hit with a lighter in that case we're gonna do a really vague hole just a little bit smaller than the actual diameter of the chilla hopefully that'll give us a pretty nice seal be really careful here or you're probably gonna have to start over this is uh seems to be pretty delicate work I should probably do it you know something that looks just a little bit like that not too bad and the moment of truth I'm gonna take this over each other I'm gonna stick it in that hole of nice angle there you have it it's a nice carry play now this was obviously a really fast and easy version of the carrot fight you're not gonna need to do too much work if you luck out and you happen to have something like this Oh be chillin here or some other kind of metal stem body airway so anyways um let's jimsonweed in there and see how she works now I'm not gonna break it this week too much because some action will screen on the Chilam so I'm just gonna break it up a little bit just enough so it burns nicely and I guess we'll just give it a shot they have guys the carrot pipe part to Sherlock style I'd say quite a little bit easier than the original carrot fight but let's just see how she smokes before we make any quick judgment calls here yeah I don't want to say guys this is version of the carrot pipe really kicks the other ones ass this is definitely the way to go yeah this is pretty awesome I could definitely see making this like if I was out camping if I didn't have a pipe on hand even if you didn't have the Chilam on hand you can always use like like I was saying you could always use a reed that you find in the woods a lot of a lot of plants have a hollow stem you can just crack off and use that as a stick and you'd be good to go although I don't know why you'd have a bag of weed and not have any means to smoke it but this is always an option for you if that ever comes up now again the one drawback with a carrot pipe is because the carrots so watery inside a lot of the weed gets kind of wet and doesn't really burn properly so it actually is a little bit more difficult to like finish off the bowl properly gross you know what this quite reminds me of this sort of level of Stella no part you know what they look like you know this pipe reminds the other it's like one of those old-school corncob pipes see see old men smoking or sitting on the rocking chair it's got kind of a nice feel to it to be honest unfortunately it's a carrot so it's not like you can take this with you and use it more than once but but it's pretty nice alternative to smoking a joint or something like that if you just wanted to throw it down to some friends so I guess let's throw a little bit more reasonable [Music] all right ready guys let's see if I can get this all done in one pull here the bottom of the bowl is getting kind of wet and gnarly in there so we'll see what happens but I'm thinking it'll work out here it's really nice I'm starting to get a little bit of blowback here some chunks flying through the tube but not that many to be honest I'm a little surprised there weren't more so anyways I guess we'll just close it off with a review of the Sherlock style carrot stuff fight I'd say probably the content out of 10 I mean it's really easy to make obviously and as long as you have this here oh gee Chilam you can just whip one up in a matter of seconds really the one drawback I was talking about where your weed gets kind of wet because the carrot juice really salt itself once you start to apply fire to it it really dries it out obviously so that's not really a problem at all you guys want to know a little bit more about the OG Chilam you can check out my review of that right here I'll post a link I guess that's it don't forget to Like comment share subscribe send it to a friend each of vegetables all that good [ __ ] and I guess I'll see you guys later [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "4s6U3AnFSro": "hi everyone how's it going welcome back to our channel where we talk about various hot

incredibly cheap bang for your buck definitely my most recommended tool for improving your experience it does two important things it removes butane from the smoking equations they're not inhaling butane fumes when you're smoking cannabis and it burns at a lower temperature and so terpenes or the the compounds that are aromatic that give cannabis its array of scent and flavor are simple compounds they're very simple and very volatile and they change rapidly under virtually no pressures bic lighter burns much hotter than the flame from my hemp wick which is going to really increase the amount and the purity of flavor that i experience", "OLgQkyUw76U": "I mmm", "43vGdQd9Gug": "today we're talking about two unique pipes the pipe tech prometheus line and the new genius pipes first

a new shipment in but you gotta have some respect for it this place is looking like crap guys we're gonna have to have a little talk later all right where's somebody to hold this thing hold it thank you look John's in a mood today we got trifecta in all right something I've been noticing about you guys lately God the way things have changed over the years social media it used to be cool to like tell people how you really feel but no now everyone's so sensitive it's like no you can't say this that person you can't say this to everyone everyone's so sensitive what happened to the days where people had guts speak the truth I'm gonna go ahead and do it with this right now actually first of all you know what I'm gonna just call someone out right now I'm gonna call someone out I've been looking on videos and I saw something I hear most of my followers are newbies so you guys may not know who this is but true hookah King I've been watching you all these years I've been watching you I may be contacting you I just might have to contact you all right back to business here trifecta hookah tobacco you know that we've had their dark line for a month now doing pretty good now we got what's called a blonde line I don't know if it's actually considered if they even call it a blonde line or some jackass just called it a blonde line doesn't matter what I'm gonna do is go ahead and smell these and choose I can't see the flavors as you can see I smelled a bunch and took some notes but I don't do some notes with you right now see what the smells like so first we get this one whatever it is it ain't grapefruit kind of it's tangy and it is more Oh exist it's got a picture of an orange or maybe a blood orange or a grapefruit like I said all right let's do this one familiar it's citrusy Oh Mountain fog yeah I was gonna guess Mountain fog I I looked at the names but I didn't know but I couldn't say him on phone so Mountain fog is citrusy like another brand you know one thing I think I'm gonna go ahead and can't say anything about the tobacco yet but trifecta being new I am gonna criticize you these tins are garbage man they're like what brand used to use these tins years ago if you're coming new to the game and trifecta is made in the US and I know we got a source packaging from China cuz it's just packaging it's a better packaging dudes this is its weak alright its weak Oh what I'm not supposed to say that John's being too harsh now no seriously I know the people at trifecta good people dark lines pretty good this I haven't tried yet but I don't like these tins hard to get on it's cheap Chinese [ __ ] so change that out so familiar can't tell it's familiar it's like somebody it's like somebody else's version of something else so what is it Oh melon melange you know we've tried this years ago at least a year ago when he brought it over here to try but I haven't sold it so that's my melon that's what it smells like old school hookah tobacco not old school that when hookahs started coming to the US so it's like a familiar flavor again some new brand back in 2008 maybe I don't know I'm not even gonna look Oh VDS like I was gonna guess that okay so the picture is I don't have my glasses but it looks like a peach a banana and a melon so interesting so something to try hey just because I have a funny look on my face when I'm doing this doesn't mean you shouldn't try it a couple of guys here or smelling some that I liked in they hated and vice versa so it happens is this a different one insane BDS different one this isn't the pumpkin one but it's spicy earthy and it is coconut ginger interesting I wish I was more descriptive for you guys I wish I was more descriptive for you guys they said the pumpkins pumpkin I smelled this earlier it's good what's going on here pumpkin something it is real CD pumpkin CD so it's not sweet pumpkin get a little cinnamon like you would in a pumpkin and a pumpkin something maybe a little cinnamon I'm interested in this one alright and it is the fall season so yeah and I did have pumpkin pie this morning okay now it's all messed up there's a mint in here something else blue strawberry I wasn't gonna guess that cuz I didn't really study the names so I get something that makes sense here see if I can guess anything good a mint pleasant mint not overbearing not like an Al Fakher mint kind of like a spearmint stuck at my nose this one are we gonna choose Mediterranean oh no this is it twice the ice extreme extreme hold on did we foot is one of these a twice the ice regular nope okay well I'd like to compare it to twice the ice regular but you guys can do that you can comment and get on hookah john circle friends and go ahead and share your experiences so let's see this one spicy and kind of cool clovie did it hey aunt anthony does this remind you something it's clove it's jazz not jasmine Earl Grey Earl Grey I love you Earl Grey people that's what it's just Earl Grey

isn't the entire line but it's both of them who Apple 509 they got a picture of a martini I think I don't know can you see that this picture it's just color now it looks like something looks like a drinker that on the L when it's it on the elbow it's an apple core check my prescription again this is the minty one this is the Mediterranean mint it's a difference a little flavor in here this is like a straight strong spearmint a cooling real cooling this is cooling too when it's got a nice flavor to it a nice I don't know what would Mediterranean Beach I should know I'm part Mediterranean

discontinue all right talk about enough little later nope don't try that Mediterranean mint being that I'm parked Mediterranean and all see I'm probably full minute remaining I've swam in the Mediterranean I like Mediterranean food and I like men but everyone's got a mint I'm sick of mint straight mint I'm sick of it I want to do a mint another [ __ ] this is the pumpkin one right no it's not I don't want to do this one this is the coconut ginger which sounds interesting is the where is it I mix them all up don't want to do it the one I want I want to be blown away BDS wants something

was more of a pink grapefruit kind someone in your hand this is it I'm gonna go with this alright I'll be actually let me show you this before we do that you get a you need to see what it looks like okay oh I get a nice bro I get a nice who would call this blonde there's nothing blonde about it not even dirty blonde and I change the description on the website now alright this is for my buddy Mike out in Ohio saw you the other day dude your and I ordered that thing alright guys just representing out there I mean this dog like your dog bro didn't even flinch the dog didn't flinch even when you're like whoa whoa whatever with your stick that was awesome that was funny nobody knows what I'm talking about except for him maybe a couple other people who okay is that blonde too you know like a dirty blonde it's pretty brown who cares um you know when they start mixing the hookah tobacco with what you know it comes yeah there's different colors but when you get all wet like this it does tend to get darker so maybe it is a light a light tobacco before they add all the liquid to it that would be the flavoring in the glycerin and whatever base they're using okay that's right I'm gonna put it in a hookah Jon Farriss Bowl air is full and I'm gonna do a light pack I'm just gonna go like that want to do it from the top don't you kill me from the top Faris full you get the top there the lighting is good in here uh guys stay tuned a hookah John we are going to have a hookah Expo this year just like the ones they have in Brazil just like the ones that have in Europe bring it to the US hosted and sponsored by cuca John make sure you're on hookah John circle of friends on Facebook and you will be a part of it all right so we're gonna go light this up you guys see the way I did it I think that's enough it's pretty loose but it just kind of falls to each other so you can kind of see I do this just really kind of loose in the end it's just gonna all fall together so get a little air flow in there and we'll see if this rips some major clouds you all know the true test to test the brand using Egyptian label standard and you'll know your results from there then see like if you try a ferrous Bowl it might just be good just because of the bolt that's right I said it you don't like it jump off a cliff alright alright guys be back in a sec alright so here we are smoking trifecta not so blonde but I guess we'll refer to it as blonde and smoking the moral xizt more resistant we're thinking we're guessing and I didn't guess this someone here did maybe it's Moroccan zest so maybe so maybe it's something I'm not familiar with but it is zesty I will tell you that really zesty like the root of my mouth is actually like drying out it's a little sour but more than what is this this is like sour but like in a in a refreshing way right so that's what this is so good job I'm getting that a zest feel to it so it's pretty good smoking for like 10 or 15 minutes now pretty good and then just doing my research online that seems like a lot of you guys out there on reddit like this line by trifecta and so it's already known it's already a known brand we just got it today so I'm going to continue smoking this for the next however long does Bowl last hour and a half so long as I don't get distracted shout out some guy told me give a shout-out I pulled it up here still have it here shout out to Ramiro but people call him Junior alright he asked me for said really big fan alright so Ramiro jr. jr. Romero thanks bro thanks for everything shout outs anyone else I already shouted out to the true Good King I bet now with so many new people watching that not too many people know who that is so maybe I will make him known again who could John rep Alex shout out to him who know R up to the thunderclouds I'm not gonna do an impression of the true Burger King and I have to have a lot of I have to be on a lot of caffeine for that give me a couple Red Bulls and I'll do under clouds all right can't do it so that's it trifecta new line it's not a new line blonde now available at Buca John calm and thanks for watching and keep in touch alright thank you guys later", "jyhHQvSfHPI": "this is sambuca from Lucca procom and have another experimentation for you today with fruit and again instead of using a traditional Bowl that I normally would use I'm going to use an apple and I'm going to put some apple shisha tobacco inside of it so let's zoom in on it and I'll show you what I'm going to do and how I prepare it okay I have my apple here so I'm going to cut the bottom a little bit actually not I'm not even going to cut the bottom I'm going to try to cut the top even with the bottom that look about level no cut it again there we go nice piece of Apple mmm good stop what I'm going to do I'm going to take a spoon and I'm going to carve out the apple core make my bowl and see that but now the inside side take so long I want to get a good good cut guy got a good cut next step and take a potato peeler and stick it in the bottom here and I'm going to make a a hole on the bottom not too big because you want a nice tight fit see there the bottom the top see how it's kind of cut out I'm going to grab some chrome on apple flavor hopefully I have enough left in this package this out I'm going to use all of it see do I have enough room yes so what I'm going to do I'm going to put my finger in the bottom again of this to kind of keep stuff from falling down and hold it in my hand I'm going to take the tobacco and sprinkle it in the bottom try not to block that hole too much make sure you know what I got a I got a stem here so what I'm going to do actually is take the stem and lay it across the bottom and see that and then put the tobacco on top that way there it might keep the tobacco from falling through oh it's going to be good putting in on my shisha and tobacco we go looks pretty good all around pretty good amount I'm not going to pack it down just going to level it with the top maybe a hair under if I can just like that see now I got to put my aluminum foil and I've got to grab it so let me go and grab my aluminum foil and I'll be right back okay I'm back and I have my aluminum foil here the shiny side down on it on top of the apple just knife up I get a nice tight fit on top of the Apple just like that we'll hope the holes I'm going to use my tongs because I forgot let me grab a let me grab a toothpick okay use the toothpick just poke some holes like that pull everything back tight there we go and then we will put it back on top of the bowl on top of the ball on top of the hookah and I will set my coals up and we will try it out all right everybody I'm back and I've got the Apple set up now on top of my hookah as you can see here the Apple and I have two coals I have a mix on the coals because I felt I did the Kiwi earlier today I didn't feel like I was getting enough heat so I put two coals on once in Alhambra and once an exotic Oh so with two coals on there let's see how it goes pretty good tastes pretty good too the Roman Apple that I got from hookah shisha com it's a pretty good nice flavor and with the Apple Bowl I don't know I guess the apples giving it a little bit above a Napoli taste to the smoke and the base I still have the Kiwi strawberries so I have that in the base so it's a really nice fruit mix it's almost like a fruit punch mix it tastes pretty good and it's pretty easy to set up as you saw me do it it takes probably the same amount of time it would take you to set up a regular Bowl maybe a minute longer if that so I'd recommend trying it out why not what have you got to lose heck there's all kinds of stuff you could try there's many pineapples there's you could try a mango but that might be a little hard with the seed all kinds of different fruits you could try and see how it works out for you so yeah this is pretty good fun experimentation really enjoy doing this and showing you guys how to do an apple bowl I've had a lot of questions about it PMS on hookah Pro from people so here it is here's your Apple Bowl and here's how I set one up so try it out don't be afraid and see what happens put some apple in there put some mango in there put some double apple in there that might be pretty good I would have tried that but didn't have enough double apple left I smoked at all so any I'll try it out let me know what you think let me know if you have any other ideas for some videos PM me at hookah procom again my name is sambuca and Cheers", "EnwHZyuRIsM": "yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the run we're walking he bathtub accounting for me someone like bad start tell them -

"ycS713cCYfU": "this is Zach with strictly shisha and I'm back with another how to pack the Harmony Bowl someone requested that I pack a modern tobacco like Al Fakher Starbuzz or haze or filari or something so today I actually have a combination of Al Fakher grapefruit Starbuzz what was that Safari melon do and a little bit of sub-zero mixed in so what I have on here is the foil so flavors kind of broken up I'm just spread back and just sprinkled it like this I mix my flavors on foil so they don't absorb then the paper towel does absorb the flavoring and the juices what you want is to grab a little pinch and basically what you wanna do is just sprinkle this in the modern hsu sprinkle in very lightly packed unlike Tangiers or something or not follow you pack a little deeper or denser you want sprinkle it in and you can see the color differences that's the red is the off honker and the other two colors are that haze and the star buzz I'm just spraying a nice and evenly now with this blow both with the harmony and foil I kind of do it basically to the rim does really make a difference let's see okay clean it up a little bit spread it out make sure it's nice and even no real gaps or anything you want to burn money evenly so you want to kind of flush with the top not too much touching the only burn but not too much touching and definitely not over so if I look at it I mean there's there's not much over very flush what you do is if you have the Lotus on I just basically stick the Lotus on use your coals warm it up and you're ready to smoke some have questions about kind of holes I hope so with regular duty foil I use two layers the shiny side down obviously nice and tight if you're using heavy duty you only need one layer nice and tight my hands are still dirty someone still might not good we won't get into that so for the UM the monarchy shows I use a thumbtack poke at a moderate amount of holes not like Tangiers where I post so many with a toothpick if you're using something like a straight straight pin you might probably poke a little more holes for their smaller I do a straight line pattern I'm sorry a circle pattern left a circle pattern there is I'm getting attacked by a wild animal sleemoth got a new cat so if you see it running around okay about even all the way around not too many holes just enough for the airflow like I said this fire is recessed so I don't need to use a toothpick and just wipe off the top I'll use three coconut coals fully lit here here and here and I will rotate them as I smoke and stay tuned the next video is going to be packing a modern t-shirt and an egyptian bowl see you guys then crazy cat hi tails", "oJo1Ka04utA": "I mmm you", "Lvagb7LssbE": "hi everybody today I'm reviewing five different kinds of hemp wick first product that I tried was the italic I found that it was a fairly heavy smoke which I thought again I got a bit of a taste from it at times made in China I try to keep my money in North America being Canadian so not a big fan of the I tell so that's all I'm gonna say about it humble sent me a sample I sent an email to the website it cost me 225 and got a sample for a boat there to the black mark on the lighter so nice sample very fine wick kind of a connoisseur wick I would say very nice product didn't have a lot of information on their website that I could get off of there but yeah nice product I'll send me a few a sticker and the fridge magnet as well then I contacted organic flame a couple guys there named Steve and Jesse co-owners sent me a sample fairly small sample but that big neat thing about them is they put honey in their work I couldn't actually notice any of a taste difference but I mean if I had a sample I could give a bit better better review very friendly guys product made in Michigan check out the the website and yeah shoot them some support if you're michigan-based next product I have is dang stirring they sent me some stickers along with the samples of his both thick and and thin wicks sent a very generous sample of the thick with the thick wick I wrapped on to a an old-school old style napkin holder and that's the cool thing about the dank string is it's very moldable they use a fair bit of wax by the looks of it you could see it and it's very moldable good for arts and crafts and that sort of thing I enjoy the thick wick it burns fairly nicely and yeah good product then wick not quite as enjoyable as the thinner of those style the burning isn't quite as even but still a good quality like and then I've got a very generous sample from v-line they send out what they call their supporter package which was very kind of them included two full balls of their their wick this one you can see I've used most of it this is the wrapper that came around it so I've been using this pretty extensively for the last few months so you can see how much I've used and they send out a couple their individual packs as well many of which I shared with my my friends and they thank you for that healing also sent a wicked wand which is a very handy little tool for wrapping or liquor around also some stickers stickers and touches and Miranda over at beeline we exchanged a few emails and she was very very friendly very very informative said that their wick is made in a process called reading and no bleach no salts no bad things very environmentally friendly only the best type of attitude a lot of their product from is from either Eastern Europe or us yeah huge website check out their website that's that's basically what I'm gonna say on that a very very good product this is what I've been using for the last few months it burns really nicely burns really clean I don't get any taste from it the wax is well sourced the wick is well sourced there's details on it on their site the website is hemp wick beeline calm so check that out and thank you so much for the generous sample the b-line hemp wick is what I'll probably be using for the foreseeable future unless I get some some better products sent my way from other companies not that I'm starting a competition or anything but v-line very nice product well sourced like I said and I really enjoy so that's my two cents if you have anything you'd like to say put her in the comments any questions anything I missed anything I've misinterpreted if you're one of the manufacturers and yeah shoot me a message on there and we will see you next time", "Bwv68FUOcZE": "what if I done what have I done Oh what am I done oh we said the lego movie last night so good mr.
