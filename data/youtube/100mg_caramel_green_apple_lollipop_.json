{"6DEkaswGQWM": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeds the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking a look at a brand new product from a brand new company when we've never looked at before that is premium Cali dreams candy company they're a hundred and twenty milligram THC medical cannabis lozenge although I don't think it's a lozenge at all I think it is a caramel apple pop with 120 milligrams of THC big fan of the caramel apple pops it's a weird combination but the apple flavored lollipop with caramel on the outside it's great never had one with Whedon before especially one without 120 milligrams I picked this up for I believe 13 bucks at my dispensary although it was on a going out of we're no longer selling these soon to be illegal edible special for 50% off so I got it pretty cheap I'm excited to try it I always like different kinds of edibles and a caramel apple blowing pop sounds pretty good so for 13 bucks 120 milligrams is pretty good for that price especially for something that's not just a brownie or cookies something a little different like a lollipop like the packaging from the outside pretty basic stuff but uh but nice enough as is let's go ahead and shut up now and open it up and see what this bad boy tastes like and if this is the first time you're tuning into wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some number of this product well probably not gonna eat close to the whole thing because it's a big lollipop but I'm gonna eat some of it let you know do a taste test let you know how it tastes how it smells all that good stuff then I'll finish it off and for the most important part I'll come back in two hours to actually let you know how I am feeling guys because that is the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes alright so here is the pop here it's kind of smushed into this little container it's seems like it's gonna be hard to get out but let's give it a go okay came right out nothing to worry about so there it is there's the caramel apple what is this called again Cali dreams medical cannabis lozenge 120 milligrams handsome looking product give it a lick it's not bad no real cannabis taste can't detect any cannabis taste while just looking through it here I don't have the cojones to just bite straight into this but the taste at least so far pretty good if if it changes if there's something with a lollipop that's wrong or if the caramel eventually gets a weedy taste I'll be sure to let you know in the to our follow up but for now I quite like the taste of this one and like the funky style so guys I'm going to finish this off and then I will be back with you in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheat see you soon [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours here are the fruits of my labor the demolished remains of the Cali dreams 120 milligrams of THC caramel apple pop although that's what I'm calling it they call it a medical cannabis lozenge which it is not I liked it it's uh it's gotta be pretty high not not outrageously high not it's not super crazy effective it's not as good as a equivalently a good you know cookie or brownie it's not as good as like a hundred and fifty milligram Korova for example but I do like things that are a little bit different and I think this one's a little bit different it tasted good pretty much the whole way through the lollipop had a little bit of a Candace cannabis flavor but nothing too bad it was totally totally fine then at and you know was far from making me gag I said that's not the best descriptor but yeah it was pretty tasty the caramel was good I liked it it was a good way of getting THC and if you can find it 50% off like I did it's a hell of a deal at 13 bucks I still think it's not a bad price it is something that unlike a cookie or a brownie or rice krispies treat or whatever else you can't really split it being a lollipop so that might be you know something to strike against and you're gonna be taking this whole thing by yourself and you can't really save it for later either you can't really have half of it otherwise you just have a sticky mess so it's something you've got to commit to if that's you know what you're looking for for me it's a it's a middling endorsement for the Cali dreams hundred and twenty milligrams you see the dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little different a little outside the mold give it a try I think you'll be happy you did thanks so much for watching wheats guys that's going to do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace", "o_9i6xjzLRM": "hi everybody welcome to the i'm ready test kitchen i'm lauren and i will be showing you how to make caramel apple suckers today this is a really really fun recipe it's very nostalgic it reminds me of being a kid and getting a million of these suckers in my halloween bag so i figured why not give it a shot try and make some myself so for this recipe it's really simple you don't need that many ingredients it's just light corn syrup water granulated sugar our tart apple extract water soluble and then some caramel so our first step is adding all of our ingredients here except for the extract and caramel of course into a pot and then we'll turn the heat up until it all reaches 300 degrees which is the hard crack stage for candy i'm just going to turn up the heat and you don't you don't want to stir this the whole time i only stir it until the sugar is dissolved in the mixture and then just let it be don't touch it at all so let's turn this bad boy on i'll let it heat up just a little bit until it's hot enough for the sugar to really dissolve then i'll give it a good stir once it's dissolved we'll put in our candy thermometer here these are easy you can find them pretty much at most of your grocery stores you can get them online pretty inexpensive and it's really really important to have for this recipe so now that our sugar is all dissolved we are going to put in our thermometer and again we want this to reach 300 degrees and during the process of this you'll really be able to see the different stages of the sugar and how it gets really thick like a syrup and then it gets even thicker so it's more of the form of a hard candy so now we wait all right so we have reached the hard crack stage and this is where you will want to add in any flavorings if you want or food coloring so we'll be adding in the tart apple extract uh just one and a half teaspoons so you don't need much for really bold flavor and that's about five grams and we'll also be using a green food color because the original are green so these have to be green of course and you can smell this it's so potent it smells just like you'd imagine a tart apple to smell like we're just gonna add a little bit of food coloring and do a couple drops perfect you want to be careful too don't have your head right over right over your pot because you will get blasted with some extract steam and it's not fun i've done that before you'll you'll regret it all right so perfect so now this is ready to be poured into our mold so now it's time to pour our sugar mixture into our molds i've prepared these ahead of time all you have to do is grease them put the sticks in and then put them in your freezer until you're ready to pour in your mixture so it's okay if uh some of these overflow they don't have to be perfect they just have to be delicious all right so now these are ready to cool you want to let them cool for about one to two hours and then we will uh dip them in our caramel so we'll be back all right so our suckers have hardened and now it is time to dip it in our caramel so i just have store-bought caramel here you could heat it up on the stove in a double boiler or just pop it in the microwave like i just did and you'll want it to be a nice silky smooth consistency like we have here so let's dip i have here a sheet pan lined with a parchment paper so they won't stick once they dry make sure we get it nice and coated oh that looks so good i'm so excited to eat one of these look at that so adorable gourmet caramel apple suckers if you want them to harden a little bit faster you can pop them in the fridge after you're done dipping um if you're not in a rush you can leave them out at room temperature it should only take about you know an hour or two to uh harden up and be ready to eat all right and there you have it delicious caramel apple suckers these will be ready in hopefully about 30 minutes because i'm going to pop them in the refrigerator because i cannot wait to eat one i hope you guys enjoyed this recipe thanks so much for watching and we'll see you next time make sure to subscribe to our channel below so you don't miss when we

Apple Pops were introduced by the Tootsie Company in 1995 The Penny Candy Store always has the green apple on hand unless someone wipes us out that's happened in the past but they also make two other flavors of Caramel Apple Pops, the Red Macintosh and the Golden Delicious Every now and then we'll carry those So I have to be honest with you for some candies I already have ideas or plans I just have to kind of work out the kinks to get them filmed other times I really have no idea\nwhat I want to do for certain week for a candy mainly because there's all this\ncandy, but I want to be in the mood to eat that candy Even if it's a candy I'm not going to enjoy I'll have to be in the mindset to kind of be \"alright let's see how this candy is going to be\" and other times i'm like \"I really want to eat this candy, so I'm going to have  it this week\" so eventually I'll walk around the store, look at the candy and finally I will find one that will just tell me, it's time (Adele's \"Send My Love (To Your New Love)\" chorus plays) so the Caramel Apple Pops, basically a hard candy that's green apple flavored and then covered in caramel It's a nice sweet caramel flavor Luckily some of the green apple is sticking out of the caramel Because I've already been working on the caramel for a good minute and I haven't made much progress but the flavor of the green apple, it's a sour green apple I was expecting more of a sweet green apple, but it's sour, so that's really good thank you for watching this week's video of TheCandyGuy Links for the Penny Candy Store and myself will all be in the description of this video I post videos every Friday, so I shall see you all next Friday Have a sweet day. Bye!", "8nngt2XvvHM": "- If you're looking for an\neasy and delicious fall treat that's fun to make with kids, you've got to try my\nhomemade Caramel Apples. When apples are in season,\nthis is a must make recipe. Hey, you're watching \"Preppy\nKitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These Caramel Apples\nwill be ready in a snap. So let's get started. First off, let's talk about the apples. You have a lot of choices here, and really any eating apple will work. I like the traditional Granny Smith because it's really tart and that pairs nicely with the caramel. Another thing though, is that your apple's\nprobably covered in wax, we need to get that off\nbecause the wax is slippery, and when the hot caramel\ntouches it, what's gonna happen? Slides right off, not good. So take your apple and\ndip it in some really hot, scalding or almost boiling water, and then use a clean kitchen\ntowel and rub it vigorously. Polish it up like you're\ngiving it to a teacher. Just continue this process. I have a couple honeycrisps in here because that's Brian's favorite apple, so it'll be a nice treat for him. I love fall in New England, the beautiful colors, the\nbrisk chill in the air and of course, all the apples. We have a ton of apples here on the farm and even though I'm\nusing the Granny Smith, our varieties are so\ndelicious too, perfect. After the stems are removed, it's time to attach an apple stick, add it through the center, and then try and get it straight\nthrough, not too crooked. These are something else\nthat you can get there, pieces of plastic that look like sticks, that's what they look like. All right, the apples is\ngonna hang out in the fridge while we make the caramel. It's not a must-do, but I find that a cool apple kind of helps the caramel cling\non and set up more quickly. Now it's time to make the caramel, and if you've made caramel before, it's very similar but different. So here's the deal. (laughs loudly) Let me start off by adding almost all the ingredients into our pot. Two cups or 400 grams of brown sugar, and I'm using a combination\nof light and dark, one, because it doesn't really matter and two, it's like the\ntwo open bags I had so. I need half a teaspoon of salt, five tablespoons or about\n70 grams of unsalted butter, if you want to use salted butter, just reduce the salt by\na quarter of a teaspoon that you're adding in, one and a half cups or\nabout 350 ml of heavy cream, and finally, the secret ingredient for your caramel is Corn Syrup, this will help it become much more sticky and cling on to your apples. I don't use Corn Syrup all the time, but when I do, it's\nbecause it's necessary, it really is needed for some recipes. Before I put this on heat, here's what you should have on hand, because you do not wanna\ngo searching around once this has started. Okay, a wooden spoon. This is to stir things in the beginning, and the wooden spoon is not going to change the temperature\nof the caramel very much, and because it doesn't conduct heat, it's not gonna burn\nyour hand, double bonus. A little bit of water to\ndip your pastry brush into, the pastry brush will\nbrush the sides down, it's really important\nnot to scorch the glide. And the last thing is a\ncandy thermometer, right? Let's set this over a\nmedium, low heat right now, and we're gonna stir until things are melted in homologous. So once it's all melty and fine, then we can stop stirring. All right? So I'm just gonna\nstir this over that medium, low heat, I'm really waiting\nfor that butter to melt. So, you can speed this up through editing. (soft chiming) Everything is basically melted, I'm gonna stop stirring\nand switch my pastry brush. Just wash the sides down, you don't want all that stuff burning. If you watch my channel,\nyou've heard this before, but having a nice thick\nwalled pot is so important. A lot of times, if you're\nusing a really thin walled pot, scorches everything either\ninvest in a nice pot, or you can find them secondhand, super cheap and see that\nthe walls are thick, it makes a huge difference,\nthat's all washed down. Now we can switch to our thermometer and just check things out. I want this to be in the Soft Ball Stage, that's 235 to 245 Fahrenheit, I'll put the Celsius in the card blocks, I don't remember it offhand. This is why you don't wanna\nuse a small pot for this, In fact, the caramel will be bubbly, so if it was a tiny pot,\nhuge mess, no, no, no. We're gonna take this off heat, it just reached 235 after\na caramel has been off heat for a minute or two, go ahead and mix in one tablespoon or 15 ml of a nice vanilla, they'll add some good\nflavor to your caramel. Okay, mix that In, and you can see the consistency of the caramel is pretty like, it's pretty thickened. We're gonna set the caramel\naside for five to 10 minutes, it kind of depends on\nthe ambient temperature of your kitchen, but\nthe dipping temperature is gonna be around 190 Fahrenheit. So yeah, this is like\nstill exactly 235 degrees (pot clicking) and take a minute. Make sure that caramel's\ntotally off heats. I was like, why is this still\nlike 0.3 degrees cooler. It should be cooler by now, It's 'cause it was on ultra low, I turned the knob the wrong way. While the caramel chills, set up a little station for dipping them because you wanna work kind of quickly and chances are, you want to\ndecorate these apples as well, you could totally do them\njust plain, a caramel though they will be delicious and pretty. I'm gonna to do some mini M&Ms, some sprinkles and some chopped peanuts. So, chop the peanuts on\nyour tiny cutting board, dump that into a bowl. The Last thing you need is\na place to put the apples, they're gonna be super sticky\nand it would be heartbroken if your apple was stuck to a\npiece of paper or the counter. So you want them to cool on the\nleast sticky thing possible. It's gonna be a silicone sheet if you have any Silicone\nBaking Sheets, get one out and if you don't, use a piece of parchment paper, it'll also work. My caramel just hit one 190 so, let's pour into a little bowl, this stuff is delicious by the way, and yes, you can make caramels out of this like little packaged caramels, do it, same recipe, dip your apple in, give it a little bit of a turn and you can even scrape the bottom off if you want it to have\nless caramel on the bottom, now it's ready to either place onto our Silicone Baking Sheet or you can decorate it. So this one, for example, could get some little\nmini M&Ms cutting it. Is that too many or just\nenough? I don't know. (dryer whooshing) Okay, so here's the real, if you see a bunch of\nair bubbles hanging out in your caramel, that's not gonna be\ngiving you a pretty apple, So use a hairdryer or a heat gun if you have one and just pop them. (dryer whooshing) It's back to dipping apples, here we go, and then\ncontinue decorating it, this one's gonna get some sprinkles on it, it doesn't seem to get a\nlittle bit of everything on it. So, some peanuts, some M&Ms\nand then some sprinkles, it's the Monster Apple. This monster is ready to cool down and I might be jumping into it later but I wanted to talk to you about what to do with the excess caramel, this is not waste, We're gonna make some little\ncaramel candies for it. So clear this away and let's move along. Just plop them either\nonto a piece of silicone like I am or onto a very\nlike maybe lightly oiled piece of parchment paper, form it into either like a log, a brick, whatever shape you want. and as you can see, it really will not stick to the silicone and this is perfect. From a caramel into a breaker log and then set it aside to cool completely. Once it's cooled, you can\ncut it into smaller pieces and either enjoy it right away or wrap it into a partial paper for later. Now let's cut that caramel apple up, I want a bite. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my fall playlist, all my favorite fall recipes\nin one playlist for you. But now it's time for a bite. That was so delicious, I love the apple, the caramel and the toppings all working together and every bite.

never tried before but if I have I don't think I actually enjoyed these if I have I hold my palette it's changed so I hope these are good 1 2 3 or 5 6 in here alright caramel on the outside of it Apple part I wish that caramel was on the inside is and I wish out there was less of it cuz I'm barely reached the Apple part they're good together here but PJ if I just like the caramel part it's not good so I wish you that there is less caramel on this so you can enjoy this more I do like it just I wish there's less grandma on the outside of it hmm so good though I like caramel I hate those people that say caramel cuz I have caramel I like it so good good I owe you try it I like it I remember it tasting like this I've ever had it I remember the taste of this I don't really look familiar anyways so yeah is where I got it currently 6 in this little bag for a dollar at don't like that kind of target it's very good he like caramel and apple stuff let me know you guys like this you guys haven't tried it why haven't you tried it because I'm enjoying it otherwise sort of ugly video I hope you guys enjoyed it stay tuned for tomorrow's vlog video at this point I don't know what it is yet so let's see who's tomorrow bye", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to

time yeah their ships world or something I don't know yeah I'm telling you're good at that Colin stuck in your teeth the back yeah I managed to get my caramel rolled up in a little ball so yeah it's very good I want to know spooning rapper is our equation magically it's not there anymore magically there's just a teeny tiny smell that is a very good normal it's good or do you get them I don't get the yeah Apple at all but I love and you even bit into it so you've got a big hunk of the middle yeah I didn't get in there plenty on you wanna try a red one I don't know I don't know if it's gonna be worth it we'll try one more the green one probably that okay the green we program is a stronger sophistication its best we should do it off camera hmm that's a green ring green sucker again it's coated in the caramel don't break your tape don't I can buy that it's the size of my room neither comas the same I'm wondering about the Sun I know with you one you know the suppertime different I'm just thinking if you get these in the bag for Halloween kids gonna be happy with any of these cuz they're all gonna have that thick thick caramel on the outside it's gonna take them a while to get to the sucker that sucker tastes good I mean the green part tastes good it's not super strong but it is good and how many calories are these each 16 16 I don't think that's worth it I just took you along it was like a while mm-hmm now the best suckers Kevin probably does not remember the best Halloween suckers we've ever had and I've only seen them last year at CVS they might have them everywhere now but they were at CVS last year and you couldn't mom anywhere else in town they were charms brand and they were candy corn flavor we actually mean oh yeah we kept them and you would get you one and that would be like your sweet thing that you would have whoa watch TV because they tasted I mean like dead-on candy corn and they lasted so long that flat one like these yes yeah I never even color yes they were color like a piece of candy corn orange wide in yellow and they were just wonderful in their charms brand so if you see those you have to pick those up because I'm telling you they are awesome awesome awesome yeah so well these were good the Starbucks for good these are good these are gonna last you a while sorry I had it spits them out off-camera but if you get you get a green apple flavor out of the sucker once you get down to probably not the best idea level review sounds on camera they do have a try thing charms even has a graph and you know what we might have reviewed those last year on camera I don't know you know you would have to do a search for charms undermine my channel but anyway these were both good I think kids would be thrilled to have any and things like I said because that candy a better caramel is so strong and then the star works for good too and I'm sure you'll be able to buy them in smaller packages so hopefully you enjoyed this review and thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "vUtA3HafLNg": "hi today we're going to make some sour apple lollipops using two different types of citric acid one liquid form and one powder form I also am going to use two different types of molds I got these molds for Christmas this mold here is meant probably for chocolate but it worked for lollipops but the best way to make lollipops obviously is by using a lollipop mold that has a place for a stick so let's get started alright start with two cups of sugar 3/4 cup corn syrup 3/4 cup of water turn your heat on to a medium heat and stir this up until the sugar dissolves try to keep the sugar from collecting around the side wipe the sides down with the wet paper towel to keep it on sugar now let that boil until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit let a boil in the pot for about 20 minutes add about 10 drops of food coloring of your choice stir that in we want the water to evaporate now add the flavoring I'm using apple flavor one dram of apple flavor by Lorraine's oils and add a bout a tablespoon of this at a tablespoon of tart and sour I'm just gonna guess and you can purchase these at a cooking shop or probably on Amazon I don't know if that's going to make it sour enough so I did add some citric acid I've seen them do it on lofty pursuits so I'm gonna try it out but see it's not going to boil out so it won't burn I put lollipop sticks in these molds and these do not require in volley pop sticks so we're gonna see how that works pour them into your mold and take the stick and just twist it a little bit there you go all right the pot would be a mess so all you need to do is fill it with water and the water will break it down and clean it up all right it is possible to use these molds the only problem is you have to keep standing them up until the syrup is hard and there you have it some sour apple lollipops thank you thanks for watching", "WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "vuMiIQU4Wwk": "cheapy we have to make that sour candy apple thing one more game I should have just listened to her but it was too late [Music] it's over this recipe you're gonna need sour warheads lots of sour warheads I guess they're supposed to come in five assorted flavors we opened up five bags and I only see three now look there's one yellow it's like a it's like a minority so it's not much of a variety pack is it I'm actually surprised to see how many problems we had this is an entirely empty one this was open there's no candy in this one yeah it's disgusting ZPL take a little air pocket so based on our lack of options we won't with blue raspberry go with any flavor you want if you can find it and since we had to open each one individually we figured we turn into a games ready set go [Music] [Applause] now just melt the candy JP found these really great sticks that are perfect their bamboo you do one I do one okay so I took the stem out and all we're gonna do is take the stick and put a little pressure kind of turn it and twist it and stick it in there dude how asian do I look right now I'll try a watermelon to you over a black cherry okay black cherry kind of scares me I'm not gonna lie we're doing a taste test guys because we trust this company I don't trust it at all anymore after the bags I bought I bought five bags and only one lemon in no green apple we got the green apple there we do ready let's try this [Music] little monkeys like pull em and Julia what's that chemical called malic acid malic acid there's citric acid and an malic acid and those are derived from fruit so it's like very tart like our entire element yep that that timer just went off guys you know what that means tiny dips and apples no means time for unboxing all right JP our warheads are melted in the oven we're ready to dip our apple and after we dip our Apple what are we gonna put on top of it I think we should put fun dip on top we're doing it that's some sour sugar that's all it is we're using blue raspberry warheads we're using blue raspberry fun dip this is so much fun awesome so let's put it in okay we're gonna take it right out oh dear this is official JP I don't want to put too much what's too much enough there's no such thing as too much we just finally finished making an extreme sour warhead blue raspberry candy apple this is the longest name ever but it's the best thing that I think we've ever done eat it oh it's so sour your tongues immediately turning the color oh malic acid I know you guys are wondering why aren't there two candy apples well I'll show you this one there's only one that came out good because JP wanted to add other stuff to the warhead goo and it was a bad idea I taste blue razzmatazz so having my my tongue is blue now this is the greatest thing you've ever done what's your guys's favorite candy make sure to comment below and maybe we can put that on top of a candy apple make sure to subscribe here and check out some related videos here and here you've made candies we've also done a bunch of other Halloween themed videos so check them out Julie you got a shimmy I'm not going bye guys again happy Halloween and stay safe out there keep that one let your let your parents check your candy and if it looks like this don't eat it", "wnLmkqnFMrI": "[Music] you some of the ingredients in this recipe are a little odd they're probably things that you don't already have in your kitchen so you will need to plan a little bit ahead of time before you make this but they're easy to find when you look for them and they're definitely worth the effort sugar citric acid which you can find in caning supply cream of tartar if you don't have that you can also use just a little bit of lemon juice green coloring you can either use gel or powder coloring either an apple flavoring this you'll find in specialty stores a lot of times craft stores will have these they end up filling up the mold and looking really nice all you have to do once they harden is pull them out and I like to set them on the silicon mat", "WbB_dZb1IWs": "[Music] okay you got your apple what do you do with it now well here's an idea you can make them into a caramel apple these things are gobbled up all year long but for some reason they're even more popular around halloween so let's go behind the scenes to watch as apple experts turn this into this we all know an apple a day keeps the doctor away but hey no one said it couldn't be a caramel apple right these fruity treats are the perfect combination of healthy snack and decadent dessert all ready to eat on a neat little stick there's some arguments over the history of caramel apples but some would argue that chicago is the caramel apple capital of the world well then let's head to the windy city to take a look at how these snacks get from tree to treat affy tapple of chicago makes millions of taffy apples each year it all starts with the apples themselves the best apples to use for caramel apples are a nice sweet tart and firm apple the ones we use the most of are granny smith and jonathan apples the apples are unpacked inspected and any bad apples are picked out the reject apples actually go to a local juicer who creates apple juice out of them then things get a little sticky the apples are picked off the conveyor belt carefully centered and then a stick is inserted through the core this part is a little tricky so it's done by highly trained apple sticking experts an apple is a product of nature and it's not a perfect sphere so in order to really make the best caramel apple you need to put the stick directly through the core next the perfectly speared spheres are slotted onto this special machine that takes them for a ferrous wheel-like ride to the dipping area the apples dive into a pool of hot gooey caramel but it's not the common kind you'd buy at the store some people think that we have people sitting in the back unwrapping wrappers and throwing little pieces of caramel melting them that's absolutely not true instead aphey tapple makes up big batches of its own special caramel coating we have a secret recipe that we've used for 50 years we we have not tweaked it but sorry we can't reveal exactly what that recipe is it's a secret there is some secret stuff but the basic ingredients are corn syrup milk and sugar mix together and heat it up the apples dive into the caramel dip and then are twirled around to shake off the excess after the apples do their dip they are wheeled around a tray of peanuts so that every side is consistently coated workers give the apples a final look over at this point hand dipping any that are maybe a little nude into the nuts so they're completely covered then it's off to the packaging area where each apple goes into its own little plastic pack the demand for the apples peaks in summer and fall as caramel apples are sold as both carnival treats and halloween goodies on a busy day affytaple can turn out a quarter of a million apples over the course of a year we'll run in excess of 11 12 million apples and there's even times where we tap out a lot of the orchards in different parts of the country and america's craving for these caramel treats is growing caramel apples as a business have grown every year over the last 10 years while some of the other candies have actually dropped and decreased part of their popularity is that they are seen as both yummy and healthy kids love it and parents love it for kids because it's a fresh apple it's a good healthy snack not just a fun carnival item caramel apples can also be made at home if you don't want the factory having all the fun and what about caramel apple's close cousin the candy apple well that's a whole different thing made with hard sugar on the outside to give a crunchy not chewy coating candy apples are traditionally on the east coast and on the west coast because caramel apples got their start here in the midwest you really don't see candy apples too often anywhere in this area so don't expect anyone at affy tapple to help you make those you", "csap2x7eHrY": "with him from the squishy monster.com and today I'm sharing with you some adorable mini caramel apple pops so these are actually scooped out into the flesh of an actual Apple so you don't have to be so committal because they make a ton and you can personalize them and roll them across candies cookies or sprinkles whatever your heart desires and if caramel isn't too thin you can also dip it in chocolate it's important to consider preventing the caramel from sliding off when you prepare these so organic unwaxed sweet works best and you want to go in there with a metal melon baller or a coffee scoop and you just want to go make a round firm and full scoop like this and it really helps if you leave some of the skin on so I'm going to continue scooping my flesh out the absolute most important thing is to make sure that all of your balls are is bone-dry as possible so you'll have to blot multiple times throughout this process you'll have to do it now and later before you dip because any trace of moisture will allow the caramel to slide right off it's best to work in batches so I'm going to stick a popsicle stick into each one and I'm going to place them in the freezer while I work on the caramel and as you're sticking them in there's more liquid that seeps out you want to go in there and dry that off as well like they said keeping these dried is the most important step oops to my caramels I just want to drizzle in just a little bit of cream or milk and a little pinch of salt because I love that how about salt really offsets all the queenly sweet parts of this because I love that tart and refreshing bite from the Apple and then that rich creamy butteriness from the caramels but I don't want it to be too too overwhelming so I'm going to and listen to my microwave in 30 second bursts until it's smooth and melted just like my apples I like to work with my pool of caramel sauce in batches as well everything in batches so make sure you blot your Apple ball again and slowly dip them into this pool of chocolate and I have a slip of wax waiting for me because as soon as you dip this guy you want to pop it back into the freezer when it's tap off any excess and then another trick to keep being keeping these to set and not to slip off is to bowl in cookie crumbs or candy sprinkles whatever you like and then I'm going to put this guy into the freezer really quickly keep in mind that as your caramel cools and makes it easier for it to stick and just kind of comes together much nicely and now I'm going to roll this one into some cookie crumbs I've got some gingersnap crumbs that I'm rolling it into this golf graham cracker whatever your heart desires even some candies would be really fun for this - so remember pop this guy really really quickly into the freezer", "qhfZyTBPoQ0": "today a little bit of baking they really making some caramel lollipops what makes these camera livebox specialty masks were using today we butter / can of water whatever you want to call it get high better that make you feel good juju today we're using my form of it I like youth coconut oil cause it draws out the most THC out of the lead for some reason I don't necessarily know the science part of that don't but I do it with very good understanding of how that [ __ ] works and it can be substituted for a regular letter so the recipe were using today actually calls for regular butter but I'm just substituting same thing at cold temperature or room temperature cocoa butter I'm sorry coconut oil will freeze and make it usable as butter if you melt it it's gonna become a will so you can use it it's very malleable now we're gonna let me show you guys what we're working with here we've got two tablespoons yes two tablespoons of water one and a half tablespoons of vinegar and we've got one teaspoon of salt sea salt to be specific a high-quality it looks like nothing's in there but daily hey there's something in there I promise yeah then we have the cocoa might throw up my baby boo but baby doodoo and it's gonna taste bad hum and then we've got one cup of brown sugar right here and last but not least we have 1/4 cup of sheriff liked it or not the darkness once it's all finished we're gonna mix in some vanilla extract the only reason I don't have that way that was because I like to do this by eye so to speak they call for a teaspoon just kind of portion today the recipe calls for us they pretty much just mix all of this in the pot so yeah man have you come over here I'll show you how to do this by the way we're drinking a Bohemia it's a pilsner don't really know the [ __ ] oh yeah it tastes good sure the first yeah so you put the heat on after you add everything yes okay he goes on a hot pot of burning sugar before you think you started it makes sense isn't the bottom of the sugar 1/3 water in vinegar hmm no been the corn syrup this person a little tricky because the brew is in the bowl this is why you should always have a rubber spatula I've mentioned that before make sure you keep your rubber spatula with you okay was it medium I don't know how you're still worse don't use an electric stove and I don't I don't know sponsored by Stokes if you use an electric stove at home you need to throw that [ __ ] trash yeah stir it a little bit right make sure I'm not sure the bottles combined yeah and then we can add that I stood this butter here all right so we're just gonna pretty much get this to a boil I'll show you guys what it looks like on the back to the world but the whole ultimate goal here or the end goal is to get this to be 300 degrees that's gonna be a hard crack it's much easier when you have what's called the candy thermometer Andy it's very easy to measure and even tells you what it's called that's gonna be called a hard crack meaning like this it's gonna be not chewy little more than a lollipop texture so yeah we're just gonna blow this out and let everything out together so at first this is not gonna look like it's coming together it's gonna look very separate like your sugar that the bottom of it and that the link was just kinda at the top not makes me bitter but as you can see keep boiling this is not something that you want to keep stirring by the way just stop as you keep boiling you'll see that it starts to blend together okay we're just about at 300 now which should be a hard crack temperature and starting to solidify just a little bit have any worried that the wood is starting to come together so to speak so go for like two more minutes we're gonna give it a chance to cool it down and we'll come back and show you when it cooled and then let's start to transfer it to the mold but it means this little container here it's just a lot of measuring jar to make it a little bit more you won't and then I just also add a little bit of vanilla extract just gonna starting to cool down I'll give you some flavoring actually I want to add something else for flavorings so that I really know the proof why should it rate and nephews away right there you are alright now we're gonna start pulling into the molds ooh that's hot this book mmm cannot fast swirl the lollipop stick in there to get it's all to sit yeah I don't work a little clipping at this - I chose always so size [Laughter] that's okay they're still warm and I solidify them when I close the lid go for it on that right now we need to work quickly because the rest of the mold arch the caramel is still very hot and I want guys to come out so I'm just gonna work work on the stick place man it won't be some sideways ass looking sticks sorry another thought mm-hmm were you making this video about was perfect hmm cuz you're on time oh yeah you tell I don't work out I do push ups and push ups push ups when you lift your fingers are the only thing gonna work out okay now to form Oh as you can see it got a little a little friendly with you yeah yo right here Cheers seal them up pop them in the freezer an apartment afraid of me back in like counting so you saw who I thought put bets at the cool yours one attack in like ten minutes hmm you see what they look like boom should care more heart Dali Pablo look at the back look at the front try this yeah there is wait

kid I always seen them candy ass never got one I never really liked it matter of fact I don't even think I would've tried it as a kid I just wasn't into it I was like damn an apple covered weekend he

Cheers okay like I told you last time my stranger knew everybody's palate you know your tongue everybody's tongue is always gonna taste something different than person so just because I tell you I don't taste Atlas doesn't mean that you will not take that much me personally I taste caramel I taste I don't want to say it cherry well I taste some type of candy which you either outer shell and the layer of the Apple obviously I don't taste peanuts that would be kind of weird but yeah all I taste is caramel and candy the caramel is in stronger than the candy the candy the candy is a powerfully them but you taste the candy a lot too and that the caramel is is there it's very consistent I just really wish our technology was also here stick this in the camera and then you must put your lips on

yeah", "mmFXOFtiZf4": "I love caramel apples they're delicious but honestly they're awkward to eat I mean it's an apple on a stick today I'm going to show you a delicious easy way to make caramel apples that's gonna be super fun for parties and you can make them at home there's so many fun things happening in the fall like tailgating and Halloween parties so I thought it'd be fun to take one of my favorite recipes from this time of year and turn it into an appetizer of sorts I'm calling these caramel apple pops the recipe can be found in the description below the first thing we want to do is get our apples ready so what we did with these is we boiled them in hot water for about 5 seconds apples from the store and normally come with wax on the outside and that wax actually repels caramel and I want to make this as easy as possible on you at home so we went ahead and boiled that wax off and then took a dry cloth and just rubbed them really good after we took them out of the hot water that way they're ready to go and they're ready to be dipped and one of my favorite ways to cut apples actually is to cut around the core it makes it easier so almost like you're leaving a little square in the center you could use an apple corer but I just prefer this method to me it's a little easier so I'm going to cut these into hearty slices and then I'm gonna put lemon juice on top the reason why I'm doing lemon juice is so I can prevent these from turning brown because the last thing I want to do is present these at a party in they're brown and they look Genki now here's a trick we want to have a lemon juice on these it's gonna give it a nice little tangy flavor but when we go to dip them in the caramel I'm gonna make sure all the moisture is off of the slices so the caramel will stick if we were just to make the caramel and dip a wet apple into it it's not really gonna stick you want them to be as dry as possible when we go to dipping them in the caramel so we have those sitting we're gonna let those soak a little bit in the lemon juice to make sure they get really good and protected from browning and we're gonna start our caramel so what we have is 8 ounces of soft caramels and put those in our pocket and I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of heavy whipping cream and we're gonna get our heat going you're gonna want it to be on about medium-low because if you crank it up too high and you start boiling the caramel it's gonna burn and it's gonna be a hot mess disaster and while our caramel is melting we are going to use treat sticks you can find them at your local craft store you can buy them I'm sure online Hot Tips make this even easier to stick our treat sticks into our apples is you're going to trim a little bit off the bottom of your apple just to make sure it's flat it will be easily inserted great so super cute there's our first one so again while our caramel is melting we're gonna build all of our pops so when I was a kid I loved Halloween in one way because I loved getting dressed up as a princess so any excuse to put on like a tiara and a frilly dress and frolic around like I was the cat's pajamas my favorite Halloween costume was when I dressed up like Cinderella that was me however the boys in my neighborhood would jump out from the bushes and scare you as you're trick-or-treating so I got to the point where I could barely go out I would cry before trying to leave a house because I was so scared of these neighborhood boys but I did love candy so I would eventually overcome my fears and go trick-or-treating okay this caramel is melting it's looking good so you want to make sure your caramel is bubbling a little bit but you don't want it to get really really hot because then it will burn and your you will know that it's burning because you'll get these little like dark brown pieces in the bottom I don't know I'm sure but yeah you don't want dark brown pieces you want it to look really smooth and creamy so I'm gonna take this off because I don't want to burn I'm going to let it cool down for a little bit because when you're building your caramel apple pops you don't want the caramel to be really hot because it won't stick to your caramel apples so we want to let this cool for a few minutes just so it's really thick and then we'll bring it back out and we will dip our apples so we have our apple pops all set up ready to go again I made sure and took as much of the moisture out of these as I could with a paper towel I just really dried them off really good to make sure the caramel can stick to the Apple pops and also when we dip these we're really trying to get the caramel to stick to the skin you know when you see a big caramel apple the caramel is all around on the skin because that's a good conduit for it but the flesh part is a little more challenging so we're really going to focus on getting the caramel on the skin and this caramel is cold for a couple minutes so we are ready to dip these apples so when I did youdid we all do I was told not to sing that for copyright reasons all right let's start dipping these hop number one done I'm gonna put it down and I put our topping on it I'll do this one with sprinkles and it's much easier to sprinkle your toppings on top and said have you taken the pop and just dipping it in there so pop number two just dipping it in there getting it really good on the skin gorgeous we're just gonna keep on dipping I still want to see a little bit of the green skin so when I'm dipping these I'm not gonna dip the entire Apple you're just getting that just get the hip pretzel this one up I love the pretzel topping it's kind of like salted caramel it's delish and again we're just doing one Apple here you can use mini apples as you want this makes a good amount of caramel so I mean dip to your heart's content okay so we have some with sprinkles some with bretzel some with Reese's Pieces some with nuts but you could do whatever toppings you want chocolate chips you can even add a chocolate drizzle if you like but these are ready to go I'm gonna let them sit in the fridge for about 10 to 15 minutes just to get them set really nice and well and then we're gonna bring them out to serve so I have some of our caramel apple pops already made and dips but I wanted to set up an apple dippin station for when I have my friends over to enjoy these caramel apples and I love food that's interactive I mean who doesn't love interactive party food and I wanted to set it up too so that my guests can make their Apple pops and dip them in the caramel and I also had in mind like how can I make this look fall and rustic and feel like a Halloween party or a fall party so I have this burlap table runner this wooden cutting board it just feels a lot like fall and also when I'm thinking about my Apple station I was thinking about like what do people enjoy on caramel apples I personally love chocolate so I have some Reese's Pieces peanut butters are great combo store chocolate and peanut butter is perfect some people like salty so we have some nuts and some chopped up pretzels or you could do like fun sprinkles or maybe even a little like orange and purple sanding sugar something fun like that I am super excited about fall I feel like this whole set up is a perfect way to walk them and fall before I get to dip in I want to capture this set up [Music] so cute hmm these are delicious but I want to see how you style your caramel apple Bob's tag at Pop kitchen on Instagram or comment below I want to know what you want to see me

that og deliveries", "nq344D7IgOo": "[Music] welcome to y'all the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are taking a look at another edible we are taking our first look at chill just keep it nice and chill chill medical cannabis cherry chunk dark chocolate hundred and eighty milligram THC each batch is triple lab tested who doesn't love seeing that I love seeing lab tested results on my edibles let's read there are little flavor texts on the package here at chill we offer the highest experience from our cocoa to our cannabis we are dedicated to quality safety and social responsibility we work daily to give our consumers a consistent safe and delicious product our chocolate bars are handmade with ethically sourced ingredients of the highest quality this is truly the highest chocolate that's the second time they made that joke and then on the back we've got nutrition advice we've got ingredients love seeing those as well so a couple of points there for having lab tested results which you can see right there on the back having ingredients and nutrition information I always love to see that for my edibles so as I said this is chill a kind of nice packaging here 180 milligrams of THC and this is the chocolate-covered cherries flavored Wow okay so it is packaged and exactly like Bane bars if you've ever seen the bang bars it's both the same exact milligram \u00e4j-- and pretty much identical packaging so chill and bang very similar uh and this says keep out of the reach of children on it in case you're wondering what it says and do do keepo the reach of children and it looks to be exactly the same way designed as bang bars to a couple of rectangular shaped his nurse if I could get this whole thing open excuse me everyone I'm incompetent okay it's not exactly the same way as Bing I believe bang is for vertical rectangles this is ten half split in half rectangles well let's give this chill a taste I was gonna try to come up with something clever to say but I couldn't so that's why I just went let's get this chill uh taste let's give this Joe a taste [ __ ] you perforations okay in terms of chocolate I put it about the bang level of taste it's pretty good it's not the best this this ain't of all say this ain't Kiva in terms of taste it's right about the bang level so good good not meant in any way derogatory eyes and complain good solid chocolate no complaints about the taste don't really taste any of the cover are the big chunks of cherry as they promised but I'll say them not bad at all um so taste test is fine but now for the most important test is this chill gonna get me chillax in and for that guys you guys are gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how this chill is lying in thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace chill the highest chocolate cherry chunk dark chocolate and guys this is pretty much bang every nice thing I have to say about bang and every the few not glowing things I had to say about bang apply to this as well this is good chocolate not great chocolate this is potent stuff but not the most potent stuff but it's available for a pretty decent price I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bucks for a 180 milligrams that might sound like a lot but here where I am in Long Beach that's actually and at this dispensary is a pretty good deal I picked up a more expensive less potent two chocolate one that I'm actually more excited for because it's a default city but overall I really liked the chill this is something I have no problem recommending to folks again tasting pretty good got me quite high got me up to the eighth level easily and in on all it was pretty reasonable price to so as far as chill goes I am quite pleased with my first experiment with them that is the chill the highest chocolate a pun I don't think is that good cherry chunk dark chocolate if you see in the dispensary near you and they got it for a reasonable price give it a shot especially if they don't have Kiva or DuPont say or any of those you know premium premium brands I think Jill's gonna do the job for you guys and that is gonna do it for this review here on weights I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "XzjOkDLD3fw": "so to start off I cut off the ends of the Apple so I'd have a flat surface but you want to pay your Apple into thick slices about 3/4 inch thick take a napkin or paper towel and happy Apple to remove extra juice this will help the chocolate to stick better to the Apple next remove the stem and the seeds from your apples make a little cut at the bottom of the apples with your knife and this will just help the sticks to go in a lot easier then take your melted chocolate and break them into small chunks and place them into your pan you could also use the heat per Pole for this if you don't have a pan I used one saucepan half-full of water and let it get hot and then I place my other saucepan with chocolate on top and slowly mix the chocolate until it's completely melted and silky then I took my apple and covered it with chocolate I found the easiest way to do it let's pour the chocolate on with the spoon so then I could manage it and remove the extra and I made sure to put some chocolate on the stick to act as a glue for the stick in the Apple and then I set the apples into the fridge and let them set for five to ten minutes next I used white chocolate melting wafers and I melted them the same way as I did with the dark chocolate and I repeated the same process one more time with the Kraft chronal bits and now is the time whenever you get to decorate any way you like I started drizzling some caramel and white chocolate onto the apples some of the apples I mix both the crema on the white chocolate some I just made for white chocolate and some I just made for caramel and then a few of them I place some crushed up peanuts onto the caramel apples as well the caramel starts to harden quickly so you have to work fast with it but I did end up having to go back and your heat it and once the toppings are all dry you can add them to a platter and enjoy them with your family and friends I hope you guys enjoyed watching this I'll see you guys in my next video bye guys", "ATYn-KBNgc8": "what's up everybody welcome back to another episode of strange city today guys gonna be reviewing mile-high suckers um we're gonna got the we got the mixed berry flavor working with 10 milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams of THC so that is what we have got going guys just getting into it here and open it up for you it does have a yes do have to bite it or open it with scissors because it is childproof guys so do mind that that it is not gonna have a seal I would open it the other way I just walked up so you got your lollipop here it's got an imprint of THC with an M underneath to say medical or to dictate medical tastes really good but we're gonna get out of here guys see you shortly 30 minutes an hour so I'm like that not sure gonna let this kick in and we'll come back and I just loved you guys off meant to do it a piece but with bad guys to review this after we're high from it peace guys what's up everybody welcome back to the second part of this lollipop mile ha sucker review guys mixed berry flavor from mile high 30 milligrams of THC 10 of CBD picked up at affinity guys today the repeat that we're doing on this is gonna be the more of how to fix and things like that the first part was more of the taste I'm still eating on it obviously I didn't finish it should knock me out went to sleep but very very good guys um the taste overall when you first start into a lollipop I pop second taste is gonna be that dry Hoshi powdery type taste I don't know that house to describe it you kind of have to eat inedible to illegal edible to to kind of get that flavor or that that taste for it so thank you paying a my Lighting's perfect leave it right there so we're pancake being my lighting studio basically really really good guys I would give this a good a good eight or nine out of ten I would say it eight out of ten the flavor is pretty strong on it of candidates I have have had some edibles that geez what are you doing that don't taste as strong of cannabis or that powdery taste I'm not sure if that's really doable with a lollipop but from edibles that have had those chocolate bars and drinks and stuff like that they have tended to be a little less weedy if you will and a little more of the lollipop or the other taste so that's not really hindering the full experience of you know an enjoyable edible so that being said guys basically this stuff is like edibles are a full-body hi to me I don't ever get edibles in my head on they never messed with me in the head it's always a body high and it's always something I don't really ever feel until about 75 milligrams but this was pretty good man I I didn't mean finished all of it i I did feel some effects from it which would just be kind of lighter body and [ __ ] your body weight seems lighter I'm just kind of floating you know spaced out but it's really good edible overall guys and for something to just kind of walk down the street if you will and eat which is illegal so don't do it but yeah it's a very concealable very discreet way of getting high you know around people or you know around around nobody just to do yourself if you don't like smoking cannabis or anything like that this lollipop would be great for you guys that's gonna be it for the mixed berry mile-high sucker review guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up below

coming out of Northern California humble area and distributed out of Sacramento those of you in the Sacramento area in northern Cali area can obviously get all of them and if not you can get ahold of me and I could point you in the right direction so these are the peanut butter caramels and I spoke with the Baker which goes by Maria Jane Maria Jane and they're made with peanut oil so the peanut butter cookies are made with peanut oil oh [ __ ] I don't think I'm supposed to tell everybody that it's out its out the bag now so first taste and by the way they're 60 milligram dosage and they're made from extract and not a can of butter not from plant material that's right hmm that's good you can still clearly chase the countess mm-hmm but the peanut butter and the caramel ran Jane said that she makes the caramel in-house she makes it herself so I honestly think that's the best part of the cookie that's for you oh it's very different it doesn't have that salt very clear that she's using she's not using butter she's in the peanut oil if she said so it gives it this I don't want to say nutty because it's it's peanut right but it's giving it yeah like an almond but I go just an off note apart from the peanut butter cookie taste it's it's enjoyable I like it what it's a touch dry touch scribe but you're not drive to where it's a hard cookie or a cracker consistency it's not like that it's still soft it's still moist I like it so 60 mill around 60 she told me the only one but I want to get three and by the way the name is so cool I gave her props like genius name for your edible company hashtag ah cuz she makes it all with pho anyway let's make another one because I'm gonna G and I can do that ooh definitely gonna drink hold still I'll be right back beverage I got coffee but what are you gonna do tomorrow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put another review up this is just a flavor review any cuz this is your review tomorrow I'm going to we'll see how I do tonight probably

Bob's medicated cannabis lollipop it's a 40 milligram THC lollipop I'm gonna be your flavored it's a hybrid by the package never had one of these before that everyone told me they're really good it's actually a pretty big lollipop can't really taste the fact that it's medicated which is a big plus for me because I don't really like the Medicaid taste and I got root beer and it really really tastes like root beer so oh no I have to say pretty good review I like it so far stay tuned for more thank you for watching join me on Fort Wayne nurse comm be my fan follow my Instagram", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "9GxyAg27DrY": "hey guys today's edition of mixing at the DIY university it's gonna have a little to do with your startup cost a lot of people are afraid to start DIY because they're afraid of how much it's actually going to cost to get their skit how many flavorings they should get and really honestly you can keep that really really simple and down to basics I am a big believer in the kiss program keep it simple silly something else no we'll just keep it simple so you can start DIY for about the cost of what it would cost you to buy two premium juices for my understanding premium juices are about $30 each a 30 milliliter of course um so about 60 bucks we got wizard lab that you can go to directly because they sell VG they sell PG they sell nicotine and they sell an array of flavors we also have another site that I have used which is one-stop DIY they have flavorings for the most part but the full service another full-service site that will have your nicotine your PG and your flavorings would be Heartland baits they have bottles there too and so does wizard lab they have pets they have all that stuff I recommend that you start maybe with a hundred and twenty milliliter of hundred milligrams nicotine but you can start with the 48 I also recommend that you get at least five hundred milliliter bottle VG if you do the 48 you don't need any PG we do the hundred you might want to get like a hundred and twenty milliliter of PG as well to thin things down or to break down your nicotine if you want to - you have it at a safer place 100 milligram nicotine is dangerous you should use gloves at all times because if you do get it on the skin it does penetrate the skin and it can give you a nicotine rush or nicotine poison if you leave it in there too long so what I would suggest you before I think I've told you get the 120 milliliter of nicotine get 500 milliliters of VG and now for flavorings I think that for the most part almost all vapors like strawberry my recommendation for your flavorings is to start off with the smallest sample size that you can get you get strawberry right from the flavor apprentice or sweet strawberry from Cabela's there you go you got a fruit pick you out a recipe as a matter of fact you know what I'll give you a recipe I'll give you a recipe at the bottom of this video for a cinnamon Danish because that's another one if you like it fruits and custard cinnamon Danish seems to be pretty popular so what you're going to need for that it's Capella's cinnamon Danish or cinnamon roll whatever they call it the v1 version one because that's the one that that will have the thickest flavoring to it you're gonna need some bavarian cream and you can do that cappellas or the flavor apprentice you're gonna need some caramel and that could be again cappellas the flavor apprentice flavor art any one of them you just need a little bit of caramel and you should end in an apple I'd prefer Fuji apple but you can always get TF a green apple or flavor west double apple so there you go I think that with those flavors you would have a strawberry I can make a strawberry and cream with that you can make a cinnamon roll with that I have not put down a vanilla custard I think I'm gonna let Laura give you guys some recipes for some custards and stuff like that but with those two flavors you can basically start an IV or tobacco louver there's only three flavors you really need Turkish from the flavor apprentice or Western I think they call ya western used to call that cowboy from the flavor apprentice and storm from FA you get those flavors you can certainly make some really good tobacco's and they'll be on the cheap because you can go 1% so probably for a total of 60 bucks if you can get all those ingredients I just said now you're only gonna need maybe five syringes and I'm sure you have bottles laying around reused us wash them out reuse them you try to stick with glass for a first because you're gonna the plastic ones will retain the flavor of your old juice in it but the glass ones will be clear if you have any questions send us an email send us a note comment under here and I will be glad to answer it or maybe make a follow-up video again the two sites that I would recommend is going to be wizard live or go to forgot it again Harlan Bates I think I have a bad case of CRS can't remember squat you know that's not what I'm thinking all right guys talk to you later bye", "-_hhZdGhF2Y": "okay today we are going to make cannabis lollipops first things you will need are tempered candy molds to absorb the heat of 350 degree molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "y_0P4nss0AI": "[Music] but everyone this is dragon biscuits again and we are on a roll we are making giant candy for Halloween in our last video we made a giant peanut butter cup and this episode you've seen this there's hard candy in the middle and there's caramel on the outside of it and we're gonna try to make one of these but we're gonna make it giant and here we have our giant sucker stick this is gonna be a big big Center it's gonna be about this size we want it to be the size of these plates okay so the first thing that we need to do is we need to add our sugar corn syrup and water to our hand over here so you bring the water [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the syrup is completely transparent again now so that means that all the sugar is completely dissolved and return it down the heat because I'm gonna do the first cold water test what needs to happen is there needs to be brittle threads that form through the water as you pour it in and it looks like we're our ways off yet it's not even it's not even solidified on the bottom of your cupcake so we need to do another test later we're doing the second second hard water test taking this ice cube ow [Music] okay okay it's getting more solid that's for sure but it still has a ways to go [Music] superhot girls have to be really careful when you're doing these tests it's getting more solid you can see it's turning more into caramel on the bottom you'll see that the streams of the candy are more solid making like spider webs in the bottom of the cup okay this is our another it's getting much harder you can see that it's actually turning into little a little globule of candy [Music] it's not hard enough to really stay together though as a cohesive blob [Music] if you can see that there's like bubbles forming on the bottom of the spoon it's still so hot and it retains its heat so well [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah so now it's turning into it's getting harder no longer sticking to my finger as I touch it a little ball of candy you see it kind of like stringing through the water do stretchy look at that [Music] yeah we're getting really close this is nice and gummy now but we don't have those hard crisps little brittle strands that are running through the water which is what we did that got yourself a little bit of yummy candy [Music] go white you see those strands in there I think it might be ready look at that look how awesome at it so this is your hard candy it's still a little flexible it's not brittle so it needs a little bit more time punches off can you hear crackling [Music] [Applause] and the awesome it's like a little roller coaster like an elaborate slide breaking on pretty easy now alright so we just added our apple flavoring and we added some green dye to make it nice and green apple II so you can see and it's setting up so right now we are going to pour it carefully because it's very hot into our plates this out of the way so our plan since this is going to be huge is we're gonna put we're gonna put the candy on a plate and maybe we're gonna kind of gently put one half of the stick into the into the candy that's hardening [Music] I'm so high and you just feel the heat coming off of it [Music] we're just gonna press this stick right in the middle of it boy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know we needed more candy so we just are adding our second layer to cover up this stick so that it will stay in when we pick it up you can see that this is actually a different color green than the first one you're gonna hopefully be able to put them over it [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] interesting [Music] dear [Applause] [Music] okay so we managed to loosen up our sucker with this knife and with this fork and we're going to take it off the plate gently not by the stick yet because it's a little bit it's still squishy you can still squish it on your hand it's still pretty hot [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's pruning time so as you can see we made it pretty proportionate so this is the size of the normal ones that you can buy this board and this is our giant one that is still setting and we haven't got any caramel on the underside yet you can see but it's we're just gonna have to wait for it to get more solid before we can pour the other side of the caramel [Music] you guys okay so we added caramel to the front side first then you put it in the fridge or the freezer and then we took it out caramel on the other side it looks like it's staying on the stick pretty good I was kind of afraid that it would be floppy and fall off but it is very solid cellophane [Music] [Music] pounds and fluid entire pounds and ounces so it is three pounds and 15 ounces 15.8 okay all right all right so it's time to give our giant sucker a rating I think that could be dressed a little better but it was fairly easy to do we had some problems with with the amount of candy that we needed for this mostly because we just have never done this before so we fill up our plate of course whipping and then that was pretty much it we didn't have enough candy to put the stick on and then put more candy on top of it was out so we had to make more candy so that was a little bit complicated so I think that I would give this board dragon biscuits because it was just candy it was pretty easy to me I might give this three dragon biscuits because candy is I think I probably give this our 4 so basically the same and so yeah if you want a giant sucker for one [Music] then you guess you can make this don't forget to like and subscribe and if you like this video go check out some of our other videos [Music]", "4MD06UCMUd8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and I know I'm really close but there's a reason for it I'm gonna do an edible review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "MqSH3tuiqTA": "[Music] hey guys so welcome back to another boutique Friday video this one I've been talking about I have wanted to eat this so badly ever since I got it and it's been killing me leaving it alone till today I kept meaning to review it for a while but also hesitating to review it because thinking about how am I going to do this where the perverts of the Internet aren't going to have a field day with my reviewing this it's nothing bad but it is a lollypop so I'm just like oh boy how badly do I wonder if you how badly do I want to open that Pandora's box we're going there don't do it just hold your freaking comments just don't do it man so this is a limited edition See's candy lollipop in caramel apple they only sell these during the autumn part of the year I've never had one of these but like their other lollipops I freaking love so I have no doubt in my mind this will be amazing I've learned there's scotch Mallos too or their caramel apple scotch mellows dude kind of wish I bought a pound of them now I not be able to resist looks exactly how I just like this this is what they always look like for those of you who do not have a See's candy near you or I've never bought the lollipops from them so it almost looks like it has condensation marks on here but hopefully it's still okay it's not very old I mean when did I go to the mall like a month ago something like that so I mean I'm pretty sure the lollipops stay good at least that long I definitely smell both apple and caramel there that is impressive I've had like the cafe au lait ones I've had the chocolate ones I've had the dark chocolate ones I've had the butterscotch ones and I want to say there's at least one more that I've had but they're all amazing I used to get them for Easter from my grandparents they were always so good which am i smelling more that is really 5050 I feel like but it's not like really super strong so I'm interested to see how it will be don't that really is 5050 between the two flavors it's really good too in addition to both apple and caramel I almost feel like there's the tiniest hint of like artificial banana in there too I'm not sure if that's coming from the Apple or not but um it's pretty good though it's very rich which I mean kind of knew going in it was gonna be there lollipops always are that's why I only bought one I was like I only need one but um it's really good I think I'm gonna eat this and come back because I feel rude eating this on camera just even though it's squares not around what or anything guys I mean I just I feel weird with it so I'm gonna come back and tell you my thoughts alright so stay tuned okay now that I'm done with that and no more room is to be made fun of or anything I can raid it talk whatever so for as rich as it was I think it was the perfect amount for just one lollipop because once it's done you feel satisfied you don't really want more but at the same time it was enough you know it just it wasn't like too much or anything it was like the Goldilocks zone uh but just enough of each of the things and throughout the whole thing it really did stay a perfect 50/50 of both flavors throughout which i think is incredibly rare for things like that so that was kind of cool and unlike some of the other See's Candies lollipops this one didn't leave like a weird film on my tongue or anything afterwards it just when it was done it was done it was light enough to where it didn't like really hang out or taint anything else I wanted to eat or drink afterwards or anything just satisfying in the moment lasted long enough to eat it but at the same time didn't take like forever to eat it like say a Tootsie Pop or anything I just I think they're just the right amount personally but that is just my opinion so I think I would rate a good 5 out of 5 I think it was perfect in pretty much every possible way only weirdness just the square shape of them which is true of any of them from that Brandis it's a little bit weird in your mouth because it hits your teeth with the corners so I mean but I mean other than that totally not deal-breaker cuz you could just you know put just the tip don't don't hear you thinking it you think loudly but you could put just the tip of it in your mouth and do it that way which can be easier but anyway I think it's really good I highly recommend them I think they're still selling the flavor right now I don't know for how much longer since it is not tamil flavor I'm sure very soon they'll be replacing it with Christmas flavors so if you want to try one I suggest you get to it See's candy location and see if they've still got him if they do great if not my apology such missed it anyways that is it for this one so as usual you guys like this video go ahead keep

marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary so what are we reviewing this week brand new brand we're looking at just dab bytes cookies-and-cream 120 milligrams my guess is it as a cereal bar like so many other edibles it's quite large for a cereal bar this first time ever having anything from just dab so I'm looking forward to it you can see the ingredients there on the back are a little sparse cereal marshmallow butter vanilla extract crafted on May night not much else to stay of this other than the dumb 120 milligrams is in like the creepy font for some reason so let's just couldn't open it up and get straight to it if I can figure out how to open up this package I wouldn't be getting straight to it so you know oh wait here we go there's the little tear strip yes everybody it looks like a rice krispies treat with some Oreo in it looks good no well there is a weed owner but not too bad there's a lot of Oreo odor as well let's go and have a bite that's not so good it's dry and it's not chewy and moist and like when you bite it doesn't come across like cheese like the best rice krispies it's like has that gooey texture does not have that it's pretty and look the steel or you on the inside does not go well with the marshmallow rice oh it's not terrible but I don't love it um so that's the just dab bytes cookies and cream not so good not so hot in terms of the taste Department but as we all know the most important thing is not how it tastes but how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna have to come back to you in two hours to let you know how this just dab bar is working I'm gonna finish this bad boy up and I will see you guys then peace hello everyone welcome to wheats it's been two hours since I had the just dab bytes hundred and twenty milligram cookies and cream breakfast bar um and it's alright it's not great it was didn't taste great that's for sure they messed up the thing that seems to be very difficult to mess up which is like a rice krispies bar wasn't that tasty this kind of dry and stale tasting but I am I'm not disappointed with how high I am for 120 milligram in a bowl I'm not outrageously high but I'm pleasantly stoned about in line sort of right on the average end of 120 milligrams at a bowl a price range about what you would expect that as well ten to twelve dollars depending on the day so yeah did it taste as good as I was hoping I mean it wasn't disgusting by any means it's no enjoy goldfish or Korova salted caramel but it just wasn't great but the high is is is is okay so I'm gonna give this one a pass don't love it don't hate it looking forward to trying some other things from them I think I've got a cookie coming up in the queue to review from them looking forward to that now so with that that should do it for this episode here on weeks I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace terrible I mean it hit the camera but it's still bad bye hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the

there and welcome back to cooking with Marc today we're gonna make caramel apple lollipops hard candy it's very easy to make all you're going to need is a half a cup of corn syrup a cup of granulated sugar an eighth of a teaspoon of extra strength apple flavor and 1/8 of a teaspoon of caramel flavoring let's get started here so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to add 1/2 cup corn syrup into your measuring cup and then you're gonna add your sugar and we're gonna add the caramel flavor to this beforehand however the the extra strength Apple is not going to go in until afterwards that's going to be the last thing we're going to add in now all you're gonna do is you're gonna mix this up until your sugar is completely dissolved for this we're actually going to use a fork now if you look at this you'll see that it's almost like a paste which is exactly what you want I get this all stirred now what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in the microwave for 3 minutes while that's doing that we're gonna use these now these you can pick up at your craft stores all they are are lollipop hard candy trays shells [Music] now I did pick up two of these and I happen to find another one I want to try I love working with silicone so I actually have a silicone one here as well the silicone one you don't do anything with these you have to spray down with cooking spray the silicone ones you don't you're just gonna fill these up now after you take that out for three minutes you're gonna after it cooks for three minutes you're going to take it out stir it up put it back in for another three minutes and stir it the next time it comes out you're gonna let it sit for about ten seconds and then you're gonna add your apple flavoring to it now the other thing that you want to make sure that you add is make sure you spray these down with cooking spray as I said you don't the spray these down these you just pour right into the molds you're also going to need lollipop sticks now you want to make sure that the continuing use for your microwave is microwave safe for very high hot temperature because your candy mixture is actually going to be in there for about six minutes [Music] so we've got this in here now all you're going to do is just simply pour this in to your trays lake cell [Music] now once you do that simply take your sticks and this has to be done at just the right time and turn your stick around into the mixture so that it it sets in and make sure you turn it and this doesn't take that long to set so you want to make sure you do this just right and that's all you're going to do we're going to do the rest of these and you're going to let this set anywheres from two hours to overnight now after they gets this gets done all you're gonna do is coat it with powdered sugar so that it doesn't stick when you put it in your bag ease and then you seal them up with a twist tie which I did buy those as well and then we're just going to do the same thing on these and make sure you turn this now if you do put too much in here you will see that it will run down the side so you want to make sure that you put enough in but not too much and keep in mind that this is candy so is it extremely hot the best way to actually do this is to take your stick and dip it into the lollipop and twist it and then press down because then once you do that it'll actually wrap around the lollipop you just have these to do sort of beside these over now as I stated these don't have to be coated now if you wanted to if you had leftovers you could actually take the leftover and put it in a tray well that was too much too much there so anyways you could put it in a tray and let it harden that way and then again with these all you're going to do just simply take your sticks and twist it now if there are small pieces they do not take that long to harden if their heart if their bigger pieces they will take a little bit longer so just keep that in mind now if you're putting this in a tray all you have to do is just put it in your tray let it harden and then break it into little pieces and you can have little pieces of hard candy and you can add any flavor you want to this as you can see these are all done it's caramel apple lollipops hard candy everything was bought at a hobby shop except for the sugar in the corn syrup I bought that at Walmart the other stuff was bought at a Seymour's or Hobby Lobby if you have any questions the video is going to be up on my website it's also going to be up on my Facebook page my Twitter account as well as my YouTube account it's cooking with marcom or my facebook page cooking Widmark thank you for watching and have a good day now", "q8WLTi_4wGk": "what is up reviewees we've got another one on the old uh review board i mean come on spell it out for us nuh style caramel apple pops are you kidding [Music] welcome to the review board sit right down and just enjoy needing on steak before you go out and buy these are the guys welcome to the review sit right down and just enjoy [Music] he's never had one before look you can't open it i'm trying try i'm not making that up you can't open these things oh whoa look at i mean come on is that edible yeah and you're gonna try it never had one before first time for you guys on the review board i mean i'm not gonna do it my teeth would not handle that but there would literally be no coming back from that so we got the nine-year-old for that i mean i was probably nine when i first had one of these hayride fall foliage everywhere schumacher farms picking pumpkin patch schumacher farms nostalgia spell it out lincoln you know you you probably still go there he's not tried yet because he's scared oh these are brains we may get in trouble for trying these this is the things i do for the review board i mean brynn has no idea we're doing this what do you think good good it's weird right i mean it's definitely fall foliage cold bitter boop but i mean i i that's a sign because this one was mine and i can't even get it open so but for the kind one like a little fun fact these are gluten free peanut free really random fact these are sold by volume not by the piece so the tootsie roll company sells this another interesting fact dan walker invented these in the 1950s he was a representative a sales rep for craft so i mean accidentally created these after halloween had some extra caramel laying around threw a apple in it and said i don't know i didn't understand that wikipedia can't trust at all that's why you have us ray what do you think it's good and i'm reading this okay at 7 points one seven one not a rookie score good number good score i i honestly have had these before it's a little low if you ask me these are definitely these are an eight five in my book all day every day slept on candy slept on candy um yeah that's gonna be it for us here at the uh review you notice but how are we eating them that's a review this action this is behind the scenes footage of what they have to do to get the best review board we couldn't sit over there", "fSGq7yNpGmM": "alright guys it is Kearney the next day and today I thought I kind of shared you guys exactly how I track my calories americo's on an app on my phone called My Fitness Pal so if you're brand new to tracking your calories or americo's and you have absolutely no idea how to do it this is the video for you because I'm going to show you guys exactly how I do it on my phone so honestly you just give you guys some context I've been doing this for I don't know how many years exactly but I've been doing it since ok I don't really feel comfortable saying this but I've been doing this since I was in grade 9 so I think I was like 14 years old then so yeah honestly like I do not recommend you guys to start when you're that young when you're that young obviously just enjoy your life eat whatever you want to eat unless you're obviously like obese but honestly you should not worry about tracking calories or macros ever that young however I do feel like it's a good life scald a half especially in the long term because obviously you don't want to be tracking every single thing you eat for the rest of you like however if you just know how many calories are in certain foods and kind of set yourself up to kind of eat intuitively for the rest of your life so again it's such a great life skill to have just kind of get used to it do this for like maybe one to two weeks then after that just kind of like eyeball things such as what I've been doing ever since and I seen great results so anyway I'm gonna show up now and let's get into it alright guys now the two things you need to know before you start tracking your calories are matter coats are number one you need to obviously know how many calories and microbrews you need per day because if you don't know that then it's like what are you doing and secondly you need a food skill I mean you can probably use like measuring cups these twelve words probably not that accurate so using a electric food scale definitely helped out a lot and there's only like 15 bucks at Walmart so definitely it's a great investment to make well alright so we've got the skill right here we're gonna put the bowl on top and now let's open up our pad MyFitnessPal app so it has breakfast lunch dinner snack so I just go for breakfast and now what I like to do is for like any meats I pre cook my chicken breasts I pre cook whatever meat I have then I'll just basically wade out precooked so basically you just go into search and search chicken breasts how about mine on warm on it so let's see there's Walmart chicken breast so I like to go for 100 grams so one on igano chicken breast is 107 companies we're just about right so what we're gonna do is basically we're gonna grab our chicken breasts know with the ball on top we're gonna put the scale on on Justin outside the zero right basically over gotta do is just some chicken breasts until we're just 100 grams so when our bread 3165 99 grams now with the chicken breasts I'm gonna be adding 200 grams of precooked rice so again jameth the chicken i precooked my rice as well so basically just going to MyFitnessPal this is what my your eyes so look for a pre cooked basmati rice and just look for it for 200 grams and just add that into your scale so we're gonna put the skill back to zero so now it's back to zero now we can out rice 172 one of you six about 200 grams of rice right here so that's super simple super easy way to track your chicken Reisman all right set it up the meal right here so 200 amps of rice and 100 mg of chicken breast everything is precooked and now if you look at the calories and macros of this meal 370 calories 25 grams of protein 61 grams of carbs and 3 grams of fats quick little solid pre-workout meal so I'm gonna eat this then we're gonna head over to the gym and yeah that's right okay so on my way to the gym or no and I'm actually gonna go stop by a supplement store because I heard of her knee they got the new HTML so pre workout and I heard a lot of good things about them so quickly drive over there and see what they got okay updates so I've pretty much been looking for like 10 15 minutes and I haven't found it so like I'm just sitting outside of parking lots just outside of the gym so I'm yeah I may have to go in there with no free workout which kind of sucks because I was expecting to have some stimulants inside of my body but I don't have any so that kind of sucks but I'm also sitting next to a grocery store so I may go in there maybe pick up some weird cheap pre-workout which doesn't really sound that good but anyway I'm trying to work out with no pre-workout that's okay that we're selling that smash it so let's go alright so I just came back from the mall and basically the social oh my phone exactly where it was because I didn't want to pay for stupid cheap Walmart the pre-workout so I kind of know where it is right now I'm not - sure but anyway we're gonna keep searching because I am determined to find that sore and get the pre-workout because like I kind of like I just want to do it man so we're gonna keep jamming keep searching for it and we will find it mission accomplished we got the pre workouts the pre HD and he gave me a free stringer bag and a shaker dollar shaker bodies mutant clubs were just pretty a nice gesture so sick anyway this is what I came here for the pre HD looks so so you got the sour gummy ther because I've heard a lot of good things about this you guys know I'm not a big fan of like supplement stimulants whatever but honestly like you gotta try it man so I never gonna try this one out right now now we're gonna finally go into the gym but I can open this thing okay this is pissing me off man open there we go okay why is this such a difficult task this is what's inside it smells pretty good so I was like sour gummies a scoop is pretty big like that's pretty big for a scoop so I'll definitely only be doing half about that so yeah that's going in here shake this sucker up dust not really good that's good really good so anyway drink this now all to the gym [Music] you want to get on with it breaking through that smoking is poppin trust see clear [Music] all right so the workout is done just did a poll workout so back and biceps and a bit of rear delts as well so now I'm gonna go back home I need some food oh and one more thing about the pre workouts okay to be honest the taste wasn't that good like it really wasn't was a bit like bitter didn't really have that I don't know if I mixed too much water in it or I put too much pre-workout in it I don't know just the taste wasn't it was a bit off its own seat and probably like five out of ten to be honest and I don't know what it was but I didn't really feel it it's like I took one scoop and I probably should have taken two which was I think the recommended serving size but either way it didn't really feel it that much which kind of sucks but yeah whatever poor guy so post-workout I'm craving something sweet so I'm gonna be making a protein shake here's how all right so you'll need is milk protein powder and frozen bananas now when it comes to foods that already have food they will zone them like as you can see here so for this kind of milk one serving this one cup we're just 250 millilitres that's pretty easy to measure so all you got to do for the liquid you can definitely use mic measuring cups for consistency I'm still gonna be using my food skills so really simple again all you got to do is just put your blender on top of the scale and then turn it on so now it's at zero right you know we got to do is just have 250 millilitres Oh No so I'll stop what if it's 250 I know when it comes to bananas you still got red bananas because obviously they're all in different sizes some are obviously bigger than others this is obviously bigger than this one for example guys keep in mind I don't do this every day I'm not too picky when it comes to these kind of things about just for an example to show you guys this is how you do it properly so we'll take one of our slogans banana so that's a pretty big one to be honest see how much it weighs a brilliant piece s so it blends easier holy that banana is 163 grams us a lot because a normal sized banana would be like 100 220 grams so that was pretty big protein powder guys these scoops a serving size for protein powder is obviously one scoop so it's here one scoop is 25 grams so if we measure that properly all right so this is about one scoop let's see if it's actually 25 grams because often it's usually a lot more so let's see that single scoop was 30 grams and set up 25 grams so yeah keep that in mind so anyway that's all you need really you can have like cinnamon or vanilla extract which have no calories so you can do that if you wanted to but I'll be gonna do nellis blend it up and drink it one by the way these flavor jumps I go from my protein as well and are absolutely delicious I got the vanilla flavor and easily gonna have zero calories so you can definitely put this in like your oatmeal your coffee or tea pretty much anything you want to sweeten up so yeah that's good let's blend it up also you can have some ice if you want to like make it like more volumous Paragon so as you can see this could probably make like two of these classes so yeah a lot of volume in the shake which is really nice if you're trying to lose weight because obviously it'll make you feel full with not a lot of calories so yeah scoop that taste test that's really good I used two salted caramel flavor from my protein that's so sweet so it definitely goes well on the shake but I mean anyway I'm gonna enjoy this and then see you in the next meal okay so these are all the ingredients you will need to make a super good sandwich so this is gonna be a tuna sandwich and they got some of this thread from Mayo pickles sriracha cilantro and - nose - all right so for this red pepper one serving which is 75 grams 210 calories longer methods 42 carbs 7 grams of protein so I'm gonna be using the rest of this bread so what you can do is actually a barcode right here which you can scan on my fitness ball so let me show you all right so obviously you're gonna be opening up my Fitness Hall again let it load so this is gonna be dinner go to dinner and that will top the barcode scanner thing try to scan it there you go see that matches up I mean it's like most of this stuff is gonna be kinda off most of the time but honestly like as long as you are consistent the inconsistent that's all that matters so basically it says for 75 grams is 210 calories that see how heavy this is let's go right here on top that's 152 grams for that so we're gonna put in 152 which is about 477 calories so yeah alright guys so this cameras about the dice so I hope I can finish this really quick so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna drain this tuna is so I'm gonna be using the full count which is 120 calories then I'm just gonna be adding a little bit of this which has minimal calories and then once service of this mayonnaise which has 40 [Music] or goes I apologize my camera died there stupid sorry but I mean I'm gonna show you guys my last and final meal we're just gonna be my bowl of oatmeal and so yeah let's get into it so we got some oatmeal right here per half a cup 40 grams there's only 50 calories so we're gonna be doing two servings which is 80 grams Feenie gram just gonna be adding some water to that about that much and I've got some salt and now essentially all that salt really does it doesn't make the oatmeal salty just enhances the flavor so I definitely recommend you guys adding salt to your oatmeal because it just brings the flavor to life especially if you have like sweetness so like honey protein powder whatever alright so once the old meal is finished I'm gonna be adding one serving of these frozen blueberries so again really easy to poke on the back of the label and they'll see calories America lives right over here so for one serving hundred and forty grams I'm actually gonna be using half of a serving probably like 70 grams because that's a lot these are just serving sizes you don't have to follow exactly your serving size because sometimes they're a lot more than you want and sometimes they're less than you want so don't you just do it depending on what your calories and macros are because of course everyone's are gonna be different these are just like you recommend it serving sizes which I'm sure no one Falls but that's just a good guide to follow so we'll be adding ones through this salted-caramel protein powder so this is like a normal scoop and normal person would take right well let's see how much does this know twenty-five actually okay yeah last time I probably use too much but yeah both the serving is about 25 grams which is what they say right over there as well so yeah all right so now that the oatmeal is mixed all together one final and really important thing I want to show you guys is this peanut butter so how do you track peanut butter so per serving this 15 grams I'm gonna be using 30 grams with how do you measure that I'm gonna show you guys right now before I used to track my calories americo's I used to look at the back of this table and say for one tablespoon this 90 calories so I thought to myself okay one tablespoon this is how much I'd actually use right as I can double tablespoon that's about the tablespoon right it's like pretty normal however if you look at the skill right now it is 34 grams which is well over two servings so just a little bit of this it's two servings so yeah just keep that in mind guys and so that's how I would recommend you guys to actually measure any peanut butter jams nut butters whatever is to put your peanut butter on the scale put it on zero and then basically use the negative amount so if it's a negative thirty and they said you took 30 grams out of it so yeah there's a quick little tip for you guys want to be putting this into here all right so this is the final meal of the day and I'm gonna gather some cinnamon on top which is zero calories by the way so that's gonna wrap up the entire video I hope this video made sense you guys I hope you guys took something out of it because honestly it's pretty simple especially after you've done it for a while so honestly if you've never done before I would highly recommend you guys to try it for at least maybe a week or two just to get the hang of it learn about the calories of Marko's learn about the serving sizes learn about how many calories certain foods have learn about like just all these kinds of things and it's really important because once you know this you'll know it for the rest of your life and they're just really important to know especially when you're going out to eat out to restaurants to parties and you just look at something and say oh that has about 500 calories and oh this has like 300 calories let me go for a lower calorie option just like making Goods wise food options while going out to eat whatever is a great life skill to house so anyway I sincerely hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please be sure to go give this video a thumbs up how do you appreciate it subscribe to my channel if you're new and I'll see you guys in the next one peace out", "T3xgRZfAEak": "how to make sea salt caramel lollipops [Music] hello everyone starting off with a medium-sized saucepan and in the saucepan you'll place one cup of white granulated sugar activat 2 tablespoons or an ounce of water a teaspoon of lemon juice a teaspoon of sea salt and a quarter cup of white or light colored corn syrup the addition of the corn syrup will help keep it from crystallizing too quickly and will make mixture smoother now stir this together over medium-high heat until it starts to boil once this starts the ball you're gonna add in 1/4 cup or four tablespoons of butter a little bit at a time so what I did is I took some cold butter cut it into cubes and then I'm just adding one one or two cubes at a time and stirring until the butter is melted and I continue to add the butter until it was completely combined in there and then you're gonna cook it on medium high boiling it until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack candy stage and be careful when it starts to change color that's when you know you're getting close to the correct temperature and if you start getting some scorching you may have to move it off the heat a little bit but chances are it'll coincide almost exactly when it starts to get the caramel color as the time it'll be at the right temperature once it gets to be the right temperature take it off the heat and stir in a teaspoon of vanilla extract now you're gonna spoon your hot caramel mixture into some candy molds these are special molds just for high temperature candy making do not use those clear plastic ones that use for chocolate molding because they'll just melt they'll lose their shape make sure you get the hard candy ones I actually found mine online so just to Google hard candy mold you probably get quite a few buying options if you can't get them at your local hobby store i greased these molds very lightly with a little bit of cooking spray prior to filling them in I put in the candy sticks and when you're filling the mold make sure that you cover the stick with caramel so that it's nicely put together I did some heart molds I did these happy face molds these ones are probably a little bit too big for caramel cuz the caramel is a little it takes a little long time to eat compared to regular hard candy I get some little round ones which I think are the perfect size for this type of candy let them Harden and then don't pull them up by the sticks flex the mold a little bit and if they should just pop out quite nicely now if you like and I recommend it sprinkle on it's just a little bit more sea salt on top of the lollipops when they're done that salt will stick to them and you will have a really nice treat sweet and salty together is a amazing flavor and these are absolutely delicious they taste a lot like the Werther's original caramel candies if you've ever had those now store these in between layers of plastic wrap and make sure that you lay them flat I found that you stand them up oh after 2 or 3 days especially the large ones like these happy face ones they will start to droop over a little bit because all the caramel is hard it's not super hard and will Bend with gravity over a couple of days but I doubt that these will last this long because they're really good I hope you give them a try now if you don't have a hard candy mold or don't want to buy them or don't have the money to buy them there is another way and I've made lollipops without a mold in the past so here's the video on your screen right now if you want to go take a look this would work with the caramels as well but the finish on your candy may not accept that extra little sprinkle of salt after because of the cornstarch go and check this out if you're interested thanks for watching", "BerAhpBVRJM": "hey everybody I just I wanted to tell you guys a persons and just candies good just caramel and poor suckers this could happen", "eyIcE-0zv_E": "[Music] marijuana's edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary in my left hand today I have a bunch of peanut butter M&Ms not because we're here to review peanut butter M&Ms and not because I just like peanut butter M&Ms although I do I'm using them as a vessel for fat today fat for the Voodoo sours medicated candy this is a new product from voodoo sours conspicuously it does not have a milligram labeling on it maybe because uh they are liars and they're what they pretend to be 375 milligrams is not and instead of lying they just decided not to advertise it at all so I guess we'll just have to guess I believe this cost me $10 at my dispensary if you look at the back you can see that the gummies have some little smiley faces on them and their little rainbow flavors booty sours I've always liked their logo even though I have always found their products last black luster pretty cool little logo so first I'm gonna down these peanut butter M&Ms with a little sand on them mmm crunchy Oh hmm I'm gonna just like my dog over there and I'm gonna be shooting out okay so the peanut butter M&Ms are down even with saying they are still good but we all know peanut butter M&Ms are good what we don't know if it's good or voodoo sours medicated candy rainbow flavored my dog starting to eat a little anxious he wants me to throw my frisbee so I'll get right to it guys if this is the first time you've tuned into wheats the way our reviews workers all eat these gummies may or may not eat all of them in front of you on camera just don't want to bore you to death depending on how long it takes and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review so here we go blue and a green [Music] hmm they taste great I actually thought the voodoo sours there their rainbow belts and they're sour belts tasted really good as well but they never really got me high so I'm hoping that that's not gonna be the case with this generally gummy edibles taste pretty bad at appears infused creations I find them all to have that sort of just kind of almost acidic weed aftertaste these just taste like candy no we taste whatsoever you're good but will they get me [ __ ] up and for that guy cuz I have no idea what they even proclaim to be let's say they're 375 milligrams just like their belts there's same price so I will see you guys in two hours to let you know whether Buddhist ours is gonna grow in my estimation or continue to plummet see you guys then thanks for watching weeds peace alright two hours later with the blue magic actually there's no magic in this voodoo sours unless it's black magic or the magic of them lifting money from your wallet and putting nothing there in return I'm gonna I'm in a full-out feud with voodoo sours at this point one may have the audacity not to list the there milligram dosage on this bag and two it does cover their ass because they probably didn't put it in there because uh there are no milligrams now you might say wheats you look a little high right now you are acting a little high and you'd be right I will confess I did just have a little bit of a bag I baked a bag of weed about half an hour ago because I was tired of just you know feeling nothing I was really hoping to feel something so I apologize I sort of besmirched my review process here but I can assure you Bruce ours was not getting to get me high I am entirely sober at this point I'm somehow more sober than I was when I started this process and I was stoned sober boy voodoo sours just avoid them man uh they the bizarre thing is they seem to be quite popular too just looking at my own video datafeed voodoo sours have used them before in experiments and and then I've reviewed them as well and they're some of my most popular videos so I assume that means that the kid is popular and I have no idea why unless for some reason it just works on everybody else and there the magic sauce is missing on me but I am not kidding you I this is this is I feel nothing not one iota total pass from me the Buddhist hours medicated candy rainbow flavor big stinky wet fart actually so much of a big stinky went for bringing it out the first time in a while [Music] [Applause] that's the one I was waiting for that's the kind of fart that this voodoo showers are skip them if you see them guys thank you so much for watching this episode of week's next time I promise we'll have something better because I don't think we could have something much worse oh well I tell you what it still tasted pretty good well who knows alright guys that's gonna do it for weeks thank you so much for watching we'll catch you in the next review peace that's an okay one hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "x6yyR6PMV3I": "Kevin and I are going to try these Jolly Rancher lollipops these are the normal Apple I'm sure they've been around for a while they don't say no but we haven't tried it before each sucker yeah I call up cyclers and our lollipops that's just what we call them in our area suckers each one is 50 calories and you get about 20 sectors in the bag so it's not a good happy this is how the packaging looks and I didn't know it till I read on the back these are made by the Hershey Company I just think that's interesting well Hershey's you know you always think of chocolate you don't think of hard candy or at least I don't drumming yeah I'm giving more driving salads we didn't review on them we didn't review on the shoes the Jolly Rancher shoes were there hard on the outside and they have a soft center so we're kind of trying to see if these tastes different or if they taste exactly the same Kevin for job I think it's more comely and I can't get my open so we will be back when I can get my number hey Soph only got mine open and I quit watching traffic I was watching traffic too I'll have to admit we're in the car but I couldn't get it open either it took two hands to get the thing else it's a paranoid passenger well you can talk until what you think well I'm getting my first leg I don't wanted to persuade your I think they're good they definitely have an apple caramel flavor you kind of got a like eight says but you got to like lick all over it to get the flavors mixed together but they are a pretty good snack I mean it was last year little waffle Owens you're not biting it it would last you a while for 50 collars it's not too bad for for like a sweet it would probably lash in 15 minutes or so if you're just just not biting on chewing on it I think they're pretty good I think it's very very good if I don't know if they join makes just caramel suckers but if they don't they should because very good caramel if they don't make caramel they should consider it and but that is really really good a lot of times though adults it's just not professional to walk into some place with a sucker in your hand you know you just don't do it it's not something you do you put a mint in your mouth or a piece of gum and then even then you try to be discreet and you don't want to pop it in your mouth and all that so but for a nighttime snack right for a nighttime snack or in the car for keeping in the car or something like that and this would be great they're very very good they have a really good flavor so I would recommend them definitely so thanks for watching", "3j5Qe4EHdj8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what is up everyone hello hello hello welcome to live mixing happy happy Friday I hope everyone has had a wonderful week I hope you all have enjoyed all of the content that has come out of the I why or died this past week how is everyone doing it is Friday hopefully you're getting out of work and if not hopefully you're watching at work and you're waiting for that clock tick from the west coast you probably got a couple more hours to go hang in there the weekend is almost here if you're working on the weekend I feel yeah we've all been there working on the weekend sucks but you got to get that money man you got to get that you got to get that paper you got to get paid right you got to do what you got to do put food on the table you got to get the kids shoes you know give your wife jewelry stuff like that and not all cost money so you got to work sometimes on the weekend I have a lot of work to do this weekend as well but that's okay that's okay so first off before we get into anything I have an awesome announcement to you all to everyone watching if you're watching on the replay this is an announcement for you as well I am releasing a new line of concentrates new line of one-shots and it's super duper simple so let me explain really quickly you can head over to ecig express comm and pick up the new annual reck law lair line right now if there's only one right now there's only elizabeth's Kuster but you're gonna get two more you're gonna be getting a candy starburst enhancer so basically any sort of fruits that you like you just drip this little enhancer in there boom it tastes like starburst you're also hopefully going to be getting another one that well you are gonna be getting another one it's just hopefully it's soon it's taking me a little bit longer than than I'd like to finish this last recipe but the first one's done and we're just gonna be releasing that one really soon right now the one that's released is Elizabeth's custard which is my traditional vanilla third it's a one-shot as well so you can mix this up at it's recommended percentage I think it's thirteen and a half percent is what I recommend it at it's probably it's definitely on the bottle I don't know I guess it's not in here either but essentially just a very traditional simple vanilla coaster is delicious and you can vape it on its own or you can use it as a layer or as a flavoring and you know drip on top of it put your favorite fruits on top maybe you want to put it into a bakery it's meant to be mixed with to kind of bridge the gap between people who like one-shots and they're new they just mix up the one shot they give it a shake and they vape but maybe they want to start getting into tweaking things then now there's the layer line which will help kind of bridge that gap and then hopefully move them over into the more advanced side right now they're really getting into you know individual flavorings flavor profiles and then so on and so forth so so forth excuse me so I think what's really cool is that if you come to DIY or die for your DIY information you want to learn how to mix you want to learn how to get into this stuff I basically have products as well as information videos and podcasts every single step of the way so we're talking from the person who doesn't even know how to mix they've never mixed before they never they don't know what to do you have all the information that you need on my website all the videos there's podcast dedicated to that and now there's products as well as the one-shots so that'll get you to buying one shots that'll actually get you to mixing it right putting the VG the PG your one shot in shaking it and then you have a delicious product say you want to take another little step you're not ready to fully jump headfirst in there you want to take a little you know you want to go slowly well now we have the layer products and there's also videos podcasts information to kind of bridge that gap as well then you want to get into the advanced side and you want to start making your own recipes I'll guess I would call that the more I would guess I would call that the more advanced side right that when you start making your own recipes then you're you're on the advanced side but you're not necessarily on the professional side so you have the the beginner the the sort of novice and then the advanced and then if you do want professional information if you want to learn how to about learn about creating recipes for commercial clients or creating recipes for your commercial company all that stuff there's also information videos podcasts as well all dedicated towards every single aspect of mixing from that from the the littlest person who knows nothing all the way to the person who can mix up anything right you have information as well as product all across the board I would love to release it you know products products could cater towards professionals who make money in the industry or aiming to make money in the industry it's just a little bit difficult on trying essentially I would have to create a flavoring line I would need my own flavorings for that but I don't know if I have the logistics that manpower since it's just myself to do that at this current moment so I figure let's focus on the novices let's put out the one shots people have been loving them a lot of people have just been using those just to mix you know they just get the one shots they vape it they go that's their recipes that they know they can count on if they don't feel like dabbling and try you know failing at recipes or tweaking things it's just super easy to get something that you want to vape now we have a little bridge you have a complete layer so it's a complete recipe that's meant to be mixed so I've made I made sure that when you add stuff to it you're not over flavoring when you add stuff to it you're not going overboard you know it's it's specifically meant for other ingredients to be put on top of it so I think that's pretty cool head over to e-cig express.com pick it up 999 will get you 30 mils it's a great deal it'll last you a really long time and there's just so much more customizability to it because it is meant to be mixed I would love to do one for water melone as well maybe I'll do that a little bit later sort of like a watermelon layer just because there's not really many good watermelon flavorings out there but that's besides the point so we have this one we're gonna be having a candy enhancer candy burst bomb it's called and then a secret one that as soon as I finish I'm gonna send it over to ISA get seasick Express tell them to put it in production because I'm really excited about that one because there's nothing in the market there's nothing in the market for that profile so hopefully when that comes out you guys will be like yes finally we can we mix with this profile which I'm excited about so that's it yeah that was my little announcement there Elizabeth's custard aka Queens custard I couldn't call it Queens because there's already a Queen's custard but I kind of I'll do a little aka thing so Elizabeth's custard aka Queens custard and y'all rec log concentrates the same great quality same great ease of use same great production that you would come to expect with and y'all rec log concentrates but now as a layer of mine which i think is pretty cool and of course you can always head over to liquid barn comm pick up my tastemaker collection where you can get saw empathy on kings custard the older brother quick strawberry malted milk and water melone as well as chef's flavors if you're over in the UK and as well chefs flavors does can does have Elizabeth's custard and like I said you can see it right here in the in the description it was also this this the same recipe so it's meant to be mixed with so cool super excited about that man alright let's get into it how is it going doing this week if you have any questions you want to ask me this is a great time to ask me make sure you just tag my name in the chat at DIY or die that way I can see it a lot easier it's just it's just helpful for me feel free to ask any any questions that you have what will chat I'll try to get do my best to answer it as thoroughly as possible and I think that's it for housekeeping and making sure you guys know what's up oh and follow me on on Instagram as well I love Instagram been using it a lot been trying to tell you guys hey Instagram is the wave at DIY or dye vaping give me a follow let's chill over there alright let's see if there's any questions right now before we jump into anything gotta say you're Elizabeth custard is outstanding thank you sir Keith Wilson glad you enjoy Keith hopefully you can play around with it use it in recipes that'll really help my sales you know if you guys use my ingredients in recipes that's the best way to sell my flavorings you know so that's I spent a lot of time making sure that you guys can do that alright I got a strong distribution option for your one shots here down under PM me I think I already saw your PM I just have to get back to you've been really busy today but I saw that and and I will I will contact you please bring your candy enhancer to chefs I definitely will definitely will yo may how do you overcome not being motivated to mix lately I've been mixing one shots because I'm just too lazy to come up with something new yeah and that seems to be a lot of people recently have been saying that to me they've been saying hey man I just use your one shots and I don't really mix anymore I've kind of just lost motivation for it and the only way you can really get that motivation back is to take a break just take a break you'll get move it you'll get motivated again in the future I promise you just a little break right now just don't worry about it just don't think about it one day you're gonna come along and be like damn I really I really want to try to make this thing and you'll end up getting back into it again you never forget how that makes us like riding a bike you know what I mean you always have that information in the backyard brain so don't stress don't stress too much unless you're someone who gets paid to do it every day and it's hard for you to make money then you don't really need to worry about it I like to just take a little break you know relax and I I normally enjoy like cooking stuff and and bakery stuff and food shows and websites and stuff like that I read that stuff all the time and a lot of that a lot of that a lot of the time that stuff Khanna is just like cool I wonder if I can turn that into something or if I'm just kind of hanging out I just like an idea pops in my head like like man I wonder if if I can create this profile because no one has done it before you know what I mean it's just don't take it too seriously I think once you take it too seriously which does happen in this in this hobby a lot I see it a lot once you take it too seriously then it just doesn't become fun anymore and that's when you lose the spark that's when you lose that flame and if it doesn't become fun take a break step back from it you'll come back to it eventually and then hopefully it'll be fun again but that's my best advice taking a break is vital especially if you want to like kind of regain your pallet you know if you're constantly just running around vaping all these high concentrated aromas it really does weigh down on your palate so taking a break just vapor all day vape a little bit relax and you'll come back better than ever I promise you what do you recommend for a yogurt base I'm trying to make something that tastes more like those drinkable tube yogurts flavor wise yogurt it was a lot of adapt in it unfortunately if you are someone who doesn't like it tap stay away from it flavor west yogurt is the best yogurt I tried to stay away from it as long as I could but recently I've been using it and all of my strawberries and creams it's just so good and it's not it doesn't have a sour note like TP a Greek yogurt so if you're looking for like those drinkable tube yogurts flavor west yogurt throw some strawberries sweetened they're from capella throw a bunch of sweetener in there throw some marshmallow in there boom look at my booster recipe look at my booster recipe just really leave out the Cheesecake items you know I have acquired a lot of Pina Colada concentrate what can I do to make it more interesting thanks stunts thumb try to do what does Pina Colada it's pineapple coconut and then just alcohol right so I would try to infuse with coconuts difficult cuz anything you put in coconut is gonna taste like a tropical mix so you're kind of just gonna have to exploit it maybe mix it in some papaya some some more really exotic flavors you know like papaya cactus stuff like that see what you can do there but instead of just like going run-of-the-mill Pina Colada try to really take that tropical note and run with it maybe that'll spark some motivation where did you get your shelves at I got them at IKEA they're called the K visible shelves I think they're $25 each a little bit pricey but they're worth it if you have an array I still need more - I have to do that whole bottom row like I have the wonderful avers there I have a whole box of the Losi i have purel m flavors I need to go in there just to mess this is too much too much flavors actually I do need to make an order should we make sure we order flavorings together here I think that would be a good idea I think that would help some people out ordering some flavors right I think that would help some people out so we'll do that and we'll do that in a little bit let me answer some of these questions we'll get what happened to the tastemakers series it's kind of been put on hold a little bit but you will see more of it there was there is supposed to be another episode that was already shot unfortunately there's not much to it there's just not I don't know you'll see you'll see a little bit more of that in the future but it's just been put on hold just a little bit just a little bit any suggestions for organizing your small your DIY set up in small places well this is kind of a small little office and I've been able to make it work but I do have like it's not it's not like a corner of a room like this is its own separate office so that's a little bit different like if you're working in like a small corner of a room your best bet is to maybe do something what I have here but vertical users use that vertical real estate as much as possible so stack these on top of each other vertically that way you can keep everything nice and confined and just yeah just you to utilize the verticality of your room or whatever area you're in that should help you and all you really need is like a at least like a little area of a desk with a scale on it and you really don't need much else you know if you're doing syringes you know then it's just gonna get a little bit Messier you should just get a scale in that case anyway do you have suggestions for recipes like strawberry and cream which she should strawberry from anywhere it's the only strawberry I can taste yeah there's plenty if you go on and all the flavors are illiquid recipes calm and you just search those flavors you'll find tons of recipes with with that ingredient I personally don't enjoy that strawberry as much as you might so I don't use it often I know use it often but maybe do like a gods milk look at skittles is God's milk and instead replace it with the shisha strawberry see if that because the Bavarian cream works well with she's just strawberry so try something with that is there any way to mix up a custard take a custard that tastes like store-bought ultramel custard and not the homemade coaster all coasters out there taste like we've been trying all the Tramel stuff I've been trying ultramel since I've had it when I went to South Africa last year it's a it's a really tough profile I just haven't figured it out it doesn't seem tough either when you taste the ultramel you're like oh this would be perfect as it but there's just this should we've just not done it yet that vanilla just is a is so elusive that specific cream vanilla flavor I personally think like a tiny tiny tiny touch of banana is the answer to that but the problem is is like there's still not that vanilla yeah like that vanilla cream eggy part to it it's a tough it's a tough one oh by the way to those who we've been working on the Duchess for a while we've been trying to figure it out I'm pretty sure this is an ingredient in it the buttercream by flavor-wise when you smell it you'll know what I mean when you smell it you'll know what I mean I haven't messed around with it too much yet but I'm pretty sure that is what gives Duchess that weird flavor that that quintessential Duchess flavor I have to have to play around with it but I'm letting you guys know if I come out with a duchess remix part 6 it's probably gonna include that buttercream so pick it up if you don't have it someone said how about how about a vanilla buttercream frosting for that case maybe use a Lorraine's cream cheese frosting and then use that flavor west buttercream that buttercream is actually pretty it's from what I can smell it smells great can you type that for me please about the shelves yes I can cave izl what do you think about TPA brown sugar I think it's good it's a good accent note I use it usually from like a half a percent up to maybe two percent I never use it as like a main profile it's usually just meant to kind of act as a brown sugar if I want a little bit of that deeper caramel brown sugar note I'll throw that in there a lot of bakeries utilize it sometimes in creams maybe we'll use it in this in this recipe we're gonna be mixing something with vanilla focusing on maybe we'll do the vanilla buttercream frosting today I don't know David hey Wayne much love for your content I'm a member on your website and now the PDF download is no longer available in my downloads is there a way to get it back did you just email me on that I think I just saw that maybe it was an email or if it was something else but someone else said that to me maybe it was a Facebook message after I look into that I'm dead I don't know why it wouldn't be there but someone else also said that the Downloads gone I got a double check I'll get back to you on that do you have any suggestions for 24 millimeter flavor RDAs dual coil configuration just for dripping know I don't really vape that way so unfortunately I don't I do have the new Citadel RDA if you guys have seen my my review on it let's talk about the Citadel was it's uh it's [ __ ] dope let's talk about the Citadel so here it is may bicycling the guys you do the hata Lee video the and Theon now this RDA has been on my mod since it came in and it hasn't I haven't used any other RDA other than the testing that we've done the flavor on it I don't know how they did it well I do know how I did it but I don't know how they keep doing it topping the flavor of the Hat early topping the flavor of the an Theon it's just crazy how good they are at building flavor so what they did was he didn't see the review they put this sort of Ultem chamber reducer on it you can see that and what that does is essentially just really it just the chamber but it just adds to the flavor tremendously it's crazy how good this chamber reducer works and that's what they did they basically kept the design of the hata Li the same right it sort of looks like a Hadley that just has that angled airflow that kind of comes down at the coil you know the horizontal slots on the side keeping it as tight as possible to the top of the coil and then what they did was they even they closed down even more with this chamber reducer and it just produces such a vibrant saturated dance sticky vapor it's awesome highly highly recommend it it's a little bit pricey that's $75 but you're definitely getting a quality quality product it's really great and I actually spoke to Mac the other day he called me the other day the owner of Cyclone and we chatted about the Citadel and yeah he's super proud of it he's super proud of it I'm super happy with it I think it's their best product yet I don't know how they're gonna top this like I really don't know how much further they can go unless they can figure out something where they can keep the same flavor but maybe do it maybe in an RDA that's like a cloud chasing RDA I don't know I don't know how they can top this so they might have to try to you know reach it but I don't know how they could how they were able to top the Hat you know what I mean like I didn't know how if they were able to top the Hat aliy if they were able to top the ante on but they did so there's definitely some elves and magic and Wizardry going on over at this cyclone shop it's pretty crazy it's such a great little RDA it looks great - I have the the beauty ring the in Theon has a bunch of beauty rings and it works with the Citadel which is awesome like it just barely fits it's like perfect I thought well it's a muted flavors for you I thought as well I was a little bit worried about the Ultem chamber reducer on this interfering with the flavor but it doesn't at all I think the problem with Ultem with the Ultem for me is when cuz I can I'll show you so this is the oh Jenny it's an O a D Genesis style tank and I was super excited about this and I'll show you what I mean I notice it the worse with this one so here I have to show you like this so where that cotton is I don't know if you could tell but there is like an ultimate of like separator that can separate the deck from the tank and what happens is it sort of just sits there and I think when the juice sort of sits on it it sorts it's sort of like take some of that flavor from the ol toe and I noticed that the worse with this one and there's also another sort of tank system that I have that utilizes old tum and any it has an Ultima stank at any time I used it I could it just muted the flavor so when I saw that it this was like the old this was like an old how the [ __ ] that is when I saw that this was like an old tub chamber deserves a little bit worried and I think this is the reason why I don't like the wasp because the old Tim top cap as just everything is ultimen this thing maybe there's like different grades of Ultem I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure but I don't notice any sort of flavor from this at all maybe because it's just kind of covering the top right it just reduces it but you'd think that the I don't know I don't know I don't notice it much on here I don't notice it at all on here at all where the wasp they're like I don't think this is a good flavor RDA at all and a lot of people were like hey man check out the wasps you're gonna love it it's a nice cheap good flavor RDA I think it's super muted and I don't like the flavor that I get from it and I have to close it down so it's like this to get any sort of comparable flavor out of it like I really got to close the wasp bound to get any sort of like good comparable flavor from it it's not terrible it's better than some of the cloud chasing RDAs but when you compare it to a Hadley or an ante on it's just not even close and then with the Citadel pretty much anyone that has used it thus far I'm sure will say the same like this is just their best flavor RDA yet it's so good I'm vaping some of the last of this [ __ ] oh my gosh this is not good don't ever buy this stuff not bad but it's kind of weird it's it's just a weird flavor I don't know yeah they said it all though good [ __ ] what kind of bill do you like in yours I have an alien coil in here just a single alien coil Mac uses he says he uses just a regular clapton in his but I have a nice little cool little alien build in here to show you it's at a point to eight so about a point 370 watts and I'm telling you the flavor is moi not just a flavor though the vape from adjust is it's so good it's like a little warmer a little stickier lingers a little bit longer the citadel might be the first RDA I've paid over $40.00 for if you think it's worth it I think it's worth it for sure if you want good flavor but I know some people that don't like the Hat elite they don't like with the flavor they get off the hata ly so it's definitely a subjective thing you know thanks so much for all you do you helped tremendously how do you dispose of old bad nick properly I don't really know I don't think you're supposed to just pour down the drain though right let's let's let's google it how do you dispose of nicotine liquid you probably have to go something like you probably have to go somewhere I'm assuming I don't really know this is what nude nicotine says over on reddit the correct way I'll show you you where is it the correct way pour onto wood chips and put it in the biohazard hazmat waste container at your nearest waste pickup center usually a three dollar fee for drop-off by us but well worth the peace of mind and helping protecting the environment we're talking about 20 to 100 liters of pure here though for a real small amount of 100 milligram military base flush it with water down the sink for a good three to five minutes don't quote me on this EPA would have my head as a business owner for quoting me on this so you pretty much just pour it down the drain pour it down the drain and flush it it's probably because it's just such a small amount it probably just gets filtered out but if yeah if you have like a pure concentrate it looks like you're gonna have to go to some waste center and have them dispose of it pour onto woodchips that's interesting what do they burn it I guess it's easier for them to burn you what coil and why did you prefer in that RDA alien coil 70 watts hey man I bought the Trinity glass for the wasp and it makes it so much better I heard the same thing I need to try to pick one up I heard the same thing I think a lot of Ultem from cheaper Chinese products is just actually colored PE T or P om yeah I don't know I noticed it pretty heavily on the wasp and like I said I noticed it a lot on that oh Jenny and especially when the one that sits in an ultimate ink I notice it it just mutes the flavor and it has a weird thing but with the wasp is just completely muted it's not bad but it's not it's not like saturated you know does it leak I actually haven't had the Citadel leak on me but once yet what I do notice though I will say this there's one downside to the actual performance of it sometimes when I over drip on it it doesn't leak but when I go to drag from the top the juice will kind of just like slurp into my mouth and that's only when I like kind of drip too much or I'd alright drip and then I think I didn't drip and then I drip again so it's happened a few times the only thing that's not very good but it's probably just a product of how close that coil is to your mouth so I'd much rather the flavor than deal and deal with that than anything else you know it's not that big of an issue for me how is the synodos airflow compared to the headily it's a little bit more restricted when you have the chamber reducer on when the chamber reducers off it's exactly the same and I don't know if you noticed it but I also pinched my I don't go fully wide-open on it all the time I kind of pinch it down just a little bit I think it just adds a extra little boost you know I'm soon looking to get my candy mix some more chew how do you bring a chewy note to a mix would you take a quick look at my recipe vape days on orange lime candy please well all right we can take a look at it if I can't find it as soon as I search it but I'm not gonna look at it but if it pops up first and I'll look at it for ya there it is all right let's take a look you got dragonfruit 1% TPA or kept Italian lemon Sicily jelly candy what I would do you got a lot going on for sure you could probably start to consolidate some of these some of these probably aren't necessarily needed but you could also just add I would maybe drop the dragon fruit to 1/2 a percent and then add 1/2 a percent of vanilla swirl and that'll add just a little bit of shooing this and may be instead of cap Italian lemon sicily maybe use Capella's lemon lime to me that has sort of more of a candy flavor to it I use cap lemon lime and a lot of my candies it's like my secret and secret weapon with candies so you can try that out I should help you wait and I know you don't like the Oh addy but I love my Oh a DX is the end this new cyclone Maud yeah the Citadel I've been considering getting the Nixon heart s RDA it looks like looks great as much as you four as well everything got my hands on some cornbread pudding the flavor is okay but kills a kind and a coil so quickly in my opinion it's not worth it talking about um that juice from we talked about that juice country clouds cornbread pudding it does wreck your coil brochure there's a lot of there's a lot of sweetener in it that's why it's so [ __ ] sweet but man I haven't actually had that in a while I should go back and pick some up it is it is getting to that cornbread time guys Falls here I had to put my sweater on today it was chilly I love it let's let the fish get nick buzz hey when try the vicious and a radius the vicious ant radius well I like it what is it it looks pretty interesting the radius V to the problem efficacy and stuff is that oh I don't know where to get it I guess the website huh this looks interesting there's only one image of it I'm gonna have to look at reviews of it what's your opinion on liquid barn lava cake constructs delicious one of the better chocolate bakeries out there for sure what's the best party a for flavoring on a budget honestly you probably get like a had a leak loan and I know Mac probably hates when I say that but I don't think he makes the hata lis anymore if you can't afford the Citadel maybe try to go for like I had a leak loan or some sword I mean the wasp if if the ultimen bother you you could try the wasp mouse is super cheap anything that looks like a Hadley would pretty much be good a good RDA on flavor like just side you could probably get a plume ville a plume veil or a plume veil clone or like one of those older tugboat style RDAs those are really good on flavor I don't know where my plume veil is but I should rebuild it because that it is really good on flavors the the best flavor RDA until I mean that was what 2014 look for a plume veil version 1.5 or something version 21.5 one of those I promise you you can find a plume built for like in a bargain bin somewhere for super cheap you know what I mean and you're gonna get awesome [ __ ] flavor from it and it's super customizable it has side air flow it has top air flow it's awesome don't use the top air flow close the top air flow down use a side air flow any advice on granola base sorry if this has been mentioned in a video before I'm getting into granolas I'm not sure where to start I like to use like a fake cookie and acetyl pyridine the problem with granola is that I haven't felt like I haven't found like a really good use for granola yet so I had it kind of depends on the recipe like if I'm gonna do a strawberry parfait then I might use TFA cheesecake with graham crust a little epic cookie a touch of AP and that will give you a nice little granola but a kinda like that wouldn't really work in like other situations it's a little bit recipe specific what video editing software do you use I use a final cut and Premiere Pro and After Effects I use all of them pretty much but Final Cut is the one I use mostly it's so fast that's why what's the matter if it's an ick salt and normal liquid Nick is there any reason to not use the Nick salts in a recipe and that's really personal preference there's the only difference is that you can use Nick salts at a higher Nick and and it won't feel like a higher Nick it'll feel a little bit lower let's order some flavors real quick I need to make an order I need to pick some more yogurt up let's hope both city has it come on baby come on boss yeah yeah I'm picking up a 30 mil for sure boom add that to the cart yes thank you normally what I do is I'll add in all of the ingredients that I know I need that I've run out of the yogurt is definitely one of them widows oh I do need cheesecake with graham crust I'm also out of that so anyone who needs to make an order on flavorings feel free to copy what I'm doing when I order a 30 mil that means I really use that flavoring a lot you know what I mean if I order just a 15 mil and I don't use it much or I'm going to test it out we could take a look at well we'll start a TFA real quick I don't we won't do all of them we'll just do a few we'll just do a few right I don't really need too much TFA I don't think pretty much have all of this I'm pretty much low on I'm pretty much low on flavor West and that's pretty much it I don't think I need anything here any new ones let's see if there's an if there's like a new list you and see let's sort by newest items Victorine love is new carrot cake well that's new right I don't have that one I don't think I only have to carry it I don't have carrot cake let's add that to the list no out of ten now I don't need much of it let me meringue tart interesting what's this cappuccino that's not new flipper was eggnog I don't have that we could pick some of that up a little bit a little tester actually might have it I don't know though uh wonderfully pers carrot cake I have that pineapple candy you yang Mayberry yang may wonder flavors coming through let's try their pumpkin candy I don't know if I have any of these yang Mei huh snake fruits interesting oh you guys want to know a little secret I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this but I heard through the grapevine okay I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this but you guys know me I get rumors I can't keep them I can't keep them to myself so don't tell anyone all right don't tell anyone I don't know if I'm supposed to even say this what cappella is releasing you know how they have super sweet and how it's basically the industry-standard sweetener they're gonna be releasing super sour and I'm getting some I'm getting someone the low real soon so I don't know when it's gonna be released there's no promo materials on it there's nothing that they've never said anything about it but they're releasing a super sour along with a couple other flavors and I should be getting those as well but I'm really interested in that super sour so don't tell anyone keep it on the low I'll let you guys know I'll I'll be the first one to let you know how it is okay if capella hears this just say that you heard it from someone else you didn't hear from me super set come on and from what I hear but again these are rumors this is just around the grapevine but from what I hear is is a game changer it's a game changer they're really excited about it it's a game changer that's all I know they said that's what I heard it's a game changer super sour think about it if they are the ones do it if anyone is to do sour the right way in my opinion it's going to be a tella I've been on a capella train for the last year you big I think there they are my number one now like number one flavor and company I think capella is at the top I do in terms of in terms of the flavorings that they produce the variety that they produce the the care that they take into the flavors plus the way that they treat the vaping industry the way that they listen to feedback the way that they have the v2s they have the reduce flash so it's easier for companies to ship their flavors the way that they produce flavorings you know they listen oh we want this so give us this flavor and they'll produce it good I think capella is now my number one for sure actually for sure they're my number one plate other than my own flavors which are the best my own one shots which are the best and everyone should go buy them right now Easy Express a liquid barn and chefs labors if you're in the UK but other than those capella is at the top of the list shout out to capella if you're looking to sponsor the channel feel free to hit me up we can get that we can just send over the check how much capella I [ __ ] sell come on man come on capella hit me up hit me up actually I do need these as well I don't even have these flavors crunchy frosted cookie tropical we'll add this one on the list we have all these new flavor arts ones what else we got here so some questions talking about a piece talking about a piece sometimes when I use AP it gets really nasty after about two weeks like when you over saturate an image there a percentage you stick to when using ap I usually just use a half a percent I'm usually never really need to go over more than that but I like the way that like when you say when you oversaturated image cuz I know what you mean that's good so nice little comparison there or analogy is that the right word the granola I've been stuck on specifically bunola banana granola from primitive vapor company worth looking into it's solid I'll check it out I'll check it out I haven't really seen many good granola so I mix up mustard milk on all I can taste the strawberry does it need to steep yes you're gonna taste a lot of strawberry though it's not the most balanced of recipes I know I can get it I know I I know I can get it anymore but what's a good combo to sub for anywhere a waffle I don't know maybe TFA waffle I don't really know I don't really know anywhere a waffle is it necessary to use weights for calibration of scales yes all right moving on to a couple more I'm gonna start mixing we don't need that we already have that they got the whole stevia line so I think we're just gonna hit up the flavor West because I need a bunch of flavor West really and I already have all of this stuff unless you guys think oh I did I am missing some hang soon so we can go there what am i out of with hangs I think I'm out of there blueberry which they don't sell here [Music] you oh this is what I need the Australian chocolate here a lot of good things about it add that to the list Australian chocolatey let's see here french vanilla ice cream I'm out of this is see this is something I'm gonna buy a 30ml of because it's oh no they're out god dammit you [ __ ] just just give me three 10 mils in what are you doing or just get one then muffin anything else to think we're good here hang seng strawberry I mean if it's anything like they're blueberry let's get it do I have some actually this list of a check now add it to the cart [ __ ] back to the list let's go you those I'm gonna take a half like there vanilla they probably got a good vanilla right all right and now we go to flavor west if you're wondering why I'm doing this because you know how many people ask me what flavor is I should buy on a daily basis it's absurd you do I have flavor west blue raspberry is it worth buying I don't even remember ever using that I have all these buttercream butterscotch Ripple Kenny watermelon but I'm being but a boom the hardest concentrate to get down under yes seriously I hear it's good though you how have you not tried Australian chocolate yet I really did I don't know I just haven't tried it I haven't seen it in many recipes that have needed me to mix it and now does the one I haven't tried I've tried literally every other chocolate on the planet other than that one you you just anything Australian is weird what makes is what what are Australians doing to their chocolate like I understand like Belgian chocolate right they're known for their chocolates but is Australia known for their chocolates don't answer that Pippa think we're actually pretty good on a lot of teeth blue-raspberry sucks friction likes it oh one second oh there we go sorry back back to the lisp to the Lisp back to the list gummy candy yeah I don't need that oh I need this alright I'm gonna ask you guys a question I'm always answering your [ __ ] questions I'm gonna ask you guys a question what is the best regular fruit punch flavoring out there just straight-up red tropical fruit punch what's the who makes the best straight-up tropical fruit punch does anyone is anyone now you I need to know this straight up red Hawaiian fruit punch shams in let's see let's just search fruit punch actually and we're not just going to search it we're gonna go to ECX as well sometimes they say they have different flavors and we're not gonna go here either we're going to go to one one on one one one one flavor one goddamn [ __ ] let's search the fruit punch watermelon pie who meets watermelon pie you you what we got it looks like tropical fruit punch bicolor sucks you there's see there's like nothing there's like nothing how is fruit punching out on the list it seems to be easy what on one's got to have something they always have those kind of flavors get out of here you're chat oh let's go one on one I'm counting on you there we go fruit punch flavored liquid concentrate boom look at this website what are you doing well ad that's a 350 for that for a 10 mil come huh I said I guess I still got to get there graham cracker all right any any other flavors I think we're good on flavors to most six guys start mixing I gotta get we got to get to it I think Hawaiian Punch of eight will give me a heartburn I can actually see what you mean by that I like Beetlejuice it's tropical but not exactly ready I have the Beetlejuice yeah it's not it's not like a red fruit punch and I guess I'm just gonna have to resort to making my own but I wanted something that I can kind of build off of it just doesn't seem like that might be possible there's nothing out there really that really does that you know let's see the natural line ecto cooler yeah I think we're good I think we've got all the flavors we need any other weird ones that I might have to recommend to you guys is this new I mean they can't use that logo I don't know if that's a I don't know if that's a Bull City thing or if that's a flavor worst thing they cannot use that logo well let's see if flavor Wes actually uses that logo I would assume so they have the logo on the logo you you a shower yeah they do use it as their a logo you it's on their website swiss cherry maybe I'll just go on there so you and see what they got click there's a couple more new ones tequila they also sell CBD isolate that's a tit goji berry alright hello Karen get the [ __ ] off my screen hold on one fruit punch but it's not red in my opinion it's a bit funky but not in a good way damn I'm gonna have to make my own man Oh what gives fruit punch that really I don't I can't recall like that red flavor but it's like a strawberry but it's also like what like a lemon like a strawberry infused lemon lime you know I didn't mean like it's an interesting read tart flavor I'm gonna have to make my own that would be a pretty popular recipe maybe I'll make that a layer you guys can have a [ __ ] fruit punch flavor for once Greeks like watermelon pie it has a sesame seed crust and honey did what the [ __ ] is watermelon pie though I no offense to you Greeks but if you're eating watermelon pie that sounds crazy to me is it actual watermelon it is Oh what the [ __ ] is no that looks terrible it looks terrible I don't understood I don't understand it what like what is that that's not pi don't try to tell me that's a PI that is so odd I know like sesame seeds on watermelon probably is because I I know people who put salt on their watermelon and it kind of adds a flavor a little bit I don't do that crazy [ __ ] but I've seen people like this is not okay what is that watermelon is delicious do they bake the watermelon this looks disgusting this literally looks like you know when you like leave watermelon out too much and then it kind of has that sour flavor you know like you leave watermelon in the refrigerator for too long and then you go to eat it and it's [ __ ] gross it's like sour and mushy that's what that reminds me of how do you make how do you make this I'm soaking I'm so concerned flower for cup smashed watermelon seeds removed oh my god this these pop-ups are getting out of control some honey some white sugar some salt ground cinnamon sesame seeds you place the flour in a dry skillet over medium heat cook for a few minutes stirring occasionally until golden set aside to cool preheat the oven to 350 in a large bowl stir together the watermelon flour honey sugar salt and cinnamon grease a 9 to 10 inch pie plate and sprinkle half of the sesame seeds over the bottom pour the watermelon feeling over the seeds the feeling should be about 1 inch too thick sprinkle the remaining seeds over the top bake for 4 to 50 minutes in a preheated oven or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean allow to cool completely before slicing refrigerate leftovers so you're basically baking why would you just put just flour in a pan this is so odd now I'm a little concerned for you Greeks concern for you Greeks have you heard of this I mix 2% yellow cake flavor west and 5% vanilla custard gives me acid reflux see even on a period up to six months steep it's weird yeah don't wait that then if it's given you any sort of ailments not worth vaping all right all right let's get to mix let's get mixing let's get mixing before we do this have to make sure that I do this so we're gonna make something vanilla like I I think vanilla is a really versatile profile you can vape it any sort of during any season any whether but now is always good so we're gonna vape we're gonna do some sort of vanilla I think a vanilla buttercream frosting actually sounds like an interesting thing to make so in terms of like a profile you maybe we will try that vanilla buttercream frosting and I want to use flavor west buttercream I really want to see if that is that secret ingredient and Duchess that has been eluding us so add that as a first ingredient what percentage that's the question River was Razzleberry and island dream what is Island dream what is that what does that consist of like butter creams pretty strong so we'll go 1% I know vanilla is so good when I was so good oh by the way I went to federal donuts if you guys ever come to Philadelphia make sure you stop at federal donuts I don't know if there any if they have hetero Donuts anywhere else but they do make the best [ __ ] doughnut on the planet the glaze just those simple glaze is the best then they have like a cinnamon sugar 1 and then cookies and cream 1 all I recommend all three of those if they have the lavender one get the lavender one they do a pumpkin one they do a maple butter one that I also recommend those are like seasonal one so get those as well but if you if you're just going in there you want to [ __ ] bang and donut plain glazed it's the best and then get yourself a coffee and you're having a good ol time let's get the buttercream I'm thinking we start off with that let's try to keep capella added equation it's so easy to just hit get the custard get the butter you know I mean license let's try to keep the capella out of the equation let's try to stick to other ingredients that we have and try to really do something weird with a vanilla not weird but just something that's not a custard or pudding so we're gonna do a frost I think we go with meringue for like that frosting like feel we'll do a meringue marshmallow thing you know I'm saying I'm gonna use TFA's meringue you we'll do that at one point five and we'll also throw some marshmallow CFA marshmallow at a half a percent I don't want I don't want to probably don't even need it I might have to take that Apple well we'll keep it in there for now babe trains description is accurate an island inspired cocktail with hints of tropical fruits cream rum and coconut yeah well that's not like a fruit punch I'm thinking like just straight-up red sweet sugary fruit punch razzle berry might be a good step though the razzle berry might be a good step I saw some interview I watched some of your interview videos and it looks like you tower over people how tall are you no I mean I'm only six foot I'm 6 foot I'm average I'm an average height I'm not like zesty or Rick Rick is like six I think Rick is 7 3 all of you know I don't even know how much she weighs but he's a gigantic man and then I think Loco I don't know who's bigger him or loco loco is like 73 he used to be pretty big but then he kind of lost a lot of weight he's doing keto so I don't know how much she weighs either but he must be like 300 just like he's a [ __ ] giant as well so I'm not like those guys I'm just six foot six six foot I'm just six foot six foot is not average I don't know six foot seems pretty average to me but there's a lot I see a lot of people taller than me that's for sure in Italy though I was among the taller men in it in Italy which was kind of weird like you can walk down the street and I can see everyone's head and I'm only six foot you you you you you you you you you are you gonna make this recipe public I make all live mixing recipes public every time it's public I'm actually doing this one on eliquid recipes.com so if you follow me you should get an update and y'all reck law on either on ela grass be calm I'm thinking maybe we go with a little maple what do you guys think touch a maple in there with the vanilla let's try it like I'm thinking like a 0.25 look I don't know I don't want much of it in there just a touch I think that should kind of add to the oddness the oddness of flavor what if we added some pumpkin pie by hangsen I did a little survey who thinks the best pumpkin flavor is overwhelmingly its hanging since pumpkin pie cuz it's not a pumpkin spice it's like a mushy pumpkin flavor I was thinking maybe it'll add like an interesting accent to it but now I will leave that out what about hazelnut some hazelnut in the vanilla it always seems to work well the problem is I have the meringue in there if I add the hazelnut it's gonna taste like cereal milk and I don't want it tastes like cereal milk but maybe with the buttercream and that with me the Benigno the buttercream and the maple maybe it won't so maybe we'll try that out maybe we'll do flavor west french vanilla you you you you 2% maybe so we got meringue maple bar buttercream french vanilla marshmallow I'm thinking maybe a butterscotch you you Thank You Carl Carl just saved me from getting wrapped up do I go flavor art butterscotch or do I go butterscotch rips go butterscotch ripple on this one why not this is turning into an interest an interesting flavor here well we did 2% on that as well we might have to turn the buttercreamed down or not Schweich I wanna see what it does and then I'm gonna add some super sweet at 2/5 is 0.25 I don't want too much the vanilla you don't need much of it all right this is what I got so far is it gonna taste like vanilla buttercream frosting doesn't look like it that might be a bad name it's not not exactly what I was thinking about when I was putting these flavorings together you you all right you why do I have so much buttercream this is um this is an unnecessary size of buttercream the smell good you you by the way I was making a strawberry cream the other day for myself and I was using Capella's sweet strawberry and capella super-sweet in it and I ended up pouring 6% of super-sweet into my recipe and I didn't notice it and I vape that nine moves [ __ ] threw up so make sure you're reading your labels carefully you you you you you you you you you you you you interesting smell is interesting you you all right what's the difference between holy vanilla and shisha vanilla there's a big pretty big difference to me shishun vanilla is uh I would say more of like a vanilla spice then like a vanilla cream or vanilla extract me it's like a vanilla spice almost like more of like a vanilla Madagascar vanilla but there's even more of like a floral note to it that I get from it it's pretty good though and holy vanilla to me it's pretty similar to vanilla custard but it's maybe thinners not much eggy properties to it it seems to work better with like um like a bakery sense or like it with with heavier flavors they're just two different vanillas it's kind of hard to explain it in words smells like the Duchess you hear that Carl just for you Carl Carl's been asking for the Duchess for the last three years now let's do it little drip holy [ __ ] it's better than the Duchess holy Cavis is so good this is really good you Carl mix this up right now Carl you're welcome here's your Duchess this is better than delicious it's not as rich or it's not as it's not as what's the word that I'm looking for not rich I don't know I think it's almost a little too sweet I might have to nix the supersuit put something else in there this is really good is it a vanilla buttercream frosting no this is more of like a maple vanilla this is like a maple vanilla this is like a maple vanilla that's why I'm gonna rename it right now before I forget let's rename it maple vanilla now this is also a public recipe it is now up on ELR I will also be up on all the flavors as well I have to carry it over there what's cool about you know r2 is that I'll show you in a minute as soon as it this is a problem we all are that I've been having recently after I click Save recipe it just freezes does this happen to anyone else it just freezes I don't know if it's saved or not every single time though it has been saved but it just it just stays on this screen forever I don't know what's going on it's been every single time so what I'll do is I'll click out of it what you can't I just have to close the window completely and then just hope to god it's saved yeah to public I hope so I can't really show you because I have some stuff on here that I then only I should be able that only I should see but essentially I could I can put it in my live mixing folder so all the live mixing recipes for ELR they go in this folder but you can't see the folders though which is unfortunate I think that would be cool too if Lars could implement that and then all the flavours just needs to implement folders completely is there's no folders on all the flavors at all I will love that Scott come on let's get the let's get the folders going or some sort of categorical organization if you want buttercream frosting just babe babe trains vanilla buttercream frosting done don't have that anything I do some of the day trading stuff I have who does smoke pretty good does smell like buttercream frosting hmm yeah that's a lot more like buttercream frosting that's a lot more like buttercream frosting this is not American prize is a maple vanilla it's really sweet so if you are someone vaping in a citadel a heavily and empty on maybe drop the sweetness off completely like no super sweet at all I probably won't need it I think the sweetness is coming from the buttercream I'm not exactly sure but other than that or maybe it's coming from the maple butter that might be where this sweetness is coming from but the flavors itself it tastes like like a vanilla almost like a vanilla sponge cake like kind of like soaked lightly with maple syrup that's kind of what it tastes like and if you are a fan of the Duchess mix this up you won't be disappointed I promise you and this is definitely the key to the Duchess this is it butter cream flavor wise butter cream it's in Duchess a hundred percent I will go to the grave with that oh no it's spilling everywhere that's what's leaking [ __ ] you how is the lingering room odor with the maple I don't know I can't really smell it I can't really smell it I can't smell the room I'm gonna have to walk out and walk back in I'll let you know I'm happy with this recipe I don't think we need any tweaks I don't think we need any tweaks I'm surprised you're getting that much maple out of the maple bar that low well with the buttercream in there and the butterscotch I think that's what's all leading to that maple flavor it's not just the maple bar the maple bar just seems to be sweetening it it really doesn't seem to be introducing much flavor it's kind of adding more of a darker deeper richer maple flavor to it but just lightly I really want you guys to mix it up I think this is pretty [ __ ] good how does flavor West buttercream compared to Cabela's it's completely different it's more of like a it's more of like a maple cream than a buttercream like it's got like a maple syrup and note to it it's a sweeter flavor but we're cappellas is more of just like more of just like a plain buttercream and then the french vanilla they're pretty similar I would say the flavor west french vanilla is a bit more flavorful it shouldn't say flavorful it's a bit more lighter on that spice note we're cappellas french vanilla it's got like a prominent spice note to it you know especially their version too which I normally use theirs also seems to be no like off notes with flavor west where capella is I sometimes get like that plastic off note that comes with with their french vanilla and their custard sometimes it seems a little bit brighter as well it's just a brighter french vanilla it's more akin to French vanilla you would find in like a coffee creamer that's kind of what flavor west french vanilla reminds me up it's like french vanilla coffee creamer where it's sweet it's lighter it's it's more it just has that flavor to it if you taste it on the back of your hand you'll notice what I'm talking about is it a shake and vape or steeper I mean I'm shaking in vaping man and it's pretty damn good after sleep it'll probably be a little bit richer that's for sure this is really good tastes like Dutchess but with a little bit more of vanilla know what I call this recipe 100% finished no I think I can make it a little bit better and it reminds me a lot of like our true tres leches cake so I do want to mess around with that in the future kind of play off of this profile into a real tres leches cake with texture with like a nice body to it I'm happy with it okay we're done mixing I was easy fun good times good times everyone good times okay any last questions any questions comments anything anything in the news that we should be talking about anything that's a newsworthy any new vape drama any vape drama going on it's my favorite UFC 229 aftermath your thoughts well we I don't know if you guys know this but John Jones and hold the mirror are fighting so that's been confirmed same with Derrick Lewis and DC which is dumb DC is gonna destroy Derrick Lewis since I'm gonna be close it's not gonna be close mark my words if you're betting put all of your money on DC if Derrick Lewis does somehow win like he did last night or not last night but you have C to a 29 then I will eat my words but that was just a lucky throw dude honestly it wasn't him fighting well and it's not his heart it's just that the other guy got too cocky and he should have just backed away for the last 20 seconds instead of trying to go toe-to-toe with Derek Alou like what do you think that's his own fault it knocked out like that and then we saw Connor get his ass handed to him by khabib it wasn't even close he's not even on the same level as khabib in terms of any grappling any wrestling Conor right now he should have went home after that whole thing and just our training wrestling if he ever expects to beat khabib just the promise is that when he shoots on you and he tries to take you down as soon as he grabs your leg one of your legs you're going down he's gonna sit on top of you and he's gonna elbow your face into the mat so you cannot let you cannot let him get you like that ever and it's so hard to do that because he's so good at it so he got his ass whooped it wasn't close at all Lawson or 1 0 rounds could be won every single round but then the aftermath happened so it could be jumps out of the ring and charges after his trainer and his boys kind of jumped Conor but now I understand like the whole kind of degradation of the sport which I I agree that does bring the sport down but that happened when Connor was given those free passes as soon as he threw that dolly through the truck he should have been suspended he should that they should have suspended him they should have represented you know I mean he should have gotten some type of punishment they cannot treat him they cannot treat him above anyone else and I understand he's a superstar he's the moneymaker but this is what happens you end up degra degrading your sport further and further so then khabib you know it's this is not a game to him this is his life is his his honor his honor right it's not it's not fun and games for him it's just a different mindset so he takes everything super personal and you know I'm not justifying him jumping out of the ring and doing all that stuff but to say it is to say anything about how anyone deserved anything or to say that he should be kicked out it's just it's just a mess and honestly it's all Dana's fault it's Dana White's fault you either have to put us out to that [ __ ] immediately or your sport becomes the WWE and it becomes a [ __ ] crazy circus which I don't mind I think it's fun I thought it was awesome that it ended that way I mean it couldn't have been a better ending ending that fight with khabib starting a riot is just awesome that was so great it was so entertaining I don't really care for the honor of the UFC cuz I'm not a UFC fighter I'm not a guy who makes money off of the UFC so it doesn't matter to me a lot of the consumers feel the same way it's just entertaining we like to see that stuff but if you don't want your sports would be like then it well then you have to bank Aviva and you have to bank honor for the dolly incident you know what I mean now the shit-talking is one thing let them [ __ ] talker you should talk all they want talk about his father talk about his his religion talk about his family and stuff like that but it was the DA the specific dolly incident where he [ __ ] he had to put he put Michael chesa into surgery he had to get surgery for that you know Rose was a champion and she had to deal with that before a fight it's crazy it's crazy he should have been suspended and now you have John Jones coming back which is the whole thing in itself and you can argue that he was degrading the support as well so we've kind of entered this new realm of like WWE UFC crossover which I like I did I do like it I like the whole theatrics of it I like the drama it's like WWE except they're actually fighting you know what I mean and I think that's really cool it's just up to the administration and it's up to the fighters if they want to fight in something like that personally UFC should go that route even harder and then have Bellator as like the Honorable you know UFC sort of MMA sort of a leak you know where you go in there and it's all you know suits and ties and you go and you do business and everyone has a happy happy time or shakes hands at the end let Bellator be that and UFC be the crazy WWE moneymaker that it is because there's no turning back you can't turn back now you know you can't turn back now if you do all your views are gonna be going down they're gonna get a taste of that money all the talk all the promotion there's no going back from that so I don't know that was my that was my input on it I loved it I loved it I'm a huge Conner fan I'm a huge Conner fan I think he is sooo so entertaining to watch and he's just a fun fighter to watch like he stands up and he brawls with you he has that old Irish you know he stands sideways and he has that old Irish sorta yeah let me get him Moss let me get him and I love that fighting style where it could be a little bit more boring but I mean he's just ruthless so he was he was when he was had him in the rear naked choke it looked like he was gonna rip his [ __ ] head off like it was hard in there I'm surprised to even let go and as soon as he let go he jumps up over the [ __ ] that was just crazy it was awesome I'm excited for DC DC black beast but I mean I think DC is just gonna destroy him easily and then I am excited to see John Jones come back in the ring after so long I think John Jones is gonna come back and he's going to dominate the whole weight class again I really do I think he's that good I think he's that good so yeah they should go back to Gracie jiu-jitsu well the problem with that is it seems like that sort of fighting doesn't work anymore it doesn't work when you're going against guys like khabib who are just so much stronger you know those Gracie jiu-jitsu guys a lot of them are really flexible like I guess Tony Ferguson would be the best sort of it's not really Gracie jiu-jitsu he's tenth planet but he does have like that jujitsu ground level and he's strong as well as you saw in that Pettis fight I thought that was the best fight of the night him verse Pettis was awesome but when you have someone that is so physically strong like DC and like khabib that sort of American wrestling style ground-and-pound style just seems to be the most effective right now and then you if you're a jujitsu guy and you're going in someone that's just that much physically stronger than you it's a lot harder to kind of put them in those bonds and put them in those holds but it is sort of still it's still an effective martial art against you know stand-up guys and guys who don't train that they don't know what to do they don't know how to counter things because once you start wrapping them up there their instinct is to kind of get out of it but that leads them into an even tighter hold you know and then you're setting them Jiu Jitsu is fun to watch when you know what to look for and then I just think American wrestling right now that American wrestling ground-and-pound with DC and khabib that's just the most effective way to win and it seems to as you know the cards show it seems to be that's what it is and what other news has happened recently I think that's it Kol duty came out I've been playing Call of Duty all day today I'm probably gonna go home play some more oh and then Kanye hey meaning with Trump now you talk a little bit I know a lot of you guys are our Trump supporters and you're getting triggered already by me even just mentioning the the name Trump but when I was I watched that Kanye meeting Trump thing and I just couldn't help but feel like Kanye is just SiC like he's mental like he really has something wrong with in his brain he was just incoherent like I I didn't understand what he was trying to get at with Trump it just felt like words were coming to his brain and he had to say them immediately like the whole like dude the eye plane five like look we gotta get you the we got to get you the best plane you know check out this the eye plane one and a jump is like oh cool I guess we're gonna get rid of Air Force it just was making no sense it was incoherent I didn't understand what he was saying and then you had all these reporters around him and you're just watching like this mentally disturbed guy try to speak to a president who is just very he's just an attention [ __ ] you know you love him or hate him Trump is at attention [ __ ] so you just it's just this really weird sort of visual with the President of the United States like we've never really seen anything like that you know if like I wouldn't mind if it was Kanye but he was like coherent and like making sense and making actual points but he wasn't he was just rambling he was just like very erratic and he was standing up and sitting down and supposedly after he left he went to an Apple store in DC jumped up on the table at the Apple Store and started telling everyone about China and then supposedly when he was leaving he said he was going to Africa like this is a sick man you know and I preached a lot about mental mental health awareness this guy is mentally disturbed that he needs someone to really evaluate his mental health cuz it doesn't seem like all his marbles are there not him being woke I can guarantee you that he's just he's just an incoherent at times are just crazy it's craziness we're having a crazy a crazy time crazy time so I don't I'm kind of over politics it's just the politics in this country are just they just don't make any sense there's nothing to do with policy anymore which is which is kind of sad like the whole Cavanaugh thing and I watched grim green talk about Cavanaugh and to me the whole cabin all thing is just like none of it had anything to do with policy it was all fear mongering it was all just this disgusting display of character assassinations and talking about his yearbook and like you know what I mean like this guy's gonna be in a Supreme Court justice and instead of talking about his policy and trying to really understand the policy in the way that he thinks they're talking about his high school yearbook and he's trying to defend himself and I felt bad for both parties both forward and Kavanagh because I'm just like what what have we become this should been up this should be a private conversation between the bem to and it should be a private conversation maybe between their lawyers as well whatever that is but when you're sitting in front of Congress and you're singing in front of the the the whole Commission you know everyone there plus reporters and you have all the media there and you're talking about is yearbook what what time is this what what what timeline have we entered it was insane to see that it was really a spectacle but we'll never see anything like it again you can guarantee I can guarantee you this type of politics you'll never see again it's just it's just craziness you'll never see it again so enjoy it while it lasts cause it's not gonna be fun anymore it's gonna be all because remember before politics politics before it was today it was very boring and it was very depressing and that's how politics are gonna be in the future so this time where it's exciting and it might be scary it might be scary but there are there is an excitement there and there is a level of just action that we've never seen before and once Trump's gone and once this administration's gone I guarantee you is gonna go back to boring depressing just hateful sort of politics or everything's very secretive and things dark and you don't know [ __ ] you know we're gonna enter that time right after this admission so enjoy this administration while I see you love them or hate them enjoy a while less cuz it's not gonna last you know I'm saying anyways let's get out of here it's getting late my desktop just turned it's telling me his night time I will see you guys Monday make sure you head over to ecig expresso you pick up my new layers if you like my one shots and you want an easier ways to mix recipes head over to e cig express flavor concentrates one-shot concentrates DIY boom right there or you can head all right here to the n ya'll rec law layer line there's only one right now we're releasing the candy enhancer very soon Elizabeth's custards here traditional vanilla custard it's super easy to mix with you just pour your favorite fruits your favorite nuts your favorite candies your favorite chocolates bakeries you just top it off boom super easy check that out helps out the channel helps me out helps me continue doing what I do and yeah I love you all keep mixing much love I'll see you guys Monday peace have a good weekend", "viQJRdA7oqA": "it's complicated holy crap weed is complicated you have to know a tiny little bit about where I'm coming from on this because I think that the old saying where you stand on an issue often depends on where you sit at night is very applicable here so just just a tiny little bit about me and then we are going to do we're at 7:20 what time we start 7:15 yeah anyway we're gonna drink from a fire hose in a second let's and I am raising three kids in the weed capital of the world and that 7:30 great and and that influences and affects the way that I see things it does a couple of years ago maybe a year and a half ago I was at a cannabis summit in Northern California and I said I was from the weed capital of America and a guy who owned a big grow operation in the back said yeah give us a minute and so can maybe maybe Humboldt will catch up again to Colorado but for now yeah we kind of got you guys beat we went first and so we have a pretty unique perspective on this and I've been trying to pay really close attention something else that I know impacts us is my own recovery I got sober not not too far from here actually in June 15th of 1996 and by the grace of God haven't found it necessary to put anything into my body that changes my mood since then and what I found in working with young folks in recovery is this really has changed the conversation you know we got this secret society right and we like we help each other out sponsor people who do that kind of thing and there's always been this idea of marijuana maintenance you know like that no get sober from that but I'm not really gonna get sober from all of that what we come to learn a little bit maybe later on in our recovery is it's not so much about cutting one particular thing out of our life is it is what what have we been avoiding the conversation about and what we have we've been avoiding actually sitting down and getting into and this has made it a little more difficult for me with some of those guys because it's so prolific and there's such an accepted idea out there but like there's this it's just weed thing and another little crusade against that lately because I've seen people getting heat being like not as good an addict when they go into treatment for this and people vote it's just weed well you've met eleven out of the eleven diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder I'd say you got this thing pretty good but it's changed the way we work in in the beginning of things that was just a non-profit I was involved in for a long time and that's reversed 2012 to 2017 2007 to 2012 and I was at the University Colorado Hospital for five years when we went recreational so I was inside of the chemical dependency treatment program there when Colorado voted and then when we actually opened up retail stores so kind of had a front row seat at a big safety net facility in urban Denver which was a really neat perspective during that time I wrote a book and I wrote that book with apps like no small amount of assistance from dad he reviewed every chapter he's broke to master's degrees and and covered everything basically when I didn't even couldn't spell something close enough for spellcheck to get it dad dad would figure it out for me it's a maybe you should say the sentence this way so you don't sound like a you know ten year old I wrote a book and then I gave a TED talk in 2017 last year about this that's now a million and a half people have seen it and so that one's getting kind of cool I spend all my time consulting since I left the hospital inside of treatment for labor I work for a big labor union helping them vet appropriate treatment programs but the majority of my temps time is spent in athletic circles so professional and collegiate athletics both helping them develop policies that are a little bit more geared towards helping people who have substance use disorder mental health issues a little less punitive maybe but also performance issues around this drug in and other drugs and then a couple of states I spend time working with a couple of states and now helping Canada to hopefully do this smarter than Colorado did listen it's complicated so let's start the conversation about it being complicated with with this slide I sit on the board of directors for something called Sam smart approaches to marijuana and when Sam started in 2017 it had nothing to do with being the anti group Sam is totally the anti group now they're the ones who fund the no campaigns they're the ones who are on the ground saying no but when Sam started it wasn't about that when Kevin Sabet and Patrick Kennedy called and said this is what we're thinking about doing I loved it because I loved these four pillars that they stood for so listen I'm not the politicking guy there's plenty of politicking guys who were involved in Sam and they're doing great work I'm happy for him but I still sit on the board because I believe in these things and these things start to illustrate how complicated it is so let's run through them real quickly Sam exists to inform public policy with the science of today's marijuana if we were talking about marijuana from years past for as lovely as it is to be in eastern Pennsylvania in the middle of a blizzard I wouldn't be here right now I would be back home with my family I don't have an interest in having a conversation about pardon me the historical makeup of the plant function of the plant the ridiculousness of a lot of the laws that governed the way that we interact with this plant from back in the 30s I don't have an interest in talking about marijuana and from years past because that's irrelevant in my mind to today's conversation understanding the science of today's marijuana is something all buddy people miss it even when I sit down with clinicians who are on the front line in Colorado a lot of them have missed it because it's one that's changing so rapidly and then two there's so much hype around it that unless you've figured out a way to cut through the nonsense and to try and be it is truly objective as you can is learning about it's very difficult conversation to get Sam also exists to discuss reducing unintended consequences of marijuana policy there's just some really terrible policy out there people who get in trouble for something silly that they did and then it dramatically affects their lives negatively for the rest of their life I'm not for that and as a matter of fact a lot of the work that I do inside of the athletic world hopefully is reducing that there's still some places who need to get a little bit more hip to the time so I don't like taxes and stuff Sam exists to prevent the establishment of big marijuana so like we didn't do it we need to change that from from prevent the establishment have to hold the feet to the fire of fairly conservatively we taxed the sale in North America we tax the sale of about nine point eight billion dollars worth of weed last year and 2017 will break twelve billion this year in all likelihood like this a lot a lot a lot of weed okay it's it's almost three times what we taxed in the sale of milk wheat right three point eight we are consuming a ton of weed in this country and if we miss the economic drivers behind it I think we missed some of the crucial part of this conversation if we think and may and I'm sure it still exists in lots of places around the country in Pennsylvania because you the the industry here is so young and it's in its fledgling stages but for us in Colorado this idea of somebody being like all sharks I just own that little dispensary out there on the you know tegrity farms they think wait watch the south art there they're really good integrity farms thing going it's ridiculous doesn't exist anymore you've had the the Monsanto's and the Walmart's come in and take over the cute little mom-and-pop and the people who really cared about this thing and we're a part of their communities come on man that's what we do in this country big money takes over passion all the time and and that is what has happened and so if we are willing to have a little bit more honest look at that part of it I think we could have a much better conversation about this thing because to think that big marijuana is not a thing is to allow a profiteering industry to have free rein and to not have the same kind of checks and balances that we hold over everything else Sam also exists to promote research on medical marijuana and to produce pharmacy attainable medications thank God the feds finally got out of the way and let ever dialects give it FDA approval and now we've got that that we have now three medications that are cannabis base that are good there's you ready for this like you you Hawks who came in here ready for somebody to bash marijuana until the Sun came up and the give me some bad news like there's medicine in the plant like like period we know for sure for sure there's an anticonvulsant is anti-inflammatory topical anti-inflammatories a whole lot better than ingested because ibuprofen looks better than that there's there's some really amazing stuff for people with MS particularly late stage MS and relaxing muscles and ticks and a couple other things are promising there is medicine inside of this plant and we would have been a whole lot better off from the beginning to have admitted that and had honest conversations about it now with that said you don't smoke medicine ever period stop end of story like never ever ever in the history of ever has it been like you know we should do we should dry that [ __ ] out light that [ __ ] up and inhale that [ __ ] that's the best way to get it into our bodies no no no that's not what you do you isolate the components of particularly pharmacy attainable pieces and you do it in a regulated manner not somebody telling you this one fixes that this one fixes that this is good for that you have to be very very careful with medicine by popular vote so we know that there's medicine here but we also know that there's a whole lot of hyperbole here and a whole lot of profiteering here and we need to be careful with what we call medicine so look there's a little bit of the it's complicated part this is this part is not complicated the true scientific stuff that we're going to say tonight is not complicated real science is you're ready for this it's simple you'll win this on Jeopardy if you ever get asked the question this is real science is journal published peer-reviewed the thing that your nephew read on HuffPost or that like came up from BuzzFeed or the like no no in surveys aren't science and polls aren't science and something that somebody says they they did a big long scientific study on but hasn't been reviewed by peers or published in a journal doesn't count so every single thing inside of this tonight is journal published and peer review there's a full list of citations at the end appropriate for continuing medical education and Kim will make sure anybody wants it I draw heavily on these we have some wonderful demographic data that's come from the Colorado Health Institute lately I'm gonna have to start to fly a little bit to get through this so excuse me for skipping through some of these things got to do something we have to start this I have to figure out a new way to start this thing because I asked everybody to do something that's almost impossible at the beginning I'm gonna ask you to do something that is nearly impossible I'm gonna ask you to step away from what your construct of marijuana is so if I feel free to play along if you want if you don't find it but when I close my eyes and if somebody says weed the thing that I think of first off was the cover of that Dre album from when he was still a rapper the chronic I'm pretty sure you threw it out when you heard me listening I knew you through the cherry pie single out with - I see the cypress hill shirt that I owned they said legalize it on the bottom with the leaf on the front of it I see a green leafy plant I see Cheech and Chong after the whole false advertising thing with a joint this big as fast times at ridgemont high and that's not just that one seen the whole thing I see fast times and I see dazed and confused and I see Friday I see a plant and and what we're talking about today man if you I hope you can read this and said this is the new school cannabis it's not what you've smoked in the 70s let me say something crazy and something that actually frustrates people sometime and then give me the next ten minutes to prove it to you here's a there's a big blanket statement and you got to give me a couple minutes to prove it unless you have purchased and consumed a commercial product THC product in last three years or so you don't know what you're talking about you are operating under a construct of what this is that is so antiquated that it is irrelevant and for us to believe that we know what we're talking about because we you know listen to Joe Walsh and got a little bit high or Cypress Hill or dr. Dre or that and we haven't consumed something that's come about in the last three years what we're doing a disservice to the people who were trying to have that conversation with I believe because we're not talking about the cannabis of the 70s we're talking about THC so there's two hundred some chemicals inside of the plant before you light it on fire five hundred and seven after you light on fire there's two of them that really really really really really matter CBD why are we so concerned with CBD anybody medicinal it's where the medicine is it's elated and and synthesized oh boy especially synthesized like it's where the medicine is that's something else kind of cool we'll talk about in a minute well and how about tea tea why are we concerned with that it is the like capital letters underlined psychoactive component inside of cannabis THC is the part of the plant that is the drug all right eh sees what gets you high you got a plant with a drug inside of it and that's the drunk and and and I love the honesty of this particular dispensary they chased me out of the parking lot is always taking the picture because it's not like nature's healing whatever there's just like look we sell THC it's what we do what do you want we got it we got it what you want THC we got th so you remember that movie thank you for smoking there's a point in it where the protagonist having a conversation with an executive from a cigarette company and and the executive says man we don't sell cigarettes we sell nicotine delivery systems shift shift shift I'm not talking about a plant I'm talking about THC and THC delivery systems in fact I think it's incredibly important that we begin to change our vernacular around it a little bit you'll see me move away from saying things like cannabis now unless I'm actually talking about the plan and I'll be referring to it to the market as THC for the rest of time because we did what we did in Colorado was built a dedicated THC market there's absolutely CBD available and absolutely lower percentages but there ain't a ton of money in it it's like people last wells tumble can't you get CBD well of course you can get CBD there's real medicine there and there but um like you can totally buy decaf at Starbucks I don't know the last time I did it but like sure it's out there but the market is for the THC so understand this we're gonna go a tiny bit 201 for you guys tonight because you were so gracious to come out again here's th see here's CBD this is the kind of data set we dream about beautiful perfect perfect data set same place same people same everything 1960 2011 this teaches us several things the first thing that it teaches us is that the understanding that we have of what the historical plant cannabis hemp etc with the our understanding of that plan historically was spot-on as we started to measure it and that is that you ready oh so if one at one or two of us have heard that marijuana is natural right what is natural what what naturally occurs inside of this plane as less than a half of a percent of THC very 0.2 to 0.5 unless you were like Indonesia or somewhere subtropical or they had like some ball or but you know 150 years ago maybe you get 2% you had some for real stuff which maybe maybe that and what we see is we start to measure 1960s we're barely touching this is done in the uniform way we're barely touching it and finally in the 80s these guys started to listen to the to the people at normal who were screaming at him outside of the door saying it's there's medicine as medicine and I actually started to test for CBD so what we see here over the course of these 50 years is we go from the the naturally-occurring amount of THC inside of this product to where we were in 2011 when the federal government shut this whole program down but the important thing we see and this is what most people miss and this is what you guys will know now you can come back to a great retort to most arguments that it's not so much about the THC so we actually get really bent out of shape about high THC products it's not so much about how high the THC is as it is about the Delta between the two because what naturally occurs inside of cannabis is not just that less than half of a percent THC it is a one to one ratio of THC to CBD it's god's little gift this is cool this is something that makes me like get excited about and super respectful of this plant especially historical context of this place when the 50 cent to learn decided traditional Chinese medicine we just found it more tombs in Asia we found it in tombs in Africa like mankind is interacted with cannabis forever and in the plant that God gave us is a one-to-one ratio of THC the CBD and the reason why that matters is a CBD neutralizes the psychoactive component that is tac at a one-to-one ratio you can I get high I don't care if you got 10% and 10% you'll feel a little weird from smoke inhalation right interesting cool but what do we do man we can't enough we can't mess up and in this country there's there's nothing that we won't figure out a way to screw up we got more THC kept the CBD about the same why why did we increase the THC yeah because we wanted to get hot like if you guys oh when you graduated college to habit if y'all would have chilled out a little bit back then maybe we wouldn't have gone to hydroponic inverted hydroponic cloning and a sexualized plan indoor grows super accelerated growth patterns and then the real thing was as we were just kind of mixing strains together to make them stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger we over the course of 50 years later we'd stronger check this out fifty years increments of two and a half fifty years two and a half six years increments of five in my home state let's put it together blue is Colorado Green is when we stop measuring nationally this is what most people know and want to talk about you think you know weed unless you have purchased and consumed the products that were sold commercially in the last three or so years your construct of cannabis is so antiquated that it is irrelevant simple because this was not doing the same stuff that this is what we see associated with this is things that you would never have imagined here yet the historic arguments persist what we want to do is talk about this substance and sell and consume that substance is not fair it's not appropriate the it listen I'm a I'm a grown-up there's a lot of grown-ups out that you can do whatever you're gonna do don't drive that's my thing if you got a fully myelinated frontal lobe don't drive I'm not gonna tell anybody how to live I'm certainly not gonna throw my agenda on everybody else's life but I will tell you that if we're making decisions on what you think this drug is from interaction back here this plant was back here about this you are not operating with a full amount of information and I see as my job to make sure people got a full amount information okay okay okay we've gone from good gardening to good chemistry good God like we got to be careful here one of the first questions that I get asked when a traveler doing anything spend you really believe that marijuana is addictive if there's absolutely like it's not a belief system I like to answer by saying I believe marijuana is addictive in the same way that I believe Wyoming lies directly north of Colorado believe that I use like anybody else in this world who's paying attention to it okay watch this what watch those of you who also prevention or treatment in here couple of you watch how far we have come in this country you guys just fill in the blank throw the word out say whatever comes to mind at the end of this addiction is a disease you cannot diagnose a disease by walking around and seeing what's on somebody's playlist what their ethnicity is what car they drove up in what kind of shirt they're wearing how many times they've watched Friday the only way you can do it is with objective diagnostic criteria there are 11 set forth in the DSM if one meets two or three you have a substance use disorder that's classified as mild four or five moderate six or more severe using those criteria given 2002 data roughly 9% of all adults adult being someone with a myelinated frontal lobe of fully developed frontal lobe which is mid-20s 26 for guys 23 or so for women someone with a fully myelinated frontal lobe of a 9% of you will become addicted to cannabis if you're exposed to it the reason why that doesn't matter even a little bit is because that's the portion of the population that's genetically predisposed to any way that if all of us woke up tomorrow on a desert island 10% of you would be doing really weird stuff with like coconut leaves and stuff with me in the corner of the island because right because we needed that dopamine spike now it gets interesting when you look at a pre myelinated brain adolescent which again under mid-2017 percent and it gets really interesting when you look at data from 2011 a variation of a hundred percent let's dissect it just a little bit if I can tell the entire world one thing it would be this that's what we were talking about a little bit yesterday that the DSM the manual that we use to give the the diagnostic information for all mental health disorders for the first time ever a year and a half ago included a diagnostic criterion for cannabis withdraw post acute withdrawal syndrome pause with accompanying icd-9 codes from cannabis physical dependence on THC sooo back here nope not so much remember hits you can get a psychological dependence you can do it yep back here true here completely and totally different and absolutely we I was part of the very first wave that watched all of this happened real-time you go from seeing this never to seeing this six seven eight hundred times a month things have changed we've dramatically changed because it's a different substance so let's talk about the why here's my home that's Starbucks that's McDonald's that's wheat you know laugh it up Pennsylvania see well you're freakin governor does here 1014 AD 376 from 2017 bring us about here because in 2017 we added 376 let's do a little econ simple simple simple self how can Colorado support this amount of retail it's very easy there is a consumer base it's very very easy we can support that growth in that amount of retail because there's a consumer growth how does that growth continue at that rate again SuperDuper simple you in crease the consumer base two ways to do it convert curry users to more frequent users capture new users no other way we have to ask ourself why does the old 80/20 rule matter in this situation the 80/20 rule that says that 80% of the booze in this country is consumed by roughly 20% of the consumers that the alcohol industry could care about my wife and her four or five margaritas a year he's the guy was drinking mad dog 20/20 at 12 years old who they really liked sorry about that again I put these people through a rough time in Colorado 84% of the THC has been consumed by 20% of the consumers who are those people no disproportionately young under 26 problem users they are problem users like anything this industry is gonna build what they got on the backs of the least fortunate those of us with a substance use disorder those of us with mental health disorders those of us who are more challenged those of us who are economically disenfranchised they will be the 20% consuming eighty four percent in Colorado you are twice as likely to consume marijuana daily if you earn under $25,000 a year than if you earn over 50 the problem users let us build the problem users I'm gonna teach you something new right now III hope those of you in prevention and treatment you already know this you want to build a problem user for THC there's three factors there's really four but we have no control over genetic susceptibility and genetic predisposition the three age of onset frequency of use and THC potency if we're growing at this rate and if we gotta build these people there's a quick tour of Colorado age of onset that's Cookie Monster on the side of a dispensary with a plate full of dope they got a cease and desist from Sesame Street that's Keef cat and Buddha finger chrome crunch these guys got these guys got a lawsuit from Hershey's this is the the open house dates that my kids brought home my daughter when she went from eighth grade to ninth grade last year my son went from sixth grade to seventh grade so they each got these in school is the boulder daily camera it's not some fringe weirdo newspaper and it's got all the open houses and like the whole a client's middle school they have a better marching cheer whatever so they went to to pick which ones they work as they were given these in school my daughter comes up 15 minutes later she goes dad check it out there's a half page full-color ad for a dispensary and page one of that called star buds and she goes first I thought it was for Starbucks but then I realize it was for weed I thought somebody ought to give that marketing guy of bonus because he did it he got that message in front of every single kid in my County and he branded it to something that they know and love anyway age of onset I'm gonna have to be a little judicious with time here age of onset poohbear davon doesn't turn me on any of you relatively responsible adults out there have you downloaded the cush moji from the iTunes Store yet that made 20% off move in special at cu-boulder who moves in May and freshmen sophomore I'm like 21 year old freshman sophomore though are there out there Spring Break 20% off with your student ID Santa Claus with a bag full of dope a back-to-school special with a half-naked chick hair there's 20% off with your student ID there's Fred Flintstone smoking a dab between two half-naked chicks frequency of use smoke weed everyday' listen man I don't care how developed your frontal lobe is don't smoke weed everyday' this leaves the physical like changes in the physical structure of your brain lots of gray matter white matter connective tissue and we're actually starting to see a lot more long-term residual stuff too don't don't don't fun to have fun but really the same thing like if somebody was getting drunk daily you really okay don't smoke weed every day unless you're these guys going twenty dispensaries then it makes sense so weekend don't forget to dabble daily I teach you about dabs in just a second we make it easier for you consumable pre-roll oh shoot will make a gas station where you can pull up get your gas pump for you and get somebody to bring your dope oh that came in the value pack to my house it's $1,000 pound who needs a pound of this weed to consume dollar joint when I show you my ski pass or bring in your ski pass and get it for eight here can I translate elevate your adventure and go as high as you can can I translate that's where you get really really high go skiing frequent frequent frequent all the time I got a buddy in Wyoming who's 13 year old daughter and wife were struck by a snowboard impaired th-the impaired snowboarder only THC his wife was in the ICU for like two months and his daughter died like skiing stone ain't funny man but look haha potency bud tenders are trained to have their most potent products that they're ready when ask for a suggestion why age of onset frequency of use and potency and here's the messaging at home that I have to contend with is I'm talking to young people and say okay listen maybe this for older folks as I've moved into more of a harm reduction mode medicine for you maybe need to be more careful whatever old man teddy bear riding the roster rock it over the flat iron to stay high Boulder it's difficult to to I want to teach you guys like like two things quick in the next 10 minutes before our questions and I'm not going to have time to get to the mental health issues what we're seeing but before I go into these two because I'm gonna go SuperDuper quick through what you're gonna 10 10 or 15 years from now we we are going to be having a conversation in which the next generation is going to say can you believe there was a time when they didn't see a link between psychosis other mental health issues in THC in the same way that my generation says to you guys sorry I keep hitting the thing in the same way my generation is like I can't believe there was a time when you guys didn't know the link between tobacco cancer unbelievable the that's a foot race between the knowledge in the industry but what's happening with it from the mental health side listen man had a two three four percent counterbalance with some THC in it we didn't have these problems that movie reefer madness was insane they made it because the government wanted to do bad things to black Hispanic and Asian people the movie was nuts today though we see true psychosis associated with this for real but the problem is cuz people freaked out before when they didn't have any business doing that now nobody's taking it as seriously as they should outside of the medical world but my dance card is full I could do three of these a week if I felt like being away from home that much and the majority of them are for physicians holy crap what do we do with all this that we're seeing how do we handle this we're talking about concentrates and edibles real quick sixteen percent in our discussion of concentrates we begin with this number because sixteen percent is the highest potency cannabis we have ever studied Lancet journal February 2015 volume 2 number three the effects of high potency cannabis on psychosis there's a new study that will get the first report from Hoffner at all looking at roughly eighty percent at a uch this year but until then mankind humankind's collective knowledge of high potency cannabis ends here 16% so when we talk about the issues associated with high potency that's what we're using as the benchmark with this number what Lancet taught us was the daily use which is five times a week it saw an increase in psychosis fivefold multiplier five weekend use which is twice a week so increase threefold and one quarter of all the psychosis in the sample group was causal like isolated for sure causally there's a whole question causation correlation you know did this start the fire was it just gas on the fire it's a really good question with marijuana because a lot of the times there's pre-existing conditions and who knows what's going on it could be a million different things but what we're starting to find said there's actual causal with this high-potency stuff so concentrate concentrate concentrate what it would what you're gonna see who's familiar what you see sometimes I think is like it's so intense for some people that they're like oh that can't be a thing so we like we rationalize we find a way to explain it we said that's not really what people are consuming in 2014 the word concentrate shows up nowhere in the annual economic report about weed in Colorado even though we were selling it 2015 once when we say there's contaminants same thing in 2016 2017 s report they say oh we taxed the sale above ground so we tax the sale of twenty seven thousand eight hundred and ninety pounds of concentrates in Colorado four point five million doses if you can't read this it's the concentrate education campaign but its dispensary says cannabis concentrates are potent start by consuming a small dose about half the size of a pinhead or less we're still twenty eight thousand pounds of that last year taxed the sale the twenty eight thousand pounds so it's probably forty percent of what we actually didn't say this is not friend use I've been on the front lines of this since 2007 in Colorado I've been in and like the formal hospital side front lines of this since before and through this is not what people are graduating to this is what they are initiating on and the idea that well they'll just consume less that's does not how tolerance for THC works you go over throw this in YouTube you know you watch people consuming five six seven eight nine grams there's a 10 gram challenge with a bunch of so that this is not friend use Colorado last year and 2017 sold more of this by dollar amount than the plant sink in for a minute in Colorado we sold more of this which I'm about to show you what it is then the plant not talking foreign juice mainstream market so here's what it is this is great crack is back crack is wack crack he'll say no to crack sound familiar well kids I'm here to tell you that not all crack is bad some crack is actually really really good we're talking about crack weed so we call it for 99.99% age where does our collective knowledge end yes the rest is anecdotal you consume these things in a vaporizer with a ceramic tip because 700 degrees or so is ideal for the rock form of them you consume it with a aromatherapy kit that you plug into the wall because it gets the high cuz it's hot quicker you consume it on a glass pipe because it's rock form you consume it in these little pocket email vaporizers I'm gonna skip the videos because of time but I'd like to encourage you all to go and watch some of these things the making of concentrates are really simple the concept is really simple it's not hash like what you're used to what you do is you take an organic material in a closed area and you force the solvent through it so you take weed shake what's turned off of the buds you force the solvent through it and then what you have at the bottom is the solvent plus THC and then you refine and you do different things to it but but that's how you make a concentrate butane was have we all started butane was really effective at stripping THC and out of it so you start with butane propane is effective Everclear is effective Coldwater is actually really effective there are now gravity is also a great way to do this compression is so again to give you an idea of the scope of this and how much it's changed recently like this is purchasable for home use out of Boulder now this isn't this isn't like for the corporate producer this is a closed-loop extraction system that I can buy in my house because check here this one's more of a compression gravity mind your own gold so the value that we're talking about here just speaks for itself again I'm not gonna I hope that some of you will put this stuff in to YouTube tonight and watch people consuming concentrates because it's it's pretty profound here oh that this one's interesting I like to show this one because because this is he's a large man he's not a small guy and he samples this inside of the store and again most of these videos are sort of showing different things associated with it doesn't manifest how you're typically used to weed manifesting it manifests differently like these concentrates when you when you hit him for the first watch this guy kill a friend today on YouTube kill a friend day but what he does is he gives dedicated marijuana users the first concentrate hit and then he films it what we are doing is trying to have relevant conversations with people and teach them how to navigate the world and the streets telling them about our experience learning how to drive in a hand-cranked Model T going 30 miles an hour down hill and they're like huh I don't understand you and we're like why don't you understand me because this is their world and that's ours because unless you consume something you purchased commercially in the last three years you're talking about something back there and they're talking about this because to them today weed looks fundamentally different to me you see that beautiful nut right there when I went down to the 203 and I bought a dub sack if I had one of these inside of it I was thrilled because that was weed to me today is butter it's wax it's shattered this is weed the technical definition every salt derivative extract of and concentrate from the cannabis plant the practical application for the people who are the young folks especially who are consuming today that's we this is weed and they believe this stuff that it's organic gluten free cage-free marijuana cuz to them that's that's weed and so is this I had to call the sponsee and ask him what this was when I saw it for the first time how about this see that's that's weed water and ice osmosis that's marijuana yeah right no oh it's not it's not no yo it is practically speaking and this you heard it here first a year from now when everybody's talking about this where you heard of here first THC a this is what it's all about these are all the specials in colorado these are front and center I go to dispensaries all the time there's a front and center in all of the dispensaries these are what the coupons are for this is what everybody's pushing THC a pure if we have more time and actually break down the chemistry of what it is here but it is can you imagine it's a distillate distillates the work you imagine the level of acumen you have to have to take a green organic material and turn it into that now it's we that's we this is marijuana today and we know it's not the narratives the narrative still exists that it's natural experts only now I'm gonna make you that person quick and the finest buds guide and westward this year we're lists all the strains and all the different places are selling them we started this came up this year with bubble hash wax shatter crystalline sauce live resin shatter for stronger and much more potent hi shadow is the way to go it's more pure due to the filtrations of the product subsequently removing many of the terpenes wax as a product using butane a liquid gas as a solvent to extract the main cannabinoids and terpenoids plants are immediately flash-frozen after being harvested sauce is a full-spectrum extract caviar is cannabis flower dipped in hash oil dried for a few hours and sprinkled or rolled in Keef distillates create one of the more pure cannabis products on the market distilling can have a noise down to the molecular level and delivering higher THC content this is it it's a molecular level separation of Delta 9 THC nothing not even a whole THC molecule the Delta 9 THC y'all no Snoop Dogg's those wait nope Willy cells week and if Willie Nelson moves you to get high I don't really give a crap what you do if Snoop Dogg moves you to get high though I actually do care because that's a different generation of some younger people snoop sells concentrates because he's smart he's a good businessman 7/10 is oil upside-down july 10th is the new day stop saying 4/20 you sound old say 7 10 and people go huh crap you know going back to nature don't forget your natural cannabis where your concentrate headquarters the narrative still exists that this is natural it is not it's not and until we have a much better idea of what these are doing to people's brains and bodies you're ready for this giant like they don't belong in the world period the only place they belong in is in the portfolio somebody's trying to get paid off of this substance they don't belong being consumed until we have a much better idea of what they're doing inside of brains and bodies however we sold more of these in Colorado than the file why money's at 80/20 look this came out in Scentsy magazine last month it's normals magazine that they published now do you even dad Brooke oh yeah all day every day look good here we get that occasionally I'd say I dabble in uh no honestly it looks like you're smoking crack oh you don't know okay do you consume any kind of mayor marijuana at all no well then you should try vaping because here's what if you don't consume now try vaping and then we're gonna move you ultimately down to concentrate consumption well yeah I do okay let's get you how do we get you down to concentrate consumption first one's on me I heard that one before vaporizers you need to know one thing no smoke no smell no mess you need to know that they come in like they this was funny CPS and Denver ran this thing and said vaping is easy to hide these kids and their nicotine vaping and they showed that picture and I was like hold up that's a pax so it's a THC specific vaporizer and anything that's even nicotine specific on YouTube in 30 seconds you can learn how to take a jewel and make it into a distillate vaporizer so they look like this they look like this that's a functional pen that you use for inhaling concentrates it's a tac specific vaporizer these are THC specific vaporizers for your belt or your shoe they have a little curve in them that's like eating dessert with your lungs this is a disposable THC specific and I love it our concentrates taking over the marijuana market these are THC specific vaporizers that was high time magazines product of the year in 2017 and there's your bubble gum flavored one so the thing you gotta understand about these things is there's no smell with them consume didn't consume now edibles and I I have gone for minutes over this is where I'm gonna end it I'll run through the edible sports we're gonna have conversation we're skipping the mental health part and I'm skipping the hopeful part about how to effectively intervene I wrote a book and she's selling them it is like she's subsidizing them like Kim ordered all of these and you can't get them on Amazon or anything for that so it's all in there but here's what you got to understand about edibles man and this different in Pennsylvania right now right now but there's so much money to be made in these it's not gonna stay different forever this is a pack of gummy bears by a company called Etta pure and in Colorado ten milligrams of THC is a legal dose now because there's science behind that most people and the medical community said well none is a safe dose if we have to we'll say five milligrams but none is the only safe dose this is what they agreed on in the committee's because we had 13 months to build all this infrastructure there's 10 gummy bears in a package 10 milligrams of the legal dose implication is simple there's a hundred milligrams of THC in each one of those gummy bears there's my rendition of this back home I've read a whole chapter on this and a chat like it's incredible when a cannabis industry association is like oh we can't possibly change the way we're producing it we'd have to repurpose machines and stuff look you'd have to oh hey there repurposing machine ok because because nobody's eating attempting going here and this these are the problems these are the acute issues that people suffer because because the way it works I'll check this out see that little candy right there that's a distillate the distillates are all making their way into edibles now because nobody eats that 1/100 of a graham cracker what happens is okay so look if I'm getting high and getting high and getting high and I start to feel a little weird what do I do I stop getting high like I put the gun down and they step away from the button I put Darkseid in and I just mellow mellow if I ingest more than ear of this gummy bear and I'm used to getting high this problem with edibles we're used to alcohol in this quick smoke hitting us hit as quick because we got to wait for 40 minutes and then we're like why am I not feeling anything maybe I got the ear without the THC in at night the rest of it you can't do anything there's nothing you do activated charcoal no inducing vomiting nope you can hydrate and you've short-term antipsychotics but that's it what the only thing you can do is ride the ride and this where people are getting into trouble in Colorado and my hats off to Pennsylvania thus far for not allowing edibles to do anything like this but but they're here it was funny when I was at the school yesterday one of the young guys I was talking with it was like everything I buy is Colorado everything's come straight from Colorado but concentrates to edibles to the plant because we're sore stick with us or state now for it so here's your lesson and this is where we're gonna end it and go to questions which some of which I hope of ask about hopefulness and effective interventions but if it can be introduced into the human body it has been commercially produced with TAC nm they have yet to find an exception and if it's being commercially produced with THC in it there's a market for it especially in places that don't have dispensaries so coffee post tattoo anointment toothpaste vaginal suppositories the staggering variety begs the question what can we infuse hot sauce ketchup barbecue sauce coffee cake up coffee candy granola bars ice cream nasal mist this is remarkable and new this is faced faster than smoking or safer than smoking faster than edibles small and discreet it's topical THC that effects you psycho actively that's wild stuff it's new brand new brand new it use anywhere anytime here's a swallowable pill again a fairly impressive feat it's got to be activated Delta nine there's a sucker with 70 milligrams in it here's tea little candies little gummies a happy pill that looks a lot like a Reese's that's for real that's not a joke that's for real you see these things going around sometimes you're like Oh somebody's messed with you know that's actually something called a pop rock and it's the kids candy with THC and it there's Tarts here's THC infused alcohol do you ever come home after a long day work and feel torn between which substance you want to use to escape reality this is the obvious that you know the highest year that everybody had this idea that we're gonna replace one with the other the highest three years of alcohol tax revenue Colorado has ever collected have been since we commercialized THC there's a eighty five milligrams of sugar and 350 milligrams put that into YouTube tonight Keef Cola there's a spoiler alert the kids drinking that no kids because that doesn't appeal to me aren't drinking a 35th of the bottle anybody keep after rap culture is THC syrup here's 99% pure THC watermelon flavored drink here is THC water Tec chai tea and juice and mints and suckers and swedish fish and candy bars and cookies and hot cocoa and caramel and the March Madness bracket candy bars liquid THC 5-hour energy caffeine plus THC THC breath spray and as the THC breast spray is something it works out for you either as a THC infused Lube and here's a THC infused suppository 70 milligrams in its seven doses so when I asked the young lady when I bought these how I was supposed to consume one-seventh she was like come on I was like do I put like a seventh into my rectum and break it off or do I like wait for an hour - and she's like come on it should be on a documentary that's coming out here the lady record it's called pot luck the lady recorded it all and she's like no come on and I was like well seriously I don't understand how 1/7 of this enters my butt and change he's like just oh this is the back of the candy bar about another day there may be health risks associated with the consumption of this product this product contains marijuana and its potency was tested within an allowable plus or minus of 15% variance here's our mental health our physical health is in here as well here's pregnancy which is a huge deal in Colorado and here's some incredibly interesting places to go look for more information I've gone over let's have our dialogue time thing you know when she went when Kim called she's a friend of a friend and when Kim called and said I know this person and I know and loved them too and she said we I was in Pennsylvania last week for the Pennsylvania DUI Association Annual Meeting and flying from Colorado to here's a lot and I wasn't too crazy about it and then she told me the format which was like discuss some of the times I wonder why the reason like I got it maybe we're in the place we're at in our country because we aren't having awkward and challenging conversations and because we're not willing to say actually I totally disagree with that I completely disagree with that I don't know you but I'm gonna share something from my heart with you like I think I think like this fixes the world when people sit down and talk in a respectful manner so like I came because of this part so enjoy and thank you [Applause]", "uLQSNK7RTcc": "like it's that thick like almost like you know like just a lot a lot of [ __ ] body to it it's heavy he's dense and he's rich one of those babes that are very satisfying this one just seems to hit every i mean it's just so full so creamy [Music] [Music] all right guys so it's [ __ ] it's christmas it is christmas most wealthy season of the year tis the season yes it is to be jolly do you have any christmas songs i don't care we don't have santa claus [Music] we have a a huge snake a big snake that's a snake like the grinch in that one thing where he was slithered around like a snake yeah true story so you just have the grinch yeah santa closes the balcony why is he giving those kids toys evil mastermind who wants toys when you guys have cold yeah so who's the good guy the snake thank you so so what does he sliver down the chimney or something they don't have chimneys oh he slithers through the sewer pops and comes up i got it to the sewer yeah yeah exactly we have sewers sewer pipes inside the house yeah you decorate you decorate your toilet yeah yeah so it's nicky can he bring him our gifts he brings you gifts though yeah that's gotta be very hard for a snake we we have to live okay the tradition is you leave a like a bowl of dead rats for the snaky guy sure so he can eat the the it's like a snack for him it's gotta be awfully hard to deliver presents [Laughter] how does he do it he's just kind of like all in him and then he just vomits them up because they expand ours is boring we just have a fat guy who uh apparently just brings a whole bunch of presents around with a reindeer and he flies through the sky actually yours sounds a lot more believable [Music] i think that's the whole episode people from argentina are be so mad at you they're like we have santa claus my whole point of asking was you said you don't have eggnog which makes a lot more sense now that i know about your tradition we don't traditionally drink eggnog i don't know why you would because yours is in the summertime well no no wait because we eat a lot of things that are more european like tyrone almond all like very caloric food that doesn't make any sense when it's summer no but we don't do eggnog okay so you okay but i know eggnog i i've tried eggnog what what do you do what do you want to do with eggnog i think we should do eggnog ice cream what egg dog ice cream have you had eggnog ice cream what do you think that adding just vanilla is going to make it an ice cream because eggnog is already eggy i think that you haven't thought this through i mean most most ice creams that are vape in vape form tastes like melted ice cream yeah and eggnog is basically a real eggy melted ice cream all right well then let's just make eggnog no no no wait wait you mean doing eggnog like from scratch no why not why couldn't we because you need nutmeg and flavor eggnog has the only usable nutmeg you want to do eggnog something with them i mean here's why i was saying if you did do like the perfect eggnog vape nobody has done a perfect one people put eggnog and [ __ ] but they don't make it like the real deal because like flavor eggnog isn't enough um there's other [ __ ] you gotta do to it to make it like an actual eggnog vape it does have an egginess to it and it does have that nutmeg kind of vibe to it right yeah so that's that's something we could work with for sure maybe we can do an eggnog from scratch using flavor eggnog but not like just for the spice i mean because i i feel that flavor eggnog is missing the combo of ram with bourbon or whatever to use it's in that part it needs rum and it needs to me it's not eggy enough and it's not thick enough because eggnog is thick and it is [ __ ] sweet and flavor eggnog isn't really like the whole package for that it's everything in the middle but it's a it's a starting point yeah i mean that nutmeg is great to make the the real eggnog do they use milk or like a heavy cream i use eggs heavy cream and then i i think it's just full cream yeah some of the recipes call for um whole milk whipping cream some call for just cream some actually put a little bit of cinnamon in it i don't know if you all want to do that or not maybe a touch but not like rich cinnamon but the main things is is egginess some type of heavy kind of milky cream vanilla nutmeg and rum right it's got to be like silky smooth i i think they use some of them use a mix between ram and something else yeah some people do bourbon but i have an idea why don't we try to make like the perfect eggnog and if we do it then we decide what we want to do i mean once we have the a really good eggnog drink would you say if you want to do a cheesecake or a cookie or whatever or ice cream i mean that's probably still on the cards right this this this is gonna have to be super super thick it's gonna have to like really coat your mouth yeah heavy heavy i think i used to do the favorite milk what about milk flav flavor art no flavor art flavor art milk okay i was thinking more like vape train they've changed what with cream oh their ice cream wouldn't be bad remember that was really eggy well guys uh i mean i i think that's pretty eggy but if we really want if we want to make this really eggy gelato vanilla bean gelato or french vanilla from capella that seems like that sh like would be about right in there but it has a lot of vanilla maybe both yeah because the the the french vanilla has that ripe vanilla that i'm looking for in an eggnog but i don't think it's very eggy it has like the the like that that thickness the weight to it right it adds volume don't we need like a more aromatic vanilla i don't think it needs to stick out too much i think the rum needs to stick out more well fevora eggnog we need flavor and eggnog yeah we didn't yeah that's that's the first thing let's try the gelato too i think those two need to be in it i think vanilla bean gelato needs to fill out flavor eggnog for the egginess why are we are we using french bonito i think it's a good choice if you think that would be the right vanilla it's got a lot of volume to it i mean it really it has that distinctive vanilla punch to it that's not just plain vanilla i know it's a little bit like on the coffee creamer side yeah but that might be what we need because i was thinking for for the cream or milk part why don't we use flavored fresh cream instead of fa milk yeah we could do that i think you could do that at that point if you have the volume especially since we're using the vanilla bean gelato so fake cream fresh and then i think we need two rums i think we need the two roms i have jamaican ram i have live ram you have the two roms okay no i have others i mean those are for me the two right those are the two rums it it's a spice drum and i think jamaican rum needs to be in there which you might be surprised you'll probably get some vanilla off of it too from the jamaican ram right yeah have you tried the rambaba by wonder flavors oh i haven't but i have heard that that wouldn't be bad i don't have it guys come on guys i don't have it i cannot do the show like this anymore ah since you got all this wonderful everything you just saw like oh i got them all now i got it i'm wealthy i'm wealthy okay so we are not going to use rambaba jamaican rum yeah it has to be jamaican rum and later on victorine yeah but only a little bit of light realm i think do we need another whipped cream or something like that or do you think that the eggnog flower eggnog is creamy enough i would try this first we got a lot of creams sweetness oh which one sweetness baby like the ladies man the ladies man like sweetness all right guys percentages okay so so we got fevora eggnog tpa vanilla bean gelato fa cream fresh fa jamaican rum uh jamaican special vape train lot rum cap french vanilla and floor sweetness right all right should we start with the eggnog though sure how high should we use it so we're gonna try to we're gonna try to build around this right right two percent the highest i've ever used is three we could try two it's the main ingredient okay i think you kind of want it at three okay let's try that all right vanilla bean gelato two i was gonna say one one okay you wanna eggy eggy eggy let's try two french vanilla probably low yeah at 0.5 yeah cream fresh one point five two i i wouldn't i wouldn't buy the medium he just did two two yeah two is okay both but it'll be gelato on cream fresh i get like a spice when i go too high that actually might be good in this being that it's got the the rum in it speaking of rum it's making rum two to this and i like what light ram it like one but light ram is light yeah i don't know how boozy you want this some people can really taste it and i think it's gonna stick out a lot in a cream recipe like 1 1.5 let's go one and then if we need to we can bump it up some okay achieve you're gonna love this [ __ ] recipe me yes because we have sweetness to go and i don't know do we do we want to go 0.5 or or more i mean you men you're gonna do whatever you want look at him nervously twitching his nose we're watching a stroke happen those meds are really helping a lot not here yeah i haven't sleep in a week but yeah but my ocd is in check 0.5 what you said it's really sweet yeah i know i was going to say 0.5 but then it's like no i don't know wait a minute maybe we want to go up on this we want to make this really sweet let's do 1.5 or maybe we should just do 1.25 why not i'm going to make 13 mils [Laughter] okay one let's go 0.5 yeah jamaican rum is a little sweet are we already done with this recipe this this can't be this can't be a one offer no this is going to be awful it could be terrible [Applause] i feel like this is a little spicy yes with that jamaican rum a little too much i think the rum is perfect though i would like to be a little bit more [ __ ] really i want it to be more creamy i feel like i'm getting plenty of booze in it yeah me too i i feel like i need like a thick like ice cream flavor yes there's there's an egginess in there but the spice is so much that i think it's covering that kind of eggy note up it needs it's not it's thick but it needs to be even thicker yeah like more weight and more silky when you drink eggnog it's like drinking yogurt maybe pudding but this is really good i like this i like the flavor of it yeah it just needs that the weight i love a french vanilla here it's the right vanita for this yeah yeah it's a prominent vanilla like it's it it tastes like a like if we can get that cream part right it takes it tastes like a um why do i want to say luxury like a boutique or like a special like like the brand of eggnog yeah okay uh which which cream should we use for this something thick like a custard stop stop reading my mind or an ice cream a custard is gonna be thicker than an ice cream for sure like i'm thinking like liquid barn ice cream or something else i don't want more bonita well you're gonna get vanilla no matter what we add because the premium's not very vanilla that probably would be it i also feel like this could be sweeter okay let's let's try premium how much like one percent we can start out with one percent it's going to be more eggy for sure you're gonna be more eggy oh this is so much better good yeah this is way better it tone down the spice yeah in all honesty you probably go down with the eggnog but i don't think you need to this kind of taste to me like you did add like a little bit more like nutmeg and so in almost like cinnamon on top [Music] but i didn't get that before it's more eggy it's delicious what do you think about the sweetness level i think it's better now i need more really i think so yeah this is so much better it toned down all the spicy notes and it just boosted up all those eggy notes i'm gonna add some sweetness some sweetness i just did how much sweetness are you using one percent now yeah i added one percent oh you're at 1.5 yep i really like this with one uh one and a half sweet it seems like it would be too much sweet sweetener in it but it's not i don't think not for this kind of recipe it's like if you were to if you were to try to add sweetener to like a normal recipe like say we had something else in here it would just that top note would be just sickly sweet and the whole balance would be off but i think working with just creams and like you know spices and like pretty much that's pretty much what we have it seems to balance it out and it's the right sweetness sweetener it's the rice winner i'm really surprised by this recipe this is this is a lot better than i thought it's going to be because other other eggnog top recipes i've tried i don't know they just they're just lacking something this one just seems to hit every i mean it's just so full so creamy and smooth but yet spicy we used three of the things i really wanted to use as a supporter sporting note are we done i think this is done i really like these guys for me this has all the notes that i expect in an eggnog it's got it's very creamy it's very heavy it's full it's eggy it's got just enough spice i get just enough um kind of that rum taste in there but it's not overpowering it's not very uh alcoholic but you can tell it's there it's just i think it's perfect it's laid in there perfect like that rum and the the custard in it just thickens it up even more yeah it's it's like silky but like like how i imagine like eggnog before you thin it out like it's that thick like almost like you know like just a lot a lot of [ __ ] body to it it's very christmassy i i think maybe if you wanted to you go down with the eggnog the spice level but it's eggnog you got you gotta have them spicy you gotta you gotta kick up them spices yeah and if you don't if you don't like it uh with the sweetness level at one and a half you can always go down on it but for this kind of recipe i think it's kind of needed i get the the eggy part the custard the vanilla the cream the spices and it's very silky smooth it's heavy he's dense and he's rich one of those vapes that are very satisfying it's also like linear but like linear enough like you still get like different accent notes but like it feels like one thing which is you know not something you would normally do but for this type of recipe you want that you want it to be it's not just enough not eggnog with something yeah a signal yeah it's just eggnog all right guys thank you so much for watching this holiday episode of developer we made eggnog it's gotta do eggnog it's obvious uh we hope that you guys all mix this up and we will not see you on thursday to talk about it but we hope you guys all

__ ] idea but oh my god this filter makes me look hey the eyes it looks good anyway this they make them in different colors I always thought they were only in green I even bought a red one there was a red one", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more

"Kbz0j3vE3TE": "good afternoon and welcome to my youtube channel today i'm going to be sharing with you all how to do a apple slice pops okay so let's get started but before we get started please like and subscribe to my channel and leave a comment if you would like also so today what we're gonna do is fall season fall is in the air and so you know you can't really have fall without a candy apple or a chocolate covered apple or caramel apple so today i'm gonna do a chocolate covered apple with caramel and also with white chocolate but we're gonna make them um you know fall like so what we're going to do is i'm going to show you different things that we have we have our nut toppers caramel and then i i did the green apples um they just to me they taste good with the caramel but you can use a red apple fiji whatever um and then i have some just different decorations so this can be like the halloween theme um and then this right here is like your thanksgiving theme colors um and then this is the chocolate that i use just some chocolate from the store um it's pretty smooth the almond bark chocolate so okay so let's get started so what we're going to do is you want to get an apple and um you want to clean it off and then you you can take the stem out or you can leave it in it's going to fall off anyways but you want to cut the apple and so what i typically do is i get the apple and i'll cut it closest to the core as i can on one side and so like that okay and if you have a little that stays on just cut it off okay and then so this can be one whole um apple as far as a slice the apple slice and then what you'll do is you'll come back close to the core and you can leave the core in there it really doesn't matter but i just try to take it off of me this way okay so then this part i'll probably just like throw away and then from this one right here you can use that as one or you can make it two um [Music] these apples are not as big so depending on how big your apple is okay so i probably should have kept this as one but try to do this too and so as you can see i have some that i've already done and you typically get about three of them out of it if it's a smaller apple and so from there then what you want to do is you want to take some sticks and this you can use decorative sticks here's a another brand that you can get from joann's or michaels and these are you know as you can see the you can use them for the big ones but you can also use them for the small so you can take one of these and um i'll do both do this one okay so you take the stick and you want to find the part that's the thickest so that you can just stick it in there so like so see here you go this one came out a little but it's okay because the chocolate is going to cover it typically try to get more in the middle but that these are a little bit thinner than i wanted them to be so there you go there you go like that and then this one it's actually kind of thin so i'm not even gonna try to do it but we do have already three done okay and see apples they start to um uh what do you call this they start to brown a little so you want to make sure that you use them if you're not gonna you know you want to do a white you know right whenever you're about to use them or you can put some kind of uh um i think lime or lemon something you know that will actually preserve it a little but i just typically don't cut them until i'm ready to use them so then here's some chocolate melted chocolate and i like to put it in a cup um and it's easy to dip so you're gonna just take your apple and like so you're gonna just dip it in there and then you sit this here and you kind of just tap it okay and then whatever size you want to sit it on you just sit it on that side so i'll sit it on this side and let it cool okay and let me get a spoon to your chocolate will start okay now let's get this one take it tip and this is something that will be really fun to do with the kids and i like the apple slices because a lot of times you just don't want to eat a whole caramel apple or chocolate apple you just really want half of it so i thought this was good for um kids and adults sometimes you just don't want the whole apple and they're cute so so you're gonna keep doing this and like i said i had some already and y'all this this is very easy to do it doesn't take a lot of time you just cut your apples melt your chocolate and you have your toppings and you're ready to go so while we're dipping these i'm also going to um add some white chocolate drizzle to them just like i did the um the caramel so you want to you can put this in a bag like this and you can go and you just put it straight in the microwave so i've got a little chocolate on that one and guys if you want to use the nuts this is a good time to put the nuts on there um set it right here you get some of your nuts and these are just nuts uh nut toppings and you just put them on there like that okay and then we have one more to dip i'll see okay then you just kind of get the excess chocolate off of there alrighty okay so from there what we're gonna do is we'll let these cool and i already have some that i actually already did so then we'll go ahead and we'll go from there let me go warm up this chocolate and we'll get started and when you warm up your chocolate it only needs to be in there for about 30 seconds and i'm gonna put them in one of these bags like this and if you want to add like different layers of colors you can also pour some of this chocolate into one of these bags so i'll do that also and you don't need a whole lot a lot a little goes a long way when you're just doing a drizzle okay like so and then we'll cut a hole let me go get the white chocolate okay so now you have your white chocolate and you have your brown chocolate okay and what we're gonna do is we're gonna get the ones that i already have cooled so you'll let these sit you can put them in the refrigerator if you want but as you can see they're already kind of since the apples are a little cool they're already kind of set um setting in but i'm gonna move these out of the way i should have put these on the pan just move these out the weight okay and we're going to work on these i have stuff everywhere okay so we're gonna go ahead and work on these these have been cooling for a little while okay okay so these are already cool and as you can see they're already cool so i had already put some caramel now i want this caramel up in the microwave and as you can see it kind of hardened again and i can warm it again um the caramel it uh it gets very sticky so you want to be careful and these are actually just these candies right here that i just individually unwrapped and melted it down nothing spectacular so from here what you want to do is we're going to do some drizzles and um we'll do chocolate we'll do white and then we'll add our sprinkles to make it look you know festive so we have a halloween look and i say this is kind of like a thanksgiving fall look so i just want to have those ready because once i start i want to be able to go ahead and do my sprinkles so you can pick whatever you want to do we can do um just the white we'll test it out we can do white chocolate and you just take some okay and then you get your sprinkles i'll do and you just kind of sprinkle them on here and i'll just place some of these acorns on there like that okay that one then on this one i'll do white also show you and then i'll do this is the candy corn look and then just get some of the candy corns and put them on there white white candy corn right there okay so you have that look and then also since we have some caramel on this one right here i think it'll be neat to add a little white and chocolate just a little white and then on this one i'll add some white when you're working with chocolate you have to kind of as you can see it's trying to harden up on me again okay this one is too let me go ahead and use this that's the one thing about when you're working with chocolate you have um it tries to harden up on you okay this one i'm gonna do over here some chocolate i think that'll look really good you know this one some chocolate this one as you can see the chocolate is hardening it up on me okay so now you have your festive and this one can just be caramel this camera with some white or nuts and then if you want to you can add whatever you want to do to this one it's really up to you how you want to make it look maybe i'll do a little this just a little so it don't take out all the white so now we have okay and see guys it's that easy just some uh nice looking apple slices very easy and this is a great idea um for uh to give away as a gift also you can put it in a saran bag um and it'll be a cute little kif it's like almost like you do your little cake pops or whatever so with these being apple sliced pops or whatever um you have you can put them in a little saran bag and put a ribbon on them and make them look cute but guys this is a quick video just wanted to give you a different option instead of doing a whole you know everybody know how to do a caramel apple i just wanted to show you something different so and i think these are so cute and festive so here are the all right well thanks and like and subscribe to my channel and thanks for

analytic here here we go it's very soft Cheers not very good that [ __ ] is drier than a Popeyes biscuit with no water my god it's really good you can't even taste um and he sort of like marijuana taste or like flour like anything weird it just tastes like solid brownie so that's one thing I really like about my edibles if I do eat them and when I do eat them is that they are just straight food like you know the candies that you get they just you can taste and it's just not a good taste it's a good smell but mm-hmm we saved that for another sense you know the nostril signs the mouth sense doesn't need to be there now it's just like eating a brownie from Cosmo I mean the only thing that I hate if you guys want to make these better I'd like that chocolate glaze on the top you know what I mean like the fudge glaze do that I should so wrap it doesn't even have that tha in it I'm [ __ ] dropping it everywhere guys I don't know if it was that blinker wet but last bite guy stirs mmm

am going to be changing my channel because i feel like i'm not giving you enough content ah pretty much i am still going to be doing my gaming videos and achievements and so on but because i can't keep on the games and you know keep up with those tvs i'm always wracking my brain what treatment do i figure i'm going to expand and do unboxing and reviews now for the bad news i did this video already and my program messed up and i lost it also i've already did my up box and then i was planning but it didn't work out so this one is not going to be as good as the original because i know what's in there and i've tried it already so we're gonna still redo this because i want to bring this content to you so my unboxing is this going to be an unboxing video as you saw will be different because it is a nature box now you probably have heard naturebox from other YouTube channels like Lamarr Wilson or black nerd comedy hopefully I'll League leave a link to their channels below because I enjoyed watching them and you might do now I don't know them but I hopefully one day we'll at least get a meat will meet them because they are very funny guys and they do great work now I let's check this out now I've already opened this so i'm going to show you what I got first of all it comes with this it's a piece of paper says spring has sprung time for snacking fun nope robotic power mix apparently it's a new thing maybe yeah new eats um apparently there is a way of doing certain things ah no big deal it's nothing just great talks about out what you could buy um but yeah I will also be leaving a link to nature box on down below but you could also go to Lorimar Wilson's a page and es mi boxing of nature box stuff and he also has a length that you can go to get a pretty good sampler pack and that's what I did to get mine actually so this is actually what it shows let me quickly because I don't want to see my address but that's the front of the box you can see it says naturebox it has little Sun on there and as a recycling symbol on the back it says this box is made from recycled materials we love saving it to collect cards or magazines how will you reuse your nature box so that words reuse your box if you can so now I got five things are all pretty good well start with so far my favorite add it because as of two minutes ago when I try this video for it is the big island pineapple now all and as nutritional facts on the back I will leave that in description below so you can check that out now normal entry ripping this open but like I said it didn't work out that way so we're going to do this all over again now the only thing I so far don't like about the big pineapple is that it's so gooey not gooey really but i would say sticky ah man seems like trying to get this to unstick from the other ones now that's not completely a bad thing because it means it's fresh now here's what that looks like that's a little chewy but you've got a hunk of that pine nut flavor now if you love pineapple you're gonna love this means oh my god this thing has literally so much pint of flavor it's delicious I could eat these all day and just you know I'm already looking this as under 20 calories and fat free now next we're going to go with the sea salt pop-pop's now these are I break tries and like I said now if you could tell you know how you buy popcorn at the storm the bags pre-made that's kind of like what this is subjects held here hmm I mean let's say you wanna sit home watching a movie need a bag of popcorn here you go tip this is healthier yeah it's actually good sea salt or blue not sure but X yes it me is actually sea salt so it's not that Jim really generic sup this sea salt and it tastes really really good but adds about nine grams of fat but honestly if you want to watch a movie and have popcorn there you go tastes really good that's for sure all right next one I'm gonna say those two for last we got the honey dijon pretzels now honestly these are pretty good if you like I let's say you know when you get onion rings you get that honey dijon mustard to put in their taste exactly the same thing here's what they look like they're not actually like a pretzel their of our pretzel stick I mean little it's like you go to restaurant get that honey mustard day out you're under rings it's just like that time I would suggest if you want to you could either eat it like this or maybe get a salad put them on there like four times it's pretty good last two we got our sweet blueberry almonds now i want to tell you i'm not a fan of blueberries at all i've tried eating blueberry muffins and so on not a fan for all you that are that's pretty cool now I'll tell you one thing here's what they look like r is where I can eat them usually gets a good blueberry powder yeah but which i'm not a fan of but honestly it's not too bad that the omen really does give us a good contrast a good play report so if I want to I can eat this first blueberry thing that I actually can kind of dive into last but not least now these are kind of trouble to go so I'm going to frys to break one up but we got strawberry Greek yogurt pretzels pressured pretzels coated with strawberry flavored Greek yogurt like it didn't say that right the first time anyway let's open these up see how they're kind of clumped together because they're kind of fresh now here's what they look like now you get that crunch try out the back that's a good thing now they're not as branches like if you dip them in Rachel Greek yogurt but I'll say one thing they're still very moist and I know there's a lot of people who don't like that word Robbie's reasons but honestly it still has that good texture and flavor and I mean you could eat these all day these things are delicious oh boy now these are nutritionists approves that's a good thing for you know and run my arm ready I will do my best EV all the nutritional facts and if you want I could add the ingredients to to description below check that out now I have one more boxing which would spend so much better if I could have showed you the my original video but I got this at hot topic it is a ninja turtles 1980s blind box now you got all the good characters you got bebop Rocksteady praying in his suit foot soldiers and shredder followed by you got Donatello Leonardo Raphael master splinter Michelangelo now the ones I wanted was rappy L which are two and twenty which has a lot um then you have was a bebop and Rocksteady bulk 24 22 and 20 um you have praying two-and-twenty um shredder is one in ten no 1 20 best splinter is one in 20 and those the ones i really want but in the end we got one of the turtles that's for sure we got done at ten oh here's what you got now I have to say is face looks pretty awesome I mean you got set it's all painted on or like molding in or some like that um now the everything else like this whole body from the neck down is painted now the head that adds an actual like you know bandana style like actually extruded out painted face now the back of the shell that one is actually detailed you could actually it's like put your fingernail in the grooves that's pretty good the articulation is his head turns and his arms go up and down that is it now in the blind bag you do get his weapon let me get it out of there you get a little bo staff that you could put in his hand and snaps right in the only bad part is that all you can do is up and down but it's a blind bag box it's not meant to be a full figure for what it does not bad but I wish you would like have a tan just slightly tilted so it could be like you know like that but that's not too bad but um anyway I just want to say thank you for watching um I planning on doing more

yesterday's video was probably the healthiest thing that I've reviewed so far this month this is one of the least healthy that I that I will review this month and that is Tootsie you know tootsie roll caramel apple pumps aka caramel apple flavored lollipops obviously lollipop have no nutritional value whatsoever but here are the nutritional facts for you and the ingredients not many ingredients which is usually a good thing to be honest you're gonna have something unhealthy you probably want that ingredients list to be as short as possible anyway I got one out and here we I didn't open it I didn't take the wrapper off but the wrapper is already coming off as it is there it is I don't know how well you can see that kind of looks like crap but we'll see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] you know now nope that that's not real caramel that is fake caramel right there that's that's the fake or cheap caramel no I don't recommend this product at all I didn't even get to the the Apple part I don't want to know no I don't I don't like it this is not something that I'm going to finish no I'm sorry about that I am NOT finishing that new I mean probably still slightly better than the KitKat but no I still no no do I recommend this new Tootsie you did bad no heck no no if that tasted like your actual tootsie rolls and sure I would have definitely recommended this product so I did wind up finishing it I felt the need to have to explain it actually is good I'm pretty sure that those first few initial tastes were the taste of the plastic it was in because after getting that first layer off but still tasting the caramel the caramel actually tasted really good and the green apple actually tasted really good so I am pretty sure that that really bad taste that I did not like at the start of this video was the plastic that seeped into the product it's at it see if you can fix that then you have a good product right now that initial taste was horrible pretty sure was the plastic now see you guys but", "oC5OeNHDMCk": "[Music] I'm Michelle and welcome to the Kraft kitchens if you like caramel apples during Halloween I have two great treats for your little ghosts and goblins ultimate caramel apples and caramel apple nachos so to start let's make the caramel apples so I have 5 really nice-looking apples here and I'm going to add to the center wooden pop sticks so just remove the stem and insert the Pops stick inside just push it right down now the trick to remember is that you have to really wash your apples really well you want to remove any wax that might be left on the Apple and then you want to make sure that they're really dry because caramel won't stick to a wet apple melting craft caramels is really easy so I'm going to give you a couple of quick tricks first to open a caramels squeeze them pinch them really hard in the center and then the wrapping will open right up the other option you can do is you can put them on a tray pop them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and the wrapping will come off the other one is get your kids to do it so now what you're going to do is take the 1 package and put it into a microwavable bowl and I'm going to add to it 2 tablespoons of water it'll pop this in the microwave and cook it on high power for 3 minutes I'll take it out after one and a half minutes stir it put it back in finish the time and then when I take it back out I'll stir it again to make sure the caramels are completely melted you can also do this on top of the stove in a saucepan over low heat and make sure you continuously stir to make sure the caramels are melting perfectly now for the fun part dipping the apples so I have my melted caramels here my apples I'm going to insert the Apple into the warm caramel moving it around like so making sure that the Apple is evenly covered and then you pull it out doesn't that look great now I take a little a knife or spatula and you just wipe the excess off in the bottom and I'm going to place this on top of a baking sheet that I've lined with wax paper or parchment that I've really well buttered and that's the key you have to remember to butter the wax paper because that will prevent your apples from sticking to the paper as they set now this is a great time to that you can decorate the caramel apples if you wish you can top them with some chopped peanuts or with some baker's semi-sweet or white chocolate melted drizzle the chocolate on or even some crushed Oreos now we're going to make our caramel apple nachos so what I've done ahead of time is melted 18 Kraft caramels in two teaspoons of water and i microwave them on high for one and a half minutes and I took it out every 30 seconds and I stirred the caramels to make sure that they were melting nicely so that's all done I've also sliced two apples and I've arranged them nicely on this plate and just overlapping you can do it in a circle as well if you want so I'm going to top the apples with the melted caramels just drizzle back and forth all over just like you would your regular nachos and then for the topping I'm going to top with one cup jet puff miniature marshmallows and just price them all around - crushed Oreo cookies and a quarter cup chopped dry roasted peanuts and there you have it these caramel apple trees are so easy and they're fun to make at your next Halloween party you're going to be a hit for more great recipes and videos visit us at craft canada.com [Music] you", "HxdusLakrAM": "Hey guys, it's Ro. I got so many requests to make some DIY apple treats, so that is exactly what we're going to be doing today. The recipes that we're making today are easy mode and they'll use three different kinds of delicious apples. You got your Honeycrisp, you got your Gala, and you got your Fuji. Some of you may not know this, but I am originally from Washington and Washington is known for its apples. We got tons of orchards. I even had an apple tree in my backyard growing up. The first treat that we're going to be making are individual apple crisps, which are very similar to a crumble. They are so good and perfect for summer. The things you'll need to make these apple crisp will be 4 large Gala apples, 1 cup of packed light brown sugar, 1 cup of old-fashioned oats, 1/2 a cup of unsalted cold butter, 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, and an additional 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour (we're going to be using these measurements at different times), 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. First thing to make an apple crisp: using a peeler, peel all of your apples and chop them up. Just be careful, don't get your fingers. Once your apples are peeled, cut them into tiny cubes. Cut on the side of the core, turn the core towards you, and cut around it. Remove the core, then cut the apple pieces into strips, then cubes. Once you have your apples chopped, add the first measurement 1/4 cup of flour to your chopped apples. Now, in a medium bowl, mix together your dry ingredients. Old-fashioned oats, flour, brown sugar, salt,  \u266bsalty, salty \u266b nutmeg, and cinnamon. Give it a light mix, I'm using a spatula. Once mixed together, add your butter. Now, using an electric hand mixer, mix in your butter, until the mixture is crumbly--usually takes a minute or two. All of our ingredients are ready. Now, it's time to assemble our apple crisp. In front of me, I have little bowls on top of a baking sheet. I always bake these on a baking sheet because if anything oozes out, you won't get your oven messy. The bowls that I'm using are shaped like little apples, so cute. I found these at Crate and Barrel. I'll put a link down below if they're still available. Scoop in your fresh apples. Fill it to the top of the bowl. I'm overfilling the bowl because while they bake, they will sink down a little bit into the dish. Every single one I'm doing is falling out of here! Then, cover the top with our crumble mixture. Ohh! This is so great! Our apple crisps are assembled and ready to bake. Heat your oven to 375 and bake for 30 minutes. Do-doo! Homemade apple crisps Still warm, perfect time for a bite. Mmm, mm-mm-mmm! The next treat we're making are these chocolate caramel apple slice pops. The things you'll need to make these chocolate caramel apple slice pops will be 3 large Honeycrisp apples, use the tallest ones you can find to get the longest strips, 1 cup of white candy melts, 1 1/2 cups of dark coating chocolate, 12 caramels (unwrapped), 2 tablespoons of water, 1 teaspoon of citric acid, and some popsicle sticks. First step to making these apple pops is cutting some large apple slices. Cut the very edge of the apple off. Second cut, you want to stay outside the core right up to it. Then, cut this piece in half. Oooooh! Those are going to be some apples pops! Once you have your apple slices, sprinkle a little citric acid on both sides. Citric acid kind of looks like salt. You can find this at any health food store, vitamin store. This helps prevent browning of the apples and helps pull the liquid out of the apple so that our chocolate will stick. Now, take your slices and place them on top of a baking sheet lined with a paper towel. You can probably get 4 apple pops per apple, and with the excess apples... Once you have all of your apple slices cut, let them sit out for 10 minutes to dry, and while they're drying, we're going to get some of our decorations ready. Time to heat up all of these toppings! Over here, I have a heat-safe glass measuring cup. Pour in your caramel candies. *clink*\nOh! Oh jeez. And add 2 tablespoons of water. Then, take it over to the microwave and heat until it's smooth. Microwave and heat for about a minute. I'm sweating. Oh, that was nice. That's nice. And then stir. You want a smooth creamy texture. *gasp* This smells so good! *sniff* *sigh* I just want to put this in my coffee. And heat up your chocolate and candy melts. Chocolate's in there right now. And I'm waiting for it. \u266bWaiting for it, waiting for the chocolate\u266b Um... To assemble these apple pops, take a popsicle stick and slide them into the bottom of the apple about 2/3 of the way in. Spoon the chocolate over the apple to coat. Do this to both sides. Once your apple pop is covered, give it a little jiggle, allow the excess chocolate to drip off back into the bowl, and then place onto a piece of wax paper to set. Then, do this to the rest of your apple pops. Apple pops are dipped. I've given them a few minutes to set. Now, final step, drizzle with a little bit of caramel and white chocolate. It's okay to get a little bit messy because the wax paper is underneath. \u266bGet in my face, you yummy little pops\u266b So good. Are you kidding me? Why do they even do caramel apples? Those are so hard to eat. They should just sell them like this! Do-Doo! And there you have it, chocolate caramel apple slice pops. If you like chocolate-dipped fruit or caramel apples, this is the treat for you. I'm gonna have some now. Mmm, mm-mm-mmm! This is delicious. The last treat that we're making are these homemade apple fries. They're just like French fries, only they're made out of apples. The things you'll need to make these apple fries will be 2 large Fuji apples--again, you'll want the tallest ones so you can get the longest fries. Some vegetable oil for frying, 1 cup of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon. Making apple fries is super easy. I first saw these when I was at a fair, and I thought *gasp*  \"We've gotta make those!\" First step, peel your apples. Again, I'm using Fujis. Now, we're going to cut our fries. We're going to be cutting the apples into large pieces. Like a large steak fries. Cut right on the edge of the core on both sides of the apple. Now, cut off the smaller sides. We're not going to let any piece of apple go to waste. For me! Finish cutting up your apples, make as many as you'd like, and then take them over to the stove. Fill a large pan halfway with oil. Turn your temperature to medium high. Let the oil heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm using a candy thermometer. Add your apples and fry for 3 minutes. Then, remove your apple fries from the oil, onto a baking sheet lined with some paper towels. Our apple fries are hot off the stove. I have them on a cookie sheet on top of a paper towel to absorb the extra oil. And here, I've got a large bowl. Add the sugar and cinnamon. Mix your sugar and cinnamon until evenly combined. Yum! This is everything that I love, all together. We've got apples, French fries, and like, you know, churros. You know. It's basically like every dessert together that I love. Now toss in all of your apple fries and mix them around. \u266bHeaven must be missing an apple\u266b Now, pick up your apple fries, and place 'em on a plate or in a bowl. I've got this cute little- Look at, it looks like you're at the fair. I'm using tongs to allow the excess sugar and cinnamon to drip off. Do-doo! Here's the homemade apple fries. You can serve them in a little boat, or I found these little fry boxes online. *gasp* But you could just stick 'em in here and share! I gotta do that. I gotta put some in there. I can touch all these ones 'cause I'm going to eat 'em. Oh. My. Gosh. Look. At. That. *smuck* Eee! After all that, gotta have one. Mmm, mm-mm-mmm! It's like a baked apple pie. Mm! Ta~Daaa! Here are the 3 DIY apple treats that we made today. Individual homemade apple crisps, chocolate caramel apple slice pops, and apple fries. These cute little containers, it's just too much. All of these recipes are delicious, and they're really easy to make.

It's Gary Dinstuhl again here at\nTweetsie Fudge Works and today we're going to be making a crowd-pleaser\nour world-famous caramel apples. Caramel apples are something that have been\naround for a long time. I like to use a tart apple like a wine sap or something\nlike that to contrast a little bit with the sweet caramel.  Today we're going to\nbe using Granny Smith apples one of my favorite apples.  The first thing we do is\nobviously inspect all the apples. Whatever Apple you buy has\nbeen coated with some sort of wax to make the apple shine.  We've got to get\nrid of that wax or the caramel won't stick to it.  So each apple is washed then\nit's hand dried.  After the apples have dried we go over the apples and we pull\nthe stems off all the apples and the reason that we do that is because the\nnext step is putting the sticks in the Apple and so you remove the stem so that\nwhen you set the Apple down it will sit flat. Then we go through the caramel preparation.  Caramel is basically just sugar and milk.  It's boiled together and that's called the Maillard reaction the\ncaramelization.  After we have that then we dip the apples in the caramel and we\nspin the apple to remove the excess caramel and then we set the apples down\non sugar.  The reason that we use sugar is that it keeps the bottom of the apple\ndry that way the caramel the sticky caramel doesn't stick to the tray and\nwe're going to put them after that they sit for about 20 or 30 minutes for the\ncaramel to cool and and we move them to a clean tray and move them into our\ndisplay case then they're ready to sell! Thanks for watching and please come back\nand watch more tips from the Fudge Works here at Tweetsie and remember we have\nlots of free samples so please come and visit us.", "NE10Y6yMAR4": "[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] bye [Music] now [Music] do [Music] now [Music] down [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] wow [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow [Music]", "9ait7l0Ydzc": "- All right, guys, so here we go. I have all my stuff ready here, and we're gonna make some caramel apples. I saw this on Pinterest. I thought it would be\neasy and fun to make, so we're not making the entire apple, we're just making wedges. I thought that was good, too. Let me show you what you need. So, I have here some milk\nchocolate, white chocolate, and obviously you could get dark chocolate and you don't have to get white chocolate. My husband just prefers white chocolate, so I wanted to make\nsure I had some for him. I prefer milk chocolate,\nso I got a small bar because not everybody here likes that, but everybody likes white chocolate. So, I got the big bag of those. And then I got some of\nthese caramel bites. And they look like they're really easy to melt. Now these are almonds that I have put into the blender and\nground up really fine. Because I'm making wedges I wanted to make sure everything\nwas grounded really fine. These are graham crackers. This is coconut sugar with\na little bit of cinnamon. This is Heath Bars. My husband loves those. This is shredded cara-- Or, not caramel. This is shredded coconut. I have three granny apples, and I have three red delicious apples. I have some of these cute little sticks that I'll put in each of the wedges. These are popsicle-- They're not. Are they popsicle sticks? Yeah, I guess they're\nlike popsicle sticks. You can find them in the area of the store where they have like\ncake decoration stuff, and things like that or candy making area. I have some wax paper, and then I have this. And I know this is kind of strange, but this is citrus soda. And the reason I got this, first is zero calories,\nand I love this stuff, but also because it has-- Where are the ingredients? Here. If you look at the ingredients, you'll see it says citric acid, and what you want to do is when you cut your apples into the different wedges, you want to dip them in\na little bit of this, so that they don't turn brown. The citric acid prevents\nthem from turning brown. So that is all you need. I will start melting each of these. And I will show you\nguys how they turn out. (energetic, bouncy acoustic music) We're gonna start with chocolate coconut, will be the first wedges that I have. And I put everything\nhere around the wax paper just so I have it all ready to go. And then I'm gonna melt milk chocolate with some of that. (upbeat, bouncy acoustic music) While that's melting, I'm gonna put the little sticks in the wedges. (upbeat, bouncy acoustic music) We're gonna do the caramel now, and I just opened this\npack of the little bits, I put them in a cup, and I'm\nput 'em in the microwave, but here's a tip: here are\nthe coconut ones I just did, and I did a chocolate with\nsome of the ground almonds, but I forgot to put a stick in it before, and it's impossible to add\nthe stick after the fact. So, here's a tip: have\nthe wedges ready to go because this stuff, once you melt it, it starts to dry pretty quickly. So, have the sticks already\nin the apple wedges. Just as soon as you can,\njust have those ready to go. Okay, so don't do this. Do this. (upbeat, bouncy acoustic music) Hey guys, so I'm gonna continue here, but let me tell you what I think so far. I think this Pinterest idea is a fail. I'm sure that the, I'm\nsure that the apples with all these amazing\nthings on them taste great. So, I'm not saying it's\na fail for the taste, but it's a fail because it is a hard, it's not as easy as they make it seem. So, let me tell you,\nthey start to turn brown even though you put that\ncitric acid on them. Remember to put the sticks\nin if you're gonna try this. Don't just leave them like this because these things\ndry out really quickly. So, if you're gonna try it,\nput the sticks in first, and have them ready to go. But I have some here already. We have some chocolate coconut here. This is white chocolate with\nthe coconut cinnamon sugar. This is caramel with some Heath Bar. This is white chocolate with a little bit of everything,\nI think, I sprinkled on top. I did the coconut sugar,\nI did the Heath Bar, I did the graham cracker, I did the almonds on that one. And then on this one, I added everything, and then I also added some coconut. And this one is caramel with\ncinnamon sugar, and almonds. This one is a little bit of everything, you can see it all piled up in there, except, instead of the white chocolate I did caramel underneath this one. And then this is just milk\nchocolate with almonds on top. So, they look great, but they\nare very, very hard to do. And again, this is three\napples, and one green apple, and is way too much, at least for me. I mean, if you're gonna spend all day doing this, I guess it would be worth it. I guess you should try\nand see if you like it. I hope you found this video fun. I will continue to look\nfor things on Pinterest, to see if I can make\nthem, but this was hard. This was hard.", "CKDN0AZvBLQ": "this is punk girl blogs and I am going to go outside today so well let's go yeah right now I am eating a caramel sucker they are really good right let's go check on

favorite things about the trip this year was a bakery that we found that had these ginormous chocolate and caramel dip apples they were huge and they were delicious and oh my gosh I have been dreaming about them ever since and those are one of my favorite things about all time usually that's the only time I eat them and so I wanted to share with you guys some tips and tricks and making your own candied apples alright for this video I want to really concentrate on the gourmet process of the caramel apples so I'm just going to refresh very quickly on the caramel part you can go to a previous video that we already have that concentrates I'm just the caramel apple so I've already put my stick on and I already have my caramel already and I'm going to dip my apples for the first half of these gourmet candy apples and get those ready to go and then we'll be ready to go to the chocolate portion but one thing I wanted to tell you was this year I found in the grocery aisle these caramel bits and I like them didn't have to unwrap all the individually wrapped squares so if you don't have a homemade recipe that you love and you wanna just do the pre-made caramel I highly recommend it this one okay here is your tips and instruction for melting the chocolate so on these apples I'm going to use milk chocolate for the actual dipping of the apple and then I'm going or sorry to your Dilla grant and then for my white chocolate drizzle but I'm going to do on top I'm actually going to use the candy wafers and here's why um the last couple times for some reason when I use the Ghirardelli white chocolate brand I have problems melting it so I don't know if it's just me or if it's not meant to do that I'm not quite sure but I don't want you to waste your money so for the white part I recommend the way first because it's much easier so what you're going to do on both of them is if you're going to do the microwave version I just put them in a Tupperware container and I melt them 30 seconds at a time it shouldn't take longer than a minute I have to maximum two minutes but I only go in 30-second intervals so that you can stir in between each one so let me get my chocolate melted and get to the next step okay now we get to the really exciting and delicious part of this where we're going to take our apple and these are already cooled from the refrigerator and you can see that when I was peeling them off they got a little messed up so with my clean hands I'm just going to poke that down and I also trimmed up the bottom flooding part that oozes down to the bottom with just some kitchen scissors and I'm ready to dip so for my chocolate I chose to use Ghirardelli chocolate chips you can use whatever you have on hand or whatever you prefer chocolate wise it can be Hershey's it can be the candied disks whatever you can find your area and then for toppings today I have Eminem mini M&Ms because they stick better and I have chopped up some Reese's peanut butter cups so that we have a peanut fleet peanut butter flavor and I have here some chopped peanuts and some chopped pretzels and I'll show you how each of those turn out but for this one I think I'm going to use the mini M&Ms and I'm going to take my Apple and as you can see I already have it all melted and I'm going to dunk it down and just roll it about 3/4 of the way up the caramel and then let that drip off and I'm not going all the way up to the top because there's yet more deliciousness that's going to go up there you want to let that you don't want that to pool a whole lot so I'm wiping it just a little bit like that okay then you're going to go right to your toppings and you can either dunk it or you can roll it around you can spoon them on however you like Oh My heavens this is going to be overload okay so that's how we're going to look and we'll put that one on there now I'll do this one and get my knife and we'll put some Reese's peanut butter cups on it and then those are going to need to go back in the refrigerator to cool for about 10 to 15 minutes and we'll do the very last process at that point one little tip I wanted to share with you guys if you're filling you can use either a disposable decorator bag or a ziplock baggie whichever you have on hand I always put mine in a cup that way you can use both hands to get the chocolate in there rather than trying to hold with one and do the other because it takes more than two hands the cup is your third alright when I said gourmet I meant gourmet and so we're going to take now some white chocolate that I melted and we're going to cut off the tip of it and I don't want it to be you you just need to figure out you want a big flow or a tiny flow and so the size of the hole that you cut is going to determine how much comes out so first I'm going to take the white and I'm only going to work one at a time and you're going to need to spin your Apple around so I'm going to take the chocolate and I'm just going to give it this action and you can practice on a piece of paper or something like that if you're not sure how well you're going to do at first it's not hard you're just doing kind of a zigzag motion and you can take that down all right and then finally I'm going to take more of my milk chocolate and I'm going to go just a little bit more on top of that to give it a oh my holy crap look total cuteness and deliciousness right there okay here's our final look this is our peanut our M&M our pretzel and our Reese's Peanut Butter Cup if you're having a party or an event that you need display for it then I would use a jumbo baking cup for that purpose thank you so much for watching don't forget you can always go to show me cute calm for more information on this video and don't forget to subscribe and you can also follow us on Twitter Pinterest Instagram and Facebook bye see you next week you", "4_WEqXl_PMM": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome back to my channel in this video i'm going to show you guys how i made this caramel apples with chocolate and pretzels with caramel and chocolate i hope you guys like this idea and we're going to begin by washing our apples i wash them with really hot water i don't boil my apples since these are not candy apples this is just for caramel and the caramel sticks pretty good and i like to scrub my apples with paper towels and also the paper towel is going to help you to remove the little stem from each apple a lot easier with the paper towel and once you're done washing them we're going to dry them really good before we dip them in the caramel and now i'm going to go ahead and place one of these wood sticks i like using this sticks because these are a little bit thin and with this sticks you can place a straw over this stick so these are really nice and since the apples are all in different shapes it's kind of hard to place the sticks or to have them all even so what i do is i try to look for the high part of the apple and i face it towards me and on that side that's where you're going to place the stick and this way you kind of get all your sticks um nice and straight and this is the apples that i'm using this is the granny smith apples these are the smaller ones but you can also get the bigger ones this is a caramel that i like to use this caramel you can find it at sprouts i like using this caramel because it's really easy to work with but you can use any caramel that you like or maybe you have a recipe and the way i use this caramel is i put it in a pan and i just melt it until it's nice and smooth like this you just have to keep mixing and don't let it burn you're also going to need some wax paper to place your apples and now we're going to go ahead and dip our apples in the caramel and to dip them in the caramel is really easy just twist it in the caramel and let all the excess drip down and just place it in the wax paper [Music] and now i'm going to cover my apples in chocolate but before you do this part you have to let your apples go down your caramel has to be really really cold before you do this part or your chocolate is not going to say you can also cover your apples in caramel a day before and then cover them in chocolate at the next day and this work this way it works a lot better and now i'm going to cover some pretzel rods in chocolate and i'm also going to add a little bit of caramel i'm using this candies you can find this at walmart you can also use these caramel candies to make your apples and they taste really good and now to make these pretzels i'm going to just place these candies in the microwave for like 10 seconds and then you're just going to roll them and to place them in the pretzels is really easy to start from the top and just twist it all around and it's going to give this really nice design [Music] and now i'm going to go ahead and just cover my pretzel and chocolate i'm going to be using my spoon to add the chocolate or if you're going to be making a lot you can also just transfer your chocolate to a cup that it's a little deep and just dip it in there but you can also just add the chocolate with a spoon and now just let the chocolate drip down and you can add any sprinkles of your choice [Music] and now for my next apples i'm going to cover them in white chocolate in case if your chocolate is a little bit thick you can always add a little bit of coconut oil and for my last apple i'm not going to cover it in chocolate i'm just going to add this little candies these m m's i'm just going to place them all over the apple [Music] and now with my yellow apple i'm going to make a chick apple so i'm going to begin by making a chicken crust with this orange chocolate the best i can and i'm going to let it dry and now with my yellow color i'm going to make the little big i'm going to just make it like into a triangle and then the little two eyes with my black chocolate i'm also going to add a little bit of white chocolate just to make it look more like a real eye and now i'm going to make the wings and the two legs and now with my pink edible dust i'm going to add some cheeks or just some blush around it i'm also going to make some eyelashes with my black chocolate and now i'm going to add the crust and i also made this little bowl with this mold i made it with chocolate and i'm just going to glue it with white chocolate and for my next apples i'm just going to drizzle some chocolate and i'm going to add some sprinkles on the side and i also have this bunnies these are icing decorations and i'm just going to place one and this is going to give them a really nice design and for my next one i'm just going to drizzle some lines and just place one of these icing decorations and for each of my apples i did a matching pretzel for my m m one i just added some of the m m's around it and now i'm going to add a paper straw this paper straws i bought them at the 99 cent store these are a little bit long so just measure it and just cut it i also made these really cute bows for my apples they're really easy to make i'm going to make them out of this big bows i bought this bose at the 99 cent store or if you have ribbon at your house you can also just use a regular ribbon but i really like these colors and for a dollar you can get like five little bows with this bow so all i did it was um just cut four pieces so i cut two of the big ribbon and two of the smaller one and i just tie it in the middle and i just use the same string that came with the bow and now we have a really cute bow i also found this necklace at the 99 cent store it has like cute bunnies so i just cut one and just glue it with my glue gun and now we have a cute bow i hope you guys like this idea i also made this other colors for all my apples [Music] and if you want to make this as a gift i want to give you a quick idea on how you can pack this i have this basket where you can place all your apples you can place your apples in this cupcake liners this one is special for apples but this one is for like bigger apples so i'm going to place them in k-cup liners and they look really cute and they fit perfect so i'm going to place all my four apples and i'm going to place my pretzels just around it and i just place a bag over my basket and just put a nice bow and you have a really nice gift right here i also found this box at walmart it was for only 2.99 and i think it's a really nice box because it came with everything with a bag and a bow and i just placed my pretzels on the sides my apples but when i tried placing the bag the pretzels wouldn't stay standing up so i had to place them on the bottom and now the best part of the video for me is to try the apples and i have this slicer to cut my apples perfect and i just want to show you guys the caramel looks delicious and it was delicious i hope you guys try making these apples i hope you guys like this video if you guys did don't forget to subscribe to my channel to like my video to share my videos don't forget to follow me on instagram tik tok and facebook and i'll see you guys on the next video bye bye [Music] [Music] you", "zTIsp_Z19aY": "hi everybody welcome back to my channel so as fall has arrived and it looks like winter here where I live because a few snowflakes have fallen I am getting into the mood of holiday baking and when I think about holiday baking I know this is probably a year-round thing but I usually think about caramel apples pies that sort of thing so today I attempted to make caramel apples for the first time a little bit of the process was a fail I tried to revive it I wasn't sure if I was gonna post the video when I was halfway through with it but I went ahead and still decided to edit this video I will show you how I failed how I fixed it another part where I failed and fixed it again and let me show you the final result so that you can continue to watch and also the reason that I did this that I decided to post my failure anyway is to show you that even though you started or you start to practice something that you've never made before to still continue through the process started continue it and finish it so that next time you know what you did wrong and so that you can prove to yourself that you can always keep practicing and get better at it obviously I plan to practice these apples and I hope to one day be better no I don't hope I am gonna be better at them one day so here's how they look this is what we're making today they obviously didn't look like this throughout the entire thing so I am gonna show you how I failed how I fixed it and how they turned out like this so let's get right to the video the first thing that I'm going to do is to clean my apples as you can see here you can see some of the wax that is on my Apple so I have a pot of hot water and I'm adding in a quarter cup of white vinegar and I'm also adding one tablespoon of baking soda and this concoction is going to help to loosen up the wax from the apples now I'm going to start dipping my apples into this water and I did set a timer so every time I put apples in I leave them in there no longer than 10 seconds otherwise your apples will cook and just in case you haven't made apples like I hadn't before the reasoning for this step is to make sure that we remove the wax so that the caramel or the candy that we are using sticks to the surface of the Apple and here you can see that the wax has been loosened up it's those little specks of white so I did go ahead and take a textured kitchen towel and I rubbed off all of the wax in all of my apples after I finished with this step I did go ahead and submerge my apples in a clean bath of water and clean them with a completely different towel to make sure that they were wiped clean and dry for the next step now here is the part where everything started going wrong and this is the making of the caramel for my apples I will place the exact measurements that I used for this caramel in the description box I did go ahead and add butter brown sugar I put in a little bit of corn syrup and I also used vanilla as my flavoring as well as sweetened condensed milk and again all of these ingredients and the measurements will be listed below and you will see what I'm talking about later on in the video as to why everything started going wrong so for caramel in case you haven't made caramel yourself at home before it is recommended to use a candy thermometer especially if you are trying to reach different textures for example soft caramel hard caramel in this case I wanted to bring my caramel up to 245 degrees to the point where was a little bit soft but not to the point where it was falling off my Apple this process did take approximately between 10 to 15 minutes so I did go ahead and speed up this portion of the video [Music] during this part I was still very confident that everything was going to work out and I was just waiting for my temperature to reach 245 degrees and as you can see after a while my caramel did start bubbling and it did start to reach that temperature this is the part where I added the vanilla and not necessarily what where everything went wrong because it was already wrong before it started but as you can see from here it does look a little bit oily on the sides and I thought that this was normal not because I haven't made caramel before but I just thought that this was the normal for this recipe so I did go ahead and swirl it with a little spatula for a while and then I just decided to go for it and dip it and this is what happened my caramel was just not sticking to the apples and I just thought that I was dipping the Apple wrong for a minute I thought that I had not cleaned my apples the right way or that I didn't wait enough before dipping my apples so at this point I did want to throw away the caramel but I decided to give it another try and do some research but before all the research I did say you know maybe it's just that one Apple and I took another apple dipped it and the same thing happened and the caramel was just not sticking and at this point I still didn't know that the problem was the caramel you can clearly see it on the Apple so upon researching I did find that obviously all of your ingredients have to be at the same temperature I did do this video at a spur of the moment so I threw in my butter and it was ice cold literally from the refrigerator it was not at room temperature so the shock between the 245 degrees and the fact that my butter was not at room temperature is was what caused the separation so essentially what I did is I turned on the stove again and on very very low heat I slowly started to stir my caramel to the point where all of the ingredients were at the same temperature and luckily it came back together as you can see here not too perfect some bubbles but I still went with it because I had already gone through the trouble now here's the second part where everything went wrong initially I used to use Wilton candy melts and they worked fine as long as you added some vegetable shortening for some reason I do believe that they have undergone a change in their formula or the way that they make this chocolate so for some reason it didn't work for me and at the end of the day when it was melted it took a long time to melt and then it was just a little bit I don't even know how to explain it but it was breaking on me so some parts of it were hot and then other parts were just not coming together so I threw it away and started over with this almond candy coating and I did go ahead and melt it in my same Wilton pot added a little bit of vegetable shortening and here is the result now for this part what I did wrong is that I did not wait for my chocolate to come back down to temperature and I immediately took it exactly as it is here which was very hot and dipped my apples causing it to be very thin and allowing all of my mistakes the little bubbles and the little crevices to be noticeable and you will see that here and as you can see along with that problem my chocolate was nine not entirely melted and there was little pieces of chocolate that had not melted regardless at this point I think I was so frustrated and I wasn't willing to give up and throw away these apples because I had already invested too much time and effort into them so what I did is I stood here I dipped all the apples in this runny chocolate I allowed them to dry and I at the end of the day what I did is I let them dry overnight and I said you know what I'm just gonna come back tomorrow and finish them it is now the next day and what I decided to do is irie melted the chocolate that I melted the day before and as you can see here's how my apples dried they're not very pretty you can see some of the caramel you can see a little bit of holes and bubbles and I just decided to read dip them again added another layer and I said you know what if this doesn't work then at least I tried but and you can see the rest of the apples here they are all very thin so the layer of chocolate is not even thick enough to cover the caramel so I read it everything twice and let them dry and then as you do in cakes I said well maybe I can cover the bumps the holes and all of the crevices with some sprinkles so I took a little bag and I placed some of my chocolate into this bag I left my warmer arm so that the chocolate wouldn't get hard inside the bag and I simply cut a tiny little hole and just kind of swirled it onto my Apple and added these sprinkles from a sprinkle pop in case you are curious this is the hashtag blessed sprinkle pop mix and I think it worked pretty well so I tried several different things and several different ways of adding these lines at the end I think I was very satisfied with how the first Apple looked so I just continued with that look rather than with this where I skipped a few spaces and you would be able to see some of the crevices and the bumps so I'm going to let you watch what I did to the rest of my apples okay so now that you saw the entire process it was a little bit crazy it was a little bit wild I wanted to cry literally my husband walked into the kitchen and I was like you ruined it it's ruined and he felt so bad it really wasn't his fault it was my fault for the caramel or caramel at first and then the chocolate like literally it just wasn't working for me but I've had these apples in this project like in my head for so long and I thought it was gonna work I thought everything was gonna go great I thought it was gonna go smooth and I was like yeah it's like for a minute I I thought to myself and this sounds a little bit arrogant but I was like I can do other things like these are just apples right like I got this but I don't got this girl I don't got it at all I need a lot more practice I they turned out pretty pretty okay for my first time they have some bumps they have some bubbles they have some weird aspects to them but overall I think I did pretty good so yeah hopefully next time that I bring you a Apple video they turn out better than this time so I have a cutting board here this feels like I'm doing a mock phone or a mukbang whatever that's called so I'm gonna cut it and I'm gonna see how they turned out [Music] they're so good you guys they might not be the prettiest they might not be like the coolest ones the coolest apples like on the block and I might not be like a super like Apple Pro but they turned out delicious and they turned out great so now that you've seen the entire video don't forget to give this video like if you liked it if you try it let me know in the comments below don't forget to share this video this failed video with your friends and subscribe before you go I'll talk to you next time bye [Music]", "zzvzc4tPwwo": "hello everyone and welcome back to the cozy chair can you see I'm not in my chair today I am in my kitchen because I want to teach you how to make my very very favorite Halloween treat ah caramel apples I just love caramel apples how about you well I have a couple of tricks to show you today so stick around the first one is finding the right stick see these really tough sticks when I try and bend them they don't bend instead of at the store you'll find little skewers or popsicle sticks don't try to make them with those they'll break and that'll be really really frustrating so get your sucker six and just push them right into the very middle of your Apple now it's kind of a little bit hard but you want it to be nice and in there really deep so that they're strong when you're pulling them out of the caramel the stick won't come out now here's just a little and here's a little piece of advice if you're making a whole bunch you can flip them over and count them just like now on the table they'll get nice and deep and it'll work really really well I'll set this back here so you'll see um the other thing is if you're making a whole bunch like I've made up to like 251 times just go grab a hammer the hammer works really well so I'll just get all of these all of these in so you can see now that I have all of my sticks in my apples the next thing is the caramel now I know a lot of people make their homemade caramel I don't I've never got a torte out very well so I buy Peter's caramel I love this stuff can you believe it it is a whole slew of caramel it's not all the way amazing stuff so when you buy this it makes it out thirty apples give or take a few I usually get this one it's Halloween or Christmas I love them for Christmas gifts but you can also make caramel apples for teachers or for school fundraisers so I'm gonna get that caramel I just took a piece off of it and I put it in a bowl and now looks melted okay so I just got my caramel microwave and microwave - in a microwave-safe bowl and it's pretty bubbly in there and it's very very thin I like it to be really thin because then I don't get big puddles and it's easy - it's really easy to dip when it's thin now here is the next tip when you are making apples do not use regular tinfoil it will be a mess for you instead use this look Reynolds Wrap nonstick now this is your best friend when you make caramel apples so I just take my apple and I'm gonna dip it in that really really runny caramel and I were lit around I turn it really really really fast and I scrape off the bottom the reason I do that is so you don't get a big pool of caramel at the very bottom so I take that just set it right there on top of my nonstick Reynolds Wrap now when you use that you don't have to worry about what side because both sides of the wrap are nonstick so I am going now to dip all of these apples see how pretty they look they look so pretty and I'm gonna let them harden before I do the next layer the chocolate layer except for the last two I'm going to do a couple which is caramels and nuts I know that a lot of people like their caramel apples with just caramel and nuts so I have a lot of different kinds today that we're gonna try we're gonna try Oreo and white chocolate and butter finger and white chocolate we're going to try graham cracker which is my favorite and we're also going to try um cinnamon and sugar a lot of people really like cinnamon and sugar ones as well because it tastes like hi okay so I'm gonna dip all of these now when I'm getting low on my caramel and it's getting hard to kind of spin it and dip it then it's time to lean out your caramel the nice thing about this caramel is you can remelt it in the microwave as many times as you need to and when you run out then you can always add a little bit more and you don't have to clean the bowl beforehand it won't burn the caramel that is already in there so I'm going to cut off a little bit more and go put a little bit more caramel in the microwave okay I'm back again dipping my last Apple um before doing the nuts now this one I just want you to see how pretty they turn out if you want to just make just caramel apples it's not pretty they are they turn out so beautiful just what's the plain caramel but if you're going to do a topping on the caramel then you want to make sure to do a log with caramel is wet um if you want it just directly on the caramel so I'll show you right now I'm going to put nuts on this Apple so I have my caramel I'm still gonna spin it around I don't want it the big puddle on the bottom I'm gonna scrape it off the bottom and then I'm going to just tap tap it into the nuts while the caramel is hot you won't have very good luck with this if your caramel is not hot okay so you can go all the way up to the top if you want sometimes offspring flip to the top sometimes I like just a plain caramel okay now look at that is it oh it's dripping a little bit but we can just scrape that off again and isn't that beautiful so here is a nut and an apple and a caramel apple with nuts I'm gonna do that one more time I turn this Apple and I have seen a lot of places that just have apples along the bottom and I think that can look really nice too so I'm going to take this well let's get that so I'm going to take this and I'm just gonna roll just the bottom all along those nuts now keep in mind that it's not gonna sit as flat as the other ones but it will have nuts along the bottom you can always just tap the bottom to make sure it's nice and strong so there's another one we've got that one there too okay now what we're going to do is the rest of these we're going to cover with other things we're going to put white chocolate on and then some other toppings fun toppings like chocolate chips and Orioles and butterfingers so I'm gonna pull these over here and I'll show you okay we are ready now to do our white chocolate layer I have all of these other toppings out because when you do the white chocolate layer you have to do the other thing right away you can't wait until the white chocolate melts so I have these guitars and button appeals or little like chocolate buttons and they are really great for melting don't use regular chocolate chips from the grocery store I'll show you these a little up close because these you can remount um so if you're--if starts getting a little bit too hard you can remount it and see how beautiful this is nice and just like silky no bumps you don't want any any clumps in there nice and smooth when it's melted like that in the microwave you're going to take your Apple and you're going to roll it just like we did with the caramel we're gonna roll it around but here it's very very important that you whip it really really well the reason is I've made these with people and they will fall right off the toppings will fall right off if the white chocolate layer is thick so the first time we're gonna try is a cinnamon sugar so I take this again I'm gonna slide it right along the bottom of the bowl top lip of the bowl and I'm just gonna Pat it and this cinnamon sugar one is a really big hit people call it an apple pie apple and they look really cute and pretty so there's one of those we're going to do two of each of these topics so again I'm gonna do the same thing Twista I'm just twisting it between my finger and my thumb whipping it around really really well gliding the bottom off on that top ledge of the bowl I'm tapping it through my cinnamon and sugar you don't really want to roll it because that will cause your your chocolate to Ripple and they don't look as pretty so just a nice tap ok our next did you see how easy these just plop they just pull up so easy trust me I've done it the other way before such a mess okay another flavor that people like or another topping is mini chocolate chips I think they look really cute on caramel apples I think caramel apples make a great present I love giving these like I said Christmas Halloween things like this now these don't stick on as well but you just kind of tap them on there some of them will fall off and that's okay it'll be okay we'll let that one settle do this again I guess with the chocolate with the chocolate chips it is a little easier to roll and they will they will stick just a little bit better than taffy okay next one is Oreo I don't know about your family but in my family we have a lot of Oriole fans so I have crushed up Oreos here I just put them in a ziplock crush them with a rolling pin and just because I don't I don't really like it when they're pulsed in the in the Vitamix or Blendtec I think they're just a little too fine but I do pulse the graham crackers and in the bland back so they're super fine but on the Oriole one I like it kind of chunky I like it kind of filling a little bit I don't know just bulky and big and so delicious so I'm gonna do another now I know that during Halloween they actually make orange Oreos while the filling is orange so one Halloween I make caramel apples and I crushed up Halloween Oreos and people thought that was really fun at least kids did anyway I'm not such a big fan of the orange Orioles but I know people who are so again another really bulky very beautiful Oreo at the end of this I will get you right up close to these so you can see what they look like another really fun flavor is Butterfinger I took just a couple of these two candy bars crush them up actually in their package butterfingers crumble really really easy I kind of tapped them on the counter and open the package of boredom out they're gonna be similar to the Orioles where they're just a little bulky a little big but kind of fun to pick it up tap tap and roll tuck and roll trying to get it nice and even I like to leave a little bit of space on the top of the Apple where I can see the white and it and the caramel so people know exactly what they are getting when they bite into that Apple here is my second Butterfinger Apple like I said these are a hit with kids but I have to admit that I saved my very favorite topping for the end it's nothing exciting it's actually just ground-up graham crackers but you have got to trust me and try it so roll your Apple in the white chocolate this one's going to go on very similar to the way that the cinnamon and sugar went onto your apples okay bottom dude just a nice tap the tapping really works the best with graham crackers I don't know what it is about graham crackers I think they make it look the most beautiful and maybe that's just because that's the kind my sister taught me I don't know all about the way to make caramel apples because of my sister she would make caramel apples for everyone in my entire family and I have a really really big family so whenever I see a caramel apple with graham cracker on it mm-hmm just reminds me of my sister and I love that so this is my last Apple giving it a good tap tap tap tap tap through all of this and now we are done we have nutty apples and and graham cracker apples Butterfinger apples Oreo Apple's chocolate chip apples and cinnamon sugar apples thank you so much for coming and learning this with

today what you'll need is two cups of sugar and you'll need 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup 1 cup of water and a pivoting spoon of salt some coloring some flavoring and some sticks ok few other things and I'll show you that as we go along ok so first I'm going to add the water to my pot and dimension if the edge of the teaspoon of salt in there and 2 cups of sugar and my corn syrup corn syrup the secret ingredient and candy-making okay I'll bring it over here and hide watch it it's going to stir it around I can't do thermometers ready to go in but it's not going to go into really the sugar tenses on so we'll wait a moment a few minutes and then I'll show you putting the candy thermometer in what it looks like okay then it's ready to put the thermometer in when you when you lift out your spoon and you look at the liquid and there's no little grains of sugar you know that it's ready to have that the monitor print okay Molly to the bulb of mom should be underneath the liquid we're going to wait for it to get to 300 I'll stir it only occasionally very carefully okay that's all okay I'm preparing the aluminum foil for the lollipops I have some sticks just little sticks I'm going to put a little teeny bit oil and shiny very very thin coat and then if when I place the lollipop sticks that I work this was one that long so I'm going to put the lollipop stick down so the part that's broken is it's going to be inside the stick okay so I'm going to do it this way so one lollipop will be here and one will be there and then I guess my homie there here that's it okay okay so this reached 310 degrees and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of color this is red color because I want these are going to be strawberry strawberry lollipops Australia this is too and we will also add lollipop trays want to see what color this is coming out to not quite it's not going to be very bright red but strawberries are really a great red that should be good enough and we'll add a little strawberry this is strawberry oil and you can get this a cat candy supply store and I always measure first into into the lid and it's sort of hard to know if it's really going to be right because it's hard to taste it went so hot but um you can just hope so he smells good but it's better to have it be a little less flavorful thank you favorable because of the aftertaste of the oils okay and then it's just a matter of pouring your lollipop on top of your hmm I think you said this way and you just not sometimes you try to reevaluate it's going to be a pretty big lollipop if you hold it still in one place that it helps make it more help to make it round okay okay well that's good thank you so much for joining us well let those close and you will see you put in effect in a moment you can also use your lollipop if you have to go to your candy supply store they have special molds that can handle very high heat okay and you want to spray it a little bit with some a little bit of oil okay it off a little but you can just pour lollipop right in here [Music] fill up your squares that you can try to fill the squares up better okay now what you can do is you can take your okay and just go back and forth fill up all the little fill up all those little holes then when you pop them out it will they'll break okay now what you want to do is wait for the candy to cool and then you'll be ready to turn it over and pop it out okay so this is our strawberry candy and we're just going to knock it out okay and result this is one just wait you'll have little pieces of strawberry candy okay and then we have our lollipop our lollipop sir come right off tray just enough mmm very good that's my lollipop now thank you very much for joining us and we'll see you soon bye", "drXWmZ0hgWw": "you can do like cookie dough you could do miss Oreos are you just really excited yeah I do love caramel apples but the thing is I feel like they're just really hard to eat sometimes they're just first we're gonna clean our apples my friend has some fruit and vegetable wash which I thought was pretty funny she just squirted them and then rinse them off and then we dried the apples off because if they're wet that caramel doesn't stick very good then I just kind of sliced them in little chunks cut out the core and then to make the caramel if you want it thicker or we're running it you just kind of change up the milk to get this we just added half a cup of milk then you make a slice in your apple for the popsicle stick to go in I'm freakin weird I know drizzle caramel on you can be like my friend and take it out of my hand and cover it in caramel there's no wrong way place it on a waxed paper sheet to just kind of let it cool down ours aren't the prettiest looking this is just white chocolate that way you melted if you're gonna make it you want to stir it every 30 to 45 seconds and then just add some sprinkles or we added some cinnamon and they just

another alcoholic slushy because as you all know it's one of my favorites I love this there's actually a recipe that I found on Facebook it's one of my friends actually posted it I shared it looked at it was like that one's good I need to try that for myself so we're gonna be making a crown royal green apple slushy oh if you checked out the original recipe I've done some modifications to it for me because I think there's some things that slightly improve it's not recipes but you know just add my little twist to it so what we're gonna do first is I'm acting as my lemonade so in the recipe they used Simms lemonade which is not bad choice at all I'm gonna be using Sunkist lemonade just because I went to the store by my job and it's the one that they're hey somehow okay this will work go Sunkist lemonade I'm gonna throw in our Crown Royal our regal Apple camera which if you've never smelled it smells really good like is this smells really good also I had no idea Crown Royal was made in Canada the more you know [Music] which about right there for the camera and we're gonna finish it off so in their recipe sees my arm for a second they use green apple Gatorade wasn't like that's cool but I think I got something a little bit better so we're gonna use green apple kool-aid good why the hell not I just thought it will give it a better color personally like inside nice green like isn't it a very very just be a hell of a st. Patty's Day drink I think sure the kool-aid wasn't in the shy it's not yes it already smells really good yeah yeah you might want to keep this recipe you know in the back pocket for say Panthers day so what we're gonna do like I do all my bourbon slushies not my purpose lassies but my alcoholic slushies I'm gonna wrap it up with plastic put it in the freezer for 24 hours then we'll finish it the next day so stay tuned wait 24 hours and I'll be right back 24 hours later all right so here's our slushy after it has been freezing overnight you can actually pull your slushy a little bit earlier if it gets to the point as you like actually could have pulled it a little bit earlier but you're not figured you know I waited out wait the full 24 hours and come back and finish it up so I just scoop my slushy out the route of my picture was just an ice cream scoop or a pretty heavy spoon because it is frozen so you don't want your spoon in the big let me show you have a pretty hefty spoon and so now I'm gonna do is I'm gonna finish it off with just a little bit more green apple kool-aid there we go so it kind of looks like a ice if you grew up with shaved ice oh no it might be some spillage but we're gonna do empty my spoon and mix it in a little bit probably a little more kool-aid so you can actually pull it earlier if you would like like if the freezes to the point did you like you're a morning welcome to freeze a little bit earlier or pull a little bit earlier a little more kool-aid it's getting a little messy but that's okay just want to loosen the up song so it's not too yeah you don't want it to be too wet but you don't want it to be to further than it's hard to drink that looks good yeah maybe a little bit more maybe just a little bit more just a little more cool eh I also gets the color okay that should be good there we go so there you go that's right looking always suggestive for yourself and your personal taste but here is our finished crown royal green apple slushie perfect for any summer day or st.

later", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please

Margie and welcome back to my kitchen what I made today was a big pot of caramel and what I did with the caramel was soft caramel I made some caramel apples and I made which we decorated with some chocolate and also we placed some data into some pecans not all of them because not everybody eats nuts and then I made some turtles with some pecans there's some chocolate on top caramel and and pecan nuts whole pecans and then with the rest of the caramel I put it into this is a 9 by 13 pan which I poured it in and it started to get harder because I way I put it in there it sort of makes it so it's a it'll be thick like a caramel and then it's almost has to cool off completely and it hasn't quite done that and then later I'm going to cut them into little squares either dip them in chocolate or not dip them in chocolate it's fine we'll wrap them in some wax paper but this video really is to show you how to do the caramel apples so we're going to get started right away let's talk about the apples first now when it comes to the apples themselves you wash them wash them well and then you're going to take out their little stems okay so just go ahead and twist them out and you want to dry them I'm going to put spore straight down to the to the bottom and just let it be right there okay and so go ahead and do that with all of your apples try to go straight down once it's in don't take it out just leave it there all right so there what I have on this tray is what you start with okay you're going to put this is one cup of melted butter one and a half cups of light corn syrup two cups of half-and-half one cup of brown sugar and one and a half cups of white sugar some of the utensils that are good to use with this is when you're stirring your caramel this has a nice flat bottom okay so you can really scrape you know the bottom of your pan to keep it from burning that's very important to have a novel so many of these because we make the English toffee and they're just perfect for that when you're all done if you can have this is always good to have if you like to make candy our utensils I can tolerate high heat but I always will take a pan with some saran wrap and you can you don't have to do this but I put some nuts down not everybody can eat nut so be careful in regard to nuts and allergies but you dip the Apple and you can place it right down on your nuts and so any caramel that flows to the bottom will pick up some nuts and that will be awesome the very last thing I want to tell you about is I'm only have six apples here but I know I'm going to have more caramel and later on when I can do with the extra caramels I can cut it up into pieces and dip that in chocolate just gives me it or it gives me another option I can also pour some on top of those pecans and make some Turtles I'll tell you that some things you can do but in the end when you have some left this is one way to save what you have left and when it cools off you can cut little squares and we're ready to get started making the caramel now this is my pot is a very heavy bottom to this pot and I have my temperature on high okay so I'm going to start with my butter I always do that because it helps I think it helps the butter candy from sticking later on if I start with melted butter I could be wrong just what I do okay so now I'm going to put the this is the corn syrup I have my temperature on high because you want to try to cook the candy as quickly as you can but in the same thing that be careful to make sure it doesn't burn so you always want to be not always be stirring it but I'll show you want to just keep an eye on the bottom so here we have our half-and-half now I'm going to put my sugars and say I've dropped right into the center I try not to get any sugar on the side of my pot okay I lost my wooden stick I got another one here don't ask me why it's burnt but so I just sort of break it up I'm not really stirring it so it gets on the side now you want to make sure that before this comes to a boil that all the sugar is dissolved now the only thing I have left is the vanilla which I'm going to save until a little later now this is starting to come to a boil right around the edge so I'm going to stir that in and you can feel on the bottom of the pot that all this sugar is melted at this point you also want to introduce your thermometer make sure that bulb is under the candy liquid now we're going to wait for this to come up to 240 and then we're going I'm going to stir it a few times not too too much for just a few times and be careful not to scrape the sides of the pot now this is starting to boil up and you're going to think it's going to boil over in this pot and you're going to get really nervous but it's not going to boil over my recipe says that you cook it to 240 and then you watch it I guess stir it I guess that's what they mean by watch it because that is important because it will start to stick to the bottom of the pan and then if it does it will burn so you really do once it gets to 240 you want to start to stir it more first so you can loosen whatever is on the bottom I don't really feel anything on the bottom you'd see it on the bottom of the spoon now this is reached 240 so I'm watching it very carefully till it gets up to 248 and I actually take it off a moment before that because I don't want them to get too hard otherwise they turn into sugar daddies okay that's done I'm going to take that out I am going to let this cool in here for a moment just let the bubbles start to come down a little bit you all right so we'll just let that sit for a moment then I'll add my vanilla and at this point I can start using this other scraper I guess it's heat tolerant now when you do add your vanilla be careful because this might splatter a little bit from the liquid so I even suggest that you use a potholder for your hand for the hand that you're going you can dump it in with one if you dump this in without the pot holder on but when you score to stir it in here that it splatters a little bit and you can go along the sides now because this was a fresh new pot there is your caramel you can do anything you want with that now see now you're just going to put your put the apple in and give it a quick turn you don't have to go to the very top of the Apple especially when they're pretty like that then you want to place it down in your nuts and it will pick up some of the nuts there not too many of them but you'll have a few little nuts on the bottom inside that caramel that flows down try a green one can't bring it all the way to the top if you want you can also let the caramel cool for a minute it looks pretty good if you don't want any nuts on your Apple you can just set it right down it's a little tiny one this is so cute now with the rest of your caramel okay but you can scrape the sides now okay because this is not the pan you cooked in but you can do is just pour this and this is a I have some parchment on the bottom you don't need that but I have saran wrap or plastic wrap you just go ahead and pour that in go ahead and pour it in scrape out your whole pan you want to lose any be careful not to let this touch is still pretty hot now to make it as thick as you want little trick I learned as well just bring because your your saran wrap is over the side here and over the side here okay bring this over and it will literally just thicken up alright bring you as far up as you want however thick you think you'd like it to be for a caramel and then just curl your saran wrap underneath and it will stay there and let that cool overnight not in the refrigerator these don't need to be refrigerated at this point when you're ready to decorate you can just melt your chocolate and I have a a little video on how to make these little paper cones okay make up a little paper : don't do it over your things okay I took them out of their little papers my suggestion really would be to when you dip your apples just to dip them and put them directly down on the saran wrap and then you can put them in the papers later so I'm just going to cut a very tiny little piece off the bottom then you can just kind of go around your Apple turn it in your hand doesn't have to be fancy or too much chocolate either I don't honestly think it needs any chocolate but this is how they do that and they'll keep putting layers of chocolate on I'm not going to put it on all of them just give it a spin around it doesn't really need a whole lot I guess that you can put as much on as you like just give it a turn your Apple and make your stripes now you want it to cool completely before you would put it into a paper you could also use milk chocolate I use dark chocolate and white chocolate now these are completely cool so you can go ahead and put them into your parchment paper to wrap the caramel apples you want to get a bag this is a solo bag that has a side to it if you can get these kind of bags at a store that's like a craft store or a store that sells candy supplies you can just go ahead and open them up all the way okay and now all you want to do is take some curly ribbon or any kind of ribbon that you like I'm going to use this shiny ribbon here I've always loved this ribbon I'm gonna cut a nice piece because I can tie your bow I want to make it as tight as you can make a bow so it's easier for somebody to get into it always I'm a firm believer in bows rather than a knot I pull my little loops really small then I can pull it tight and then you can leave your tails long and you can give them a curl so there you go you have a little caramel apple you can use more colorful ribbon if you like you can use ones for the Fall to use maroon or green and yellow and orange and red all those fun things let's see how nice this caramel apple cuts take a nice sharp knife it's a nice soft caramel looks delicious so nice and soft the caramel is well thank

[Music]", "sMmX-iQaBYs": "you're going to need to have a metal pan or a wax paper or parchment paper and you're going to need to butter the entire thing so that the apples do not stick once you place them on there next you're going to need to move to the oven and get a sauce pan and add three cups of hot water and bring that to a boil you're then going to take your granny smith apples and remove the stems and place them in the boiling water for 10 seconds so that the wax comes off of the apples i'm then taking a cloth towel you can use a towel or a paper towel and then i'm wiping all of the water off the apples so that i can dip them properly i'm going to lay all the apples that i dipped in the boiling water on a wax paper sheet so then i can let them dry as i make the caramel and then i'm going to take these bamboo sticks that i got from michaels you can use these sticks or popsicle sticks and i'm going to stick them in the middle where the stem was so that i can dip them [Music] now only to make the caramel you're going to need one cup of light brown sugar one stick or a half a cup of unsalted butter a half a cup of light corn syrup and lastly a half a can of sweetened condensed milk or seven ounces i'm going to whisk all of the ingredients i put in my saucepan until i reach a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer or any type of cooking thermometer so once the caramel reaches 245 degrees fahrenheit you can remove it from the stove [Music] [Music] do this process takes about 20 to 30 minutes depending on how high you have your heat i have my heat on medium heat and you can see that it's starting to get done and i'm just waiting for it to reach 245 caramel has now reached 245 degrees fahrenheit so now i'm going to remove it and wait one to two minutes so then i can add my vanilla extract as i wait for the caramel i'm going to wipe all of the apples again because some of them have sweated now that i waited one to two minutes i'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla extract to my caramel i'm now going to take the apples and submerge them in the caramel i do a 360 rotation all throughout so that the whole apple gets covered [Music] so i had to reheat my caramel because it got stiff if you need to do this you can place the saucepan back on the stove and on medium heat for about one to two minutes just until you reach a boil and then you can start dipping again [Music] so these are how the apples turned out i think they look really nice you can leave them like this or you can dip them in a theme like i'm doing [Music] you", "DR4Q0JHRJWo": "back in the real Halloween trick-or-treat days people actually used to make and hand out these instead of this I mean when's the last time you saw that those were the good old days and I think they're pretty much gone partially because people nowadays find it quite a trick to make this traditional fall treat well I've got some good news it's not as much of a trick as you might think hang out for a few minutes because I'm gonna show you how to make this delicious caramel apple the old-fashioned way okay there are basically two ways you can go about making caramel apples number one you can go out and buy some caramels it's the easy way and add two tablespoons of water to every pound of cut caramels and just microwave it until it's smooth and thick or if you're feeling particularly nostalgic you can do number two which is to make this decadent caramel dipping sauce from scratch just like the good old days really come on it's not that difficult and I'm going to show you how plus I had a couple of special finishing touches which make my caramel apples irresistible so let's get right to it here are the ingredients a medium sized saucepan to cook your caramel sauce a candy thermometer that reads to at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit a cookie sheet lightly sprayed with vegetable spray or a silicone non-stick baking mat or wax paper a pastry brush a couple of small bowls and last but not least some sticks for your apples and here's where you can get really creative you can either use one quarter inch wooden dowel rod cut into six inch pieces and sharpened with a pencil sharpener or craft sticks otherwise known as popsicle sticks or you could just cook some cool sticks from your neighbors tree and call it a day to make approximately three cups of caramel dipping sauce or enough to coat about eight to ten medium to small apples you're gonna need one cup of granulated sugar one cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of light clear corn syrup 1/4 cup of water one and a half cups of heavy whipping cream two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract two tablespoons of salted butter and eight to ten apples your choice but I generally recommend once you prefer eating otherwise I have here some of my favorites Fuji Kiku Honey Crisp and Granny Smith but you can also find a great list of my favorite eating apples in Nino's Apple guide which you can find on our website or in our stores begin by washing drying and inserting 6-inch wooden skewers or craft or popsicle sticks or even twigs into your apples then slightly chill all of them in the refrigerator or in a cool place now avoid chilling them to the point where they sweat when you bring them out to room temperature to make the caramel sauce place the water the corn syrup and both sugars in a medium sized saucepan stir to combine the ingredients well then wash down the sides of the pan with a brush and water then place it on your burner begin cooking the caramel sauce over medium-low heat until it comes to a gentle simmer let it simmer for about five minutes then stir in the cream the vanilla and the butter return the mixture to the burner and turn up the heat to medium and place your thermometer in the pan check it every few minutes until it registers 250 degrees Fahrenheit and then remove the entire sauce from the heat you really don't have to stir it if you don't want to okay we're at two hundred and fifty degrees right now so I'm gonna take my thermometer out and obviously this is too hot to dip apples in right now so we're gonna have to cool it down the best way to do that is I've got over in my sink some cold water and I'm gonna set the pot down into the cold water and just stir it very gently until it starts getting thicker and a little cooler and then eventually I'm gonna transfer it over into a bowl that I can dip my appleson so i'ma head over to think right now I'll join you there two to three inches of cold water is enough to do the trick here just gently stir the sauce until it becomes creamy and fudge-like and that usually takes about a minute okay I've had this cooling in the cold water bath in the sink for a couple of minutes now and it's just about the consistency I want to do my caramel apples so we're gonna put this into a deeper Bowl and that'll allow me to get the Apple right down into the caramel a lot having to roll it around too much you can see how beautifully thick this caramel sauce is so we'll just get it all in there and now what I'm gonna do is bring up my apples and start dipping let's check our apples they've been now chillin for about 15-20 minutes they're just nice and cool but they're not to refrigerate it if you know what I'm talking about they're not too cold I have my sauce that we just brought off of the range put on our little water bath in there and got nice and cool and so you're just gonna make sure they're not sweating which they are not and we're gonna dip this down almost to the stem roll it around a little bit like this check that out now it takes quite a while for the caramel sauce to run completely off so what I like to do is when I start getting a nice gathering of sauce on the bottom I wipe the bottom just like this and then turn it upside down and just kind of rotate it a bit and that'll allow the caramel sauce to evenly coat the outside of the apple at that point in time we're gonna set it down and pick up another one plunge it all the way into the sauce so maybe you can still see a little bit of the Apple on top just like this and this one while it's still soft I'm going to add one of my ingredients that I love adding and that's smoked sea salt and I have some right here it's called Falk salt we sell it at Nino's so what I'll do here just wipe this off and then right around the top just the top rim only I like to put this smoked salt and it makes your Apple taste so smoky and salty around that caramel sweetness it's a little bit like us some mores in the fall just a wonderful taste get the extra caramel sauce off and go on to my next Apple now I have one more secret that I add to my caramel apples and that's chocolate I'm gonna do that a second okay here's step two of my wickedly delicious caramel apples I did one with smoked salt and I did one without we're gonna finish these both the same way and that's with chocolate now you can buy chocolate dip which we have at Nino's it's called the Dulce fruit de and you can melt this right in this cup and it works great or you can take three ounces of chocolate morsels and add one tablespoon of vegetable oil I melt that microwave oven it'll work the same way so I have right here my fruit date Dolce and I'm going to dip it about a third of the way in chocolate so I now have the smoked sea salt I have the caramel and I have the chocolate and this hardens pretty quickly as you can see and just set it down just like that and get my other one here and dip it to right about halfway up maybe and it doesn't take long to to harden at all mmm just swipe the bottom like that and we're done so whether you like smoked salt on yours and chocolate or just caramel and chocolate just plain caramel or any other types of toppings you can imagine from nuts to cookies and ground candies of all different kinds you've got to try these caramel apples out this fall they're delicious now as I mentioned there are loads of other top things you can decorate your caramel apples with just keep in mind that you want to sprinkle or or roll them onto your caramel apples just after you dip them and before the caramel sets most important have fun hey let me know how your caramel apples turned out what apples did you use what toppings did you try I'm Pete Lauren director of culinary development at Nino's if you

"hello everyone welcome back in the kitchen my name is Victoria and today we're going to be making some caramel and chocolate covered apples we're going to need for these apples are some apples of course some white chocolate or of chocolate of your choice caramel milk chocolate pretzels and coconuts and some butterscotch you're also going to need a plate with some freezer paper so you're going to take your apples and if you have the little mini caramels you're going to want to melt them and have them in a plate and somewhere where they can where you can play at the apple thing so yeah so once you've covered all over your apples you're going to want to put them in the freezer until they're solid and the caramel it won't get installed it unless you like leave it overnight or something but it will get have a chewy like texture so time to decorate while the others are freezing I made a couple more and I'm going to take all my toppings and the caramel I'm going to drizzle that on the ones and to decorate them so I'm going to take my chocolate here and chisel aren't to the ones that don't have just you mess up everything and if you cover your pan with freezer paper you don't have to worry about not about being messy because then we'll just come right off it's really too much add some coconut on this one and on this one oh blush the apples are out for me and we'll take some pretzels and this these pretzels will give it crunchy texture then these caramel ones I'm gonna drizzle so well since they're chewing up I'm going to add some coconut of one add some pretzels so I get like a chewy crunchy so sticky then released last few I'm going to take butterscotch these are just going to be right over so once we have butterscotch and once in a half chocolate and for this big one I might just take a little bit of everything that's open water stick ok lots of people this hello these are my candy apple so feel free to just add whatever you about i just added these ingredients because they're my favorites I might add a little bit more decoration off camera like yeah so guys I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe and I hope you guys try it out don't forget to Like and subscribe and by", "bdBOzg3qPAs": "hi I'm Diane cometa and today I'm dishing with dye I'm going to show you how to make candy apples the perfect fall treat especially for Halloween so let's get started audition with dye need some apples that have been washed and dried some water some light corn syrup some white granulated sugar and some red food coloring I also have some popsicle sticks here so we can put them into our apples so we have something to hold on to and I have a candy thermometer here now if you don't have a candy thermometer don't worry I'll show you a way you can test out the temperature of the syrup when we get to that point so you also need a nice heavy pot here so this is what you're going to use to put everything in and we're going to cook this on the stove and then I have a baking sheet with a little bit of parchment paper and I sprayed it with some nonstick spray just to make it slick so that the Apple when we're done with it does not stick so what we're going to do first is take these little sticks and poke them into our apples shove that right in there it's important to wash them because sometimes in the grocery stores they have wax on the apples and that could interfere with the way the candy sticks to the Apple so make sure you get them you know washed off and then also just Pat them dry nicely now into our pot what we're going to do first is take the white granulated sugar and just dump that in along with the water and our corn syrup then you have your red food coloring now this is optional but this is what makes it red so otherwise it's just going to be a clear glaze and you'll see your Apple through it so you could do that if you want to but really it's all about the red so you got to put some of this in and you could use liquid or gel whatever you prefer I have some you know liquid here today but sometimes I use the gel and the next thing we're to do is just stir this together just combined now I'm going to take this over to the stove and I'm going to put this on medium heat and I'm going to pop my candy thermometer in so let's go clip your candy thermometer on the side of your pot and if you don't have a candy thermometer just have a little cup of cold water and a spoon and also make sure you have some paper towels handy you just want to cook this for about 15 minutes over medium heat without stirring it that's very important so what we're looking for here is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit on your candy thermometer so if you don't have a candy thermometer just set your timer for about 15 minutes and then I'll show you how to check it but remember don't stir I'm removing my candy thermometer because I'm over 300 degrees now and I just want to show you real quick what to look for if you don't have a candy thermometer just take a little bit of the candy and drop it into your cold water and you can see it formed hard thread so make sure your water is nice and cold then you see that now ready to dip our apples in tilt your pan so that all of the syrup comes to one side and then take your apple and careful don't touch your fingers on the side you don't want to get burnt and do this quickly just turn it turn it and then come up give it a little twirl and then right on to your baking sheet and just keep going until you're done with all of them my apples are all done and they cooled for about 10 minutes and now I'm going to take a little bite all my face around I love the way the Apple is nice and juicy and then this is nice and hard I'm going to tell you to be careful make sure you work really quickly because you don't want to get extra hard and extra thick because then your apples are going to come out with a super thick coating and you might have to have a dental appointment if you try to bite into it the full recipe with all the ingredients is on my website dish and with.com and don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel I have new recipes every week I look forward to seeing you next time and I hope I make your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious bye now you", "ID_y1ArCBmU": "I'll start things off with grape lollipops it's a perfect introduction to candy making so the first thing I need to do is prepare my lollipop mold you don't need to buy a fancy mold to make lollipops you can actually create your own what I have is a baking tray lined with parchment paper and I'm going to sift 2 to 3 cups of icing sugar on to the tray have a nice thick layer of icing sugar the amount you need really just depends on the size of your tray basically you want about half an inch layer of icing sugar just grab a spatula when you're spreading out your icing sugar do it loosely don't pack it down and the bigger the tray you use well the more lollipops you can fit on now that I have an even and pretty level layer I can create my lollipop shapes what you want to do is take a flat bottom glass in any shape you want and press it into the icing sugar packing it right down and take a little peak to make sure that you have clearance of about a quarter inch maybe just a little less all the way around this is where you're going to pour in your hot sugar to shape your lollipop you can find lollipop sticks at some grocery stores but definitely at stores that sell baking supplies and I press it into the icing sugar so that one end of the stick goes right into the mold there we go now I'm all set what I love about making lollipops at home is the fact that you can control the flavor and the color and you can go all natural using clear fruit juices is a great way to add flavor and color so I'm making grape lollipops by using grape juice I'm measuring out half a cup of grape juice now on its own this grape juice is too thin it won't add in a flavor or color so what I need to do is reduce it I'll put it in a small sauce pot turn up the heat on high and I want to reduce this down to about 2 tablespoons by volume this will only take a few minutes and you could use any juice you want so long as it's a clear juice that way your lollipops are nice and clear there we go my juice is reduced to now a syrup two tablespoons worth because the water has evaporated away so you're left with that concentrated flavor color and sweetness so now we're all set to start the actual lollipops first I put a quarter cup of water in the bottom of my pot that way it makes it easier for the one cup of sugar I add to immediately start dissolving you want to liquefy that sugar pretty quickly and then typical to a lot of candy making corn syrup white corn syrup is a common ingredient that really gets the clarity and the set to your candy making so I'm adding a quarter cup I'll set my heat to high which is how you cook all of your sugar when your candy making and that sugar boils and it boils beyond 212 Fahrenheit you want to cook it all the way to 300 degrees Fahrenheit that's called hard crack in the candy making world and it's before it turns to caramel but yet it sets up so that your lollipops have a nice crunch using a thermometer is important in candy making that's how you know you've hit your temperatures precisely but as the sugar starts melting and coming to a boil and throughout the process I occasionally take a brush dipped in cool water and just brush the sides of the pot this ensures that any sugar that might boil up and hit the side of the pot doesn't then cool down and crystallize give this a little check I'm at 235 the goal is 300 I can tell I'm getting close because the bubbling of the sugar is starting to slow because the sugar itself is thickening up there we go once your sugar hits the 300 degrees take it off the heat and then you want to add that concentrated grape syrup and give it a quick stir in immediately it adds that gorgeous purple color and I can smell the grape now you take your ladle and pour in to each mold make sure you're covering that lollipop stick if you find your sugar is starting to set up on you you can always put it back on the stove on low heat to remelt the sugar and this is where you can get creative with your decorations you could add sprinkles a few draws a is like I'm adding finished with a few more small ways once you're finished with your lollipops you want to give them 15 to 20 minutes to set up then it's time to take them out of the icing sugar they will have icing sugar on them from the mold so first I take a little brush to brush them off and take a lightly moistened cloth or paper towel and just wipe off the icing sugar and then I dry it off and there you can actually see right through it once they're cleaned up and have had a chance to air dry a little bit then you can pack them up in little sello bags for gifting or just store them in an airtight container until you need them I bet you never guessed that making lollipops was actually so easy an all-natural to love that nice grape flavor it just looks so sweet", "l1ne4lUvG1o": "what's up there you too welcome to another episode of mystery man reviews now today we're gonna review a couple of things we're going to review the rocky series you know with all Sylvester Stallone yo Adrian and we're gonna review the caramel apple pie now I'm not that big on candy but I'm gonna give it a try so on the outside it looks like caramel me it's supposed to be caramel and then green apple let's give it a shot you can definitely taste the caramel Oh Rocky now I don't know how many of y'all have seen all the movies but the first one is pretty boy and the variant he fights Apollo Creed and he loses it but still and and then the follow set angle be no rematch but then when they got to the hospital he said would anyplace anytime punk rocky said but yo Apollo I thought you said the one gonna be no rematch and so that's why there was a rocky - now rocky - this is oh this is this is like beta VHS I don't know what it is but you can see rocky looked pretty stupid back but in rocky 2 he fought Apollo Creed and that was a good movie the only problem was about halfway through the movie mmm it's just like caramel mm-hmm but anyway about halfway through the movie Adrian has their baby and she goes into a coma in that's real boring for about 15-20 minutes you know so in my opinion is a great movie except for that 15 or 20 minutes and if you can get past that you will enjoy that movie that did rocky 3 with Winnie if he fought against mr. t and then he beat mr. t up and mr. t win joined a team let's see after that was rocky for now rocky 4 was when he fought that big Russian and you know he had to go over to Russia and find him over there and that was a good movie too so I'd say it's a thumbs up for rocky rocky 1 is okay rocky 2 good rockin 3 he's good rocky 4 was good but rocky 5 that was with Tommy Morrison and that wasn't too good rocky 6 nah I wasn't no good neither and then created that now but rocky 2 3 4 was good now back to this I see how fast I can eat this [Music] I need to get to the cinema with Apple Ponte [Music] I just bit into it it takes just like green apple on the inside I would give this a thumbs up I don't want to thank you guys and

tell you what so do we Anna Kennison went the sweet and salty roof recommending crushed pretzels crushed Oreos our friend Jenn Holloman made this suggestion saying she wanted to be here when we did the taste testing sorry den I have a feeling you're enjoying the day off anyway looking for a healthier option Melissa Lawson says go for slightly sweetened oats or granola sounds pretty good to me Melissa says it adds a little extra crunch and finally Jamie Murphy was the first to suggest s'mores it was actually a couple of people's favorite apparently combining two delicious desserts into one is a big hit once my muffin tins were filled up I sliced my Apple next I grabbed some lollipop sticks you can find these at a craft store and place them into each apple slice dip your slice into either melted caramel or melted chocolate your choice cover it in your favorite topping and enjoy the best part about this is you can enjoy many different kinds of candy apples in just one sitting or if you don't want a whole apple make it a small snack remember all of the instructions to this easy snack are on 9news.com / fix this", "u1OHqpmLlrY": "this is not a secret recipe I'm just using the recipe on the back of these Kraft caramel or caramel dipped apples the first thing we're gonna do to make our caramel apples is remove the stems so twist them there might be a better way my usual just twist them and take them out of all of your apples after you remove all of the stems from your apples you want to rinse them off in hot water to get rid of the waxy coating that makes apples so shiny because that'll make it hard for the caramel to stick then dry them off with a paper towel stick a popsicle stick right into the middle this is the hard part for me and set him on a plate and we'll put them in the fridge to get cool while we make the caramel before we make the caramel sauce is some wax paper put your wax paper down on something that you can move around so you can carry your apples around and put them in the fridge and then cover it with some butter covering the wax paper with butter will keep your caramel apples from sticking to it if you're making it with a group of people for a party you know you can cut pieces of wax paper and then put the butter on those pieces that you've cut out this is what we're gonna put our caramel apples on to dry and while we decorate them she says that one bag of these will is enough for five apples and then making ten I'm just doubling this now the great unwrapping begins start unwrapping your caramels and putting them into your top that part takes forever so the next we need to add our water so for each package we need two tablespoons of water and since I used two packages I need what's two plus two four so we put them in a large saucepan now we're gonna cook them on medium-low heat until the caramels are melted completely and we stir it consistently which means we keep stirring it I think we need to do this part fairly quickly take your spoon out grab one of your apples and we're gonna swirl it you want to just kind of let it drip off I think I need to keep this warm actually I put my caramel back on the heat just for a minute this looks a little thick to me my first caramel apple you're just gonna try to do one big swirl and lift it out you could also use this spoon to wipe off some on the bottom carnivals getting a little bit thick so I just added a tiny bit of water and heated it up a little bit you", "O3qD2N2fqPg": "hi everyone today I will be showing you all how I make my homemade caramel apples I hope that you all enjoy please thumbs up and let's begin so here are my apples I've allowed them to sit in hot water for a few minutes you can also put them in boiling water for about 30 seconds it might change the color of the apple just slightly but that's okay this is basically just to remove any wax or residue that the Apple might have because this is a lot of the reason why a lot of people can get their caramel to stick and it's because they don't clean them properly so we're going to go ahead and vigorously wipe it down really good because sometimes they have wax on them and that will not allow the caramel to stick to the apple once we're done with this we'll move on to the next step and as you can see I do spend quite a bit of time really getting in there and removing any of the wax or residue that Apple might have all right so next I'm going to place my apples in the freezer for about one hour I like them to get nice and cold so that when the hot caramel hits them it gets cooled quickly and it doesn't you know just melt off like I said it the hot water might change the color of the apples slightly but that's fine it doesn't change the taste or anything alright everybody so I'm going to show you how I blend to my peanuts and I'm just taking this brand here from Walmart and I'm taking unsalted peanuts you can find them in various stores a lot of times you won't find them unsalted I just prefer it because I don't like salt so much salt in the apples themselves then I'm going to go ahead and take my blender and then chop and grind so as you can see it does grind them a little more than I would like but I'm not going to sit there and try to cut all these by hand so I'm just going to remove the little blade and then just dump it in a bowl and we'll use this later and I also have another mixture over here with pecans and with the peanuts because I think that's delicious I'm you can use any toppings that you like I'm just going to go with the classics and stick with these for today but you can at chocalate Eminem's all different kinds of goodies alright so I'm going to be using a stainless steel pot but if this is your first time I would definitely stick with a nonstick just so nothing sticks to it but I've pretty much you know experienced with this recipe so I'm using my stainless steel one cup of butter and we're also going to put one cup of light corn syrup I did have a cup of light and half a cup of dark now we'll just go ahead and throw that in there and then I want to take two cups of light brown sugar and this is the organic one take one can of the condensed sweetened milk and I really love this brand lolly cheetah it's just it just has a really delicious flavour to it and then we're just going to pour all of that in there and now that that's done we're going to go ahead and let it heat up how do you guys like my spatula it says mr. right on one side and then miss is always right on the other isn't that cute I love it so right now we are in a medium-high heat you can start off with a medium heat just so that um you keep it on a low and it doesn't burn out burn on you but you have to constantly be babysitting this so you have to constantly be stirring it so it doesn't burn at the bottom because it will easily burn at the bottom if you do not stir it throughout the whole process so you also want to get a candy thermometer but I would definitely not use of meat thermometer or anyth any other kind of thermometer because you can really burn yourself candy when hot or sugar when hot can really really hurt and that's happened to me it even got me goosebumps right now just thinking of it I'm going to go ahead and just continue stirring this up and I do this throughout the whole process everything just dissolved so now we're just going to let it build up the heat boil and you don't want to under boil because then it'll be too soft and you don't want to over boil because then it can be too hard so you want to make sure that you're right at 200 and 45 degree because that's actually a really good temperature to have for the apples it's beginning to boil now and I just have to say be careful because if this if you get burned this will really hurt so just be very cautious and continue on stirring because it will burn very easily at the bottom especially if you're using stainless steel so just make sure you're constantly stirring and stirring and stirring and you would definitely want to have a very deep pot because once this is nothing once it starts boiling even more it's going to rise so just make sure you have a really nice deep pot that you can work with all right so once you reach you 245\u00b0 go ahead and turn it off continue stirring so it does not stick at the bottom I don't let Bubba's near this at all when I'm cooking caramel because it can easily kind of like jump at you and it burns so definitely don't have your kids involved in this part of it you can definitely have them a part of the decorating of apples which is a lot funner but yeah Bubba's is a mile away right now watching Minecraft videos we're gonna let this cool down just a little before we go ahead and add the vanilla now that it's cooled down a bit I mean it's still bubbling but it's not anywhere near where it was a earlier I'm going to go ahead and add two teaspoons of vanilla 1/2 even if you like like almond oil I've done them with a little bit of almond oil as well and you know it's just based on liking you can do whatever you like then go ahead and just mix this up really well I'm still going to allow this to cool down just a couple more minutes and then I'm going to grab my frozen apples ah while this cools down and then we'll dip them and then we'll add the peanuts and all the good stuff alright everybody so here's my Apple and I basically just put these apple sticks right in there I got these from Walmart you can find them in the baking goods area and it's nice and frozen really cold I have my caramel and I also have some parchment paper I put it right with my baking pan and then I lightly greased it with some butters so there are my ingredients let's get started so I'm going to take my apple and I'm just going to go ahead and dip it right into the caramel make sure your pans not too hot and then just dip it I like to take it all the way up to the stick and then just allow it to remove the excess on its own you don't want to overdo it with hitting it or making it lose some of the caramel if it doesn't want to just because then it'll be too thin and just wipe it right off just like that and then while it's still hot go ahead and grab your ingredients and then dip the Apple into those ingredients if you wait too long they won't stick because apples frozen so you have to remember that it'll pull off really fast they're not sticking all of a sudden so you have to be a little quick with this so I'm going to use one more angle for you guys I basically just dip it you kind of have to work fast if the caramel starts getting cooled down on you you can simply heat it up again and it'll work with you you kind of have to work fast because once the caramel cools down the peanuts don't stick so you're going to go ahead and work a little fast here perfect then I basically just press on it just let the peanuts stick nicely on them and if you missed any spots just go back in with your hand and apply them just press down on them but not too hard otherwise the peanuts will sink into the caramel and that's not always very visually pretty so it'll be just as tasty though it just piss visually pretty so there we go nicely covered and then I just pressed down on it and then I just give it a tap just so it removes any excess and put it on parchment paper stick it in the fridge for about 15 minutes and then they're good to go so if you have any left over caramel you can always just grab your parchment paper I lightly greased it with a little bit of butter once your candy is cooled down and you can actually you know pour it on and and put it and fold it and put it in parchment paper you can actually just go ahead and store this and use it in various things like cakes even at the Lich's cake that I baked it was I used caramel that I had used previously to make some apples and look at how good that is you can even make it thick enough by increasing the temperature and that way it's like a hard caramel candy it's oh so good and it serves as a great gift also so I definitely keep these in the freezer for a while until I need them and they always come in handy all right family so here we have our apples as you can see they turned out amazing they are so yummy I had a slice already it is so good and I hope that you guys enjoyed this video found it helpful if you did please click like let me know what you want to see next and I'll see you guys tomorrow take care everyone bye", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "GU6TsY-A94o": "hey guys just for sweets here today we have something really really fun to do fall is in the air I know it's starting to get a little bit cooler here and the smell of pumpkin pie and kids at your door would saying trick-or-treat is just around the corner and we've been doing some fun things on the channel with the holidays coming up so I wanted to do something that I discovered and I thought it would be fun to share with you and who doesn't like caramel apples or candy apples they're so yummy but sometimes really really hard to eat because they're large and your kids go to take a bite and they fall off the stick or or whatever so we're gonna we have a solution to that we're doing caramel apple and candied apple slices or chunks instead and it makes it easier and then though you guaranteed to eat it all instead of wasting half an apple and so these are really fun for a party and you can do this with your kids and their friends and give them sprinkles and candy and everything to put on them and just have a really good time with it so you're gonna need apples and either cookie sticks or lollipop sticks because these aren't as heavy as a traditional apple and I have some melted caramel I melted it in the microwave and you can use either the terminal bits that you get in your baking aisle these are much easier because you don't have to unwrap them or you can get your traditional caramel candies that you have to unwrap each and every one however when you heat this up in the microwave you want to add a tablespoon of water per 5 or 6 ounces of caramel so one whole bag of caramel bits would be 2 tablespoons of water you're gonna want to heat it on 30-second intervals stirring between each one because you don't want to overdo it if you do it on the stovetop same thing just keep stirring until your caramel is melted the other thing I chose to do today is peanut butter chips and I melted those down just like with the cake pops you know the peanut butter chips and a little bit of shortening in the microwave 30-second intervals stirring between each one and peanut butter and apples so good together I thought that was a great idea and then I have a bunch of my decorations I have some orange sprinkles bless you I've got some Halloween decorations and then I also found these at Trader Joe's and their grinders and one is cinnamon sugar and the other one is sugar chocolate and coffee bean and I thought those would be really good on it and your dessert or ice cream section you can get these dessert Stoppers if you want to put those on anything you want the options are endless you can find so much right now it is unreal so what we are gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and get started and going out of the way so you want to come to the Apple and you don't want to hit the center so we're gonna come right outside the center and cut this and actually right before I want to cut that back off I'm trying to get that rounded piece off and so you take that off okay I'm going to do it on both sides first take that rounded section off and then cut your fly okay and like you've seen in my past videos we waste nothing so we're gonna take the sides of the Apple all the way down to the core and those will be Apple chunks as well for somebody who doesn't like you know so much just a little taste so we have those two and then we have the little decides now if you don't want to use your sides take them and give them to your kids for our snacks in their lunch or whatever I am going to do this fat side down then you'll see why pretty soon but I'm going to go ahead and stick those in there and just kind of stick that in each apple and I want the fat side down of the Apple let's stick them in be careful you don't want to come through all the way and then on these just kind of go in whatever side you want whatever side works best okay you're gonna want to stick these in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes I want to get them nice and nice and cold now I've already done that so these are gonna go to the side and I'm gonna get my other ones out of the freezer that we've already done and these have been chilling for about 25 minutes so they're nice and cold okay I've got our chocolate and our caramel all melted we're gonna get started I'm gonna start with one of my small ones here and you're just gonna kind of take this and twirl it in just like all the other fun things we've shown on my channel make sure to go back and check some of those out I have Halloween pretzels go switch fingers we've got pumpkin cake pops all kinds of things so make sure you check them out okay so you're gonna take that peanut butter and you're just gonna go around the Apple and then just keep getting that excess off all right there we go they don't have to look perfect what I'm gonna do with this one is I think this one I'm gonna add some of my candy topper which is just the chocolate chips and peanut butter chips and open those up and have them pre ready and kind of just go around your Apple okay and I have my cake pop holder here now like I've told you in past videos you can use styrofoam you don't have to use a cake pop holder I did find this online so if you want to find one of those you can but a piece of block of styrofoam works just as well so we have that on there this one I'm going to dip in the caramel and hopefully my caramel is hot enough I just heated it up again so kind of twirl around whoop wanna make sure it gets on there okay the caramel does not have to be perfect probably needs to be heated up for another few seconds here but because it's been sitting waiting for me to get ready okay so take that caramel and rip it off okay now you can choose to put a topper on this one if you want to you can leave it plain I am actually going to take this one and these you can put there as well but sometimes the kernel takes a little bit longer to melt and I'm sorry not melt set and so you might want to just put it on parchment paper and just I think my caramel needs will be a little a bit hotter but I'm gonna kind of just stick a few little sprinkles and stick my hand on it so make sure your caramel is warm enough because these aren't sticking because I didn't have it warm enough all right so I'm going to stick that on the parchment paper I'm going to heat this up for a second while we do our other one okay now I'm gonna do another peanut butter apple and we're gonna do it with this one go ahead and stick it in there now you could also use chocolate you could use whatever you want but I have out my chocolate my peanut butter chips and my caramel but get creative have like a little setup for your kids and if you're having a sleepover or whatever have them have like a a candied apple bar you know with all the sprinkles and all the chocolates you could have a white chocolate dark chocolate candy bars whatever you want and put a little bar out and let them make their own which is really fun for a Halloween birthday party or anything like that just a good fun thing to do okay now this one I'm gonna kind of wipe that peanut butter off a little bit in the back I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do it's drying quickly so I gotta do this fast I'm gonna cover this one in orange sprinkles and kind of stir those around if they get on the apples it's not gonna hurt them so don't worry about it okay however this this cutie up in orange sprinkles now you can have a bowl underneath you to catch some of those so you don't waste them I'm just doing this quickly okay so kind of press those in alright and we're gonna let that dry some of them fall off not a big deal and you can do the whole thing or you can do just the front I'm doing just the front I'm gonna let that go our caramel is all done so I'm going to grab that really fast now if you're doing this alone you're probably gonna have to do one at a time just because you know the stuff start setting up really fast and the last thing you want is for it to set up and you don't be able to decorate it the way you want to I'm actually gonna spoon this on this is the knife I was stirring it with a spoon would work much better but this is what I'm doing and then I can kind of control where it goes caramel apples are messy they don't have to be perfect they're just for fun these would also be really great if you were having a harvest party at your school and you wanted to do a bake sale this would be a really great addition for the bake sale they'd probably go like hotcakes because people love caramel apples and then you get the caramel apple pieces sell them for $2 each and you've got a very successful bake sale okay so let's get that on there what's that flatten out a little bit with this one remember the caramel apples dry on the wax paper nice send the mini treat to my caramel apple so now but the caramel apples there we go we'll just grind up that cinnamon and sugar right on top plain but delicious you can take this actually you know what I'm gonna add both of mine so don't have that sugar coffee chocolate wind chill you want to just kind of press that in there cuz it's starting to dry okay so with the caramel and apple pieces you want to stick these in the refrigerator for an hour let them set up you can cut that excess caramel off those it doesn't have to stay on there if you want to make it a little prettier put these in a cellophane bag tie some ribbon around them and you've got a great beautiful treat for a bake sale or a gift for somebody your peanut butter ones those set up pretty quickly you can stick those in the fridge for five minutes and they'll be ready to bag up but make sure you put these in the fridge or freezer for at least thirty minutes so I'm gonna move these to the side I'm gonna show you a little trick here with what I did with this one this is why I did the fat side down we are going to make a pumpkin here out of our little guy so we did the orange whoo that was him hot chocolate and not in a good way all right so we're gonna draw a face on our caramel apple and I'm just using a toothpick you don't have to use anything special there's one eye of our cute little pumpkin another eye I'm actually going to take this to work today and give it to somebody as a gift just because I meet them and they're fun if my kids don't steal them from me first you never know it might not even make it out the door okay so we've got the eyes and we're going to do a nose I love to do this stuff and take it to people just makes me happy it's my fun with food time again okay the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to make his little mouth and he's gonna be a happy little jack-o'-lantern you can make a scary one if you want to I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna make him happy so he's smiling all right we can even make them a little girlish if we want to and add a little eyebrow to him you know I do work in a beauty salon although this one makes them kind of look angry but that's okay we can have an angry jack-o'-lantern every month okay so put that chocolate to the side put him in here to dry and last but not least we are going to add a stem to him that means somebody got ahold of them for a snack but I'm gonna actually use these Apple snack sticks for the stem since I can't find my pretzels but a pretzel would work just fine if you go back to watch my pumpkin cake puppy video I show you how to use a pretzel on the top try doing that if you want to and that could be fun but we're going to use just an apple stick here and I got these at Trader Joe's along with everything else and I'm gonna dip it into my peanut butter because that is the flavor of this Apple and we're going to take that stem and we're just gonna put him right on top and this peanut butter sets fairly quickly you just want to make sure you have a nice coating of it and stick that peanut butter on there and you're gonna leave it alone and you're gonna let it set if you want to figure out using fruit roll-ups or whatever to make leaves you can do that as well but this is just something really fun and fabulous and great for a party so I hope you had fun with this remember get chocolate get all different kinds of toppings make yourself a caramel apple bar you can buy the caramel bits in the baking section mix a little bit of water heat it up and you've got fun fun little things for your your kids to enjoy my caramel apples have to set up so I cannot take those off wrap these in cellophane I have a good time with them

let it bake mm-hmm I'm Oh be right back", "vxDsf_KMnxg": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we are making our own candy lollipops, spirals, candy with a pattern on the inside\nand sherbet filled candies. What you'll need to make these is some sugar,\nglucose syrup, water and some cream of tartar. Put the sugar and the water into the pan with\nthe glucose syrup. Place that over high heat. If you've got any sugar crystals on the sides\nof your pan then you just want to wash those down using a wet pastry brush. Turn your oven on to 100C or 210F and place\na tray lined with non-stick baking paper in to warm up. Let your sugar mixture boil until it reaches\n150C or 302F. Turn off the heat and stir through the cream\nof tartar. Now we will follow this same basic process\nfor all of our candies. For the sherbet filled candy add yellow food\ncolouring and stir it through. And then pour that into a warm tray that has\nbeen lined with baking paper. Now to protect our hands from the heat we\nare going to use .. silicone gloves but these are not going to be enough so we are also\ngoing to use cotton gloves underneath them. Oh, and let me show you my nails while we\nare here - these are one of the designs in my own line of wraps that I'm doing with Jamberry. These ones are called YUM and they have cute\nlittle icecreams on them and I'll link to them below. For those of you who asked last week what\nare wraps? They are bit like stickers made out of nail\npolish, and you use a little bit of heat to stick them onto your nails. And they last up to few weeks. We are going to put these ones through some\nrough treatment today with heat and gloves and in and out of gloves. Fold in the edges towards of the hot sugar\ntowards the centre and then lift it up and begin to pull it out and then fold it back\nin. The more you pull it, the more shiny and opaque\nit becomes. If you want it to be transparent then don't\npull it much at all. Place it back in the tray and flatten it out\nas much as you can and then put it in the oven to warm up again. Now that it's warm you can stretch it into\na rectangle. Now usually when chefs make this sort of candy\nthey have a heat lamp shining on the candy that keeps it warm while it's on the counter\nso you don't need to keep putting it back in the oven, but they are super expensive\nso this is the way to do it home. Place a generous amount of sherbet down the\ncentre of your rectangle and then bring the sides up and around to cover it. Push down each of the ends to seal in the\nsherbet. Squeeze it to make a cylinder shape and then\nplace it back in the oven for about 30 seconds to a minute, just keeping an eye on it because\nyou don't want to overheat it. Once you can just stretch it when it's soft\nenough to stretch, pull the candy to make a long snake. Working quickly before it hardens make firm\nindents along the candy so that you are sealing in the sherbet into each one. To make lollipops we'll need a few different\ncolours in the one batch. So place strips of foil along the tray and\nthen cover it in baking paper. Prepare the candy just like we did before\nbut this time add a few drops of essence, I am using a fairy floss flavour. You can buy all different ones and then just\nflavour your candy. Pour some hot mixture into each of the sections. And then to get you pan clean all you need\nto do is fill it up with water and leave it to soak and the sugar will just dissolve off. Add food colouring to each section in the\ncolours that you are after for your lollipop. And then using scissors, cut along the baking\npaper so you can work with one colour at a time. Fold it into the middle and then stretch it\nuntil it becomes opaque. Make it into a snake and then set it aside. Repeat that with the blue. And the red\nAnd the yellow and the clear one as well to make it white Then warm them slightly again in the oven\nand place them together to make a cylinder and squeeze them so that they stick together. Cut the cylinder in half and leave some to\nkeep warm while you stretch the other half. Twisting as you stretch so you get that pretty\npattern. Take a lollipop stick and poke it into one\nend then wrap the mixture around and around pressing it into place. And you can keep going to make your lollipop\nas giant as you want it to be. To make the spirals remove the mixture from\nthe heat and add in flavouring, for this one I am using musk. Split it into two sections and add red colouring\nto one half and blue into the other. We are going to take the blue half and pull\nit and stretch it to make it opaque but with the red half we are just going to leave that\nand not pull it all. Keep pulling the blue half and twisting it\nso that you can see there the more we pull it and the more we twist it the more opaque\nand shiny it becomes. Don't pull the red half just cut it in half\nto make two long cylinders. Pull the blue into two long snakes too and\nthen stack them up to make a square. It looks a bit like toothpaste. Squeeze them together to round it out and\nthen cut that into two. Working with one half pull it and make it\nthinner into a nice thin long stick. And you can slice it while ti is warm to make\nindividual candies OR to make the spirals, wrap it around a thick skewer. Once it is all the way to the end you can\njust pull the skewer out and leave those to cool. See how the pink there is totally transparent\nbecause we didn't pull it and the blue is opaque. The other thing you can do is roll some of\nthis mixture into a ball and make round lollipops and just put a stick in one end. And you can make as many different candies\nas you like just by flavouring and colouring each one differently. And now for something which is going to be\nhard to do without a heat lamp but I reckon we can do it. We're going to split the mixture into three\nand colour some red, leave some plain and colour the last section green. Pull each of the colours just like we have\ndone before to make them opaque. And then stretch the red one to make three\nlong snakes, return one to the oven to warm up. And once it is soft and pliable, place it\nacross the top of the two red snakes and shape it at the top into a point. Add some white along each side of that triangle\nand then flip it up the other way and add a strip down the centre on the top. And then finally add more white so that the\nred is completely covered. Warm your green, and stretch it out and add\nit over the top of the white so that it goes all the way around. Now you are going to need to place that back\nin the oven to warm it up because those two red ones are quite cold by now. And once it's warm you can just stretch that\ncandy out into a long strip. Now to cut it without it shattering it needs\nto be quite warm so return it to the oven until you can bend it like this. And then quickly using a sharp knife, chop\noff pieces to reveal the little heart inside.

Make it a great week and I'll see you on Friday.", "LAVGp6FMHEw": "yay it's almost Halloween one of my favorite holidays whenever I think of Halloween treats I think of caramel apples but what's better than just caramel caramel and chocolate so I'm going to teach you how to make caramel and chocolate apple Love Bites so I bought these apples at my local farmers market they're called baby Fuji apples you can see they're so tiny cute they actually make smaller apples in these and I've tried it it works just as well this recipe but I suggest not getting crab apples crab bubbles are the most common small apple but get something more like a Wixon or a cider apple it'll be a little bit sweeter so if you buy your apples at your grocery store that's totally fine but they normally come with some wax on them so what you're not have to do before is soak them in hot water for about a minute and take a towel and scrub them really hard you really want to make sure you get all that wax off because if you dip it in the caramel it'll just it won't stick it'll drip off and streak and nobody wants that when I see some caramel apples they're normally pierced on the top and I just don't really like that I like to pierce it at the bottom so when you're holding it you see the nice Apple facing the way it should be I'm going to take my stick and pierce it at the bottom about halfway down I use this bigger stick but you can find smaller ones it's just up to you all preference make sure you wash your apples and take off all the stems and just keep going of all your apples so there's a couple tips you want to remember when tempering or melting your chocolate the first step is the bowl that you use cannot have any water in it if any water gets into the chocolate it will freeze up and Harden you will not be able to use it you have to start all over again nobody likes that the second step is you want to make sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water that's in the saucepan for some reason it just makes it too hot and never works you also want to add about two thirds of your chocolate and keep the other third we're going to add that a little bit later so start your chocolate put a saucepan on low heat on the stove just wait a few minutes that will melt and then once it's about 3/4 of the way melted add the rest of your chocolate and that will help pull it down and give it a more smooth consistency I'm going to keep the chocolate tempering on the back burner still on low while I work on my caramel my suggestion is to make sure you measure out all your ingredients and put them right by your pot so that you have caramel can look really quickly so you just want to make sure you're prepared so I normally add the vanilla extract and the salt to the heavy cream just so it's easier to dump in one step so I'm going to turn on the flame to medium high heat I'm going to add my sugar I'm going to measure out my corn syrup all the measurements are in the description below I'm going to add in my butter and then I'm going to add 3/4 of my heavy cream and keep a quarter on the side for hour later give it a quick stir and then don't put any tencel's in the pot after that while we're waiting for the caramel it's time to add the rest of our chocolate repeat these steps if you'd like to use multiple chocolate caramel is going to bubble up and turn into a golden brown once that happens turn it off the heat add the remainder of your cream and give it a nice whisk you want to let this cool until it's thick enough to coat a spoon while our Co mole is cooling we're going to put some wax paper on a baking sheet and give it a nice coating of butter this will make sure that your apples won't stick now I'm going to dip the apples in the caramel make sure you get a nice coating on your apple and shake off the excess and then scrape off the bottom on the side of your saucepan let your apples cool for about 10 minutes and then use your spatula to mold the caramel to the bottom part of your Apple for your toppings pick some your favorite nuts I picked walnuts and almonds it will see you some of the chocolate bars you have lying around for trick or treaters just stick them in the fridge before you cut them so I like to use a large soup spoon to coat the chocolate evenly on the Apple how nicely it just coats it sure you get the top - just take a big heat fold the chocolate and roll my Apple in the spoon so you want to mix it up a little bit feel free to add the nuts first and then chocolate over it like so so take your rubber spatula take a nice big clump amount and chocolate and just give it a long straight up and down you can add the chocolate to a piping bag and do it that way if you want or even a ziplock bag and cut the corner but I find that this way is just as easy now when you dip some white chocolate on it and add some streaks drizzle it so nice how delicious does that look well there you have it don't they look amazing for the perfect way to impress your guests without leaving them overstuffed make sure to try this recipe for your friends and family and also subscribe below thanks my lovely uns bye", "BYajjMMwNsY": "yo yo yo what's good everybody bass drop keys your philly neighborhood negro in today's video guys i'm going to show you how to make a classic treat today we're going to be doing candy apples let's go ahead and get into it let's do way all right guys so welcome back to another great goodies 420 video before we get this video going i do gotta let you know this video is being sponsored by magicalbutter.com use base drop keys to get 20 off your order with magicalbutter.com i want to thank them for sponsoring me in general but also sponsoring today's video based drug keys magicalbutter.com 20 off all right guys so today's video we got a classic for you we're going to be doing candy apples where i'm from in georgia every october or november we have the country fair come through i remember going to the country fair i used to always love to get me a funnel cake and a candy apple in today's video we're going to show you exactly how to make candy apples and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it this right here is how you make candy apples here we go all right guys so first things first is i'm going to tell you about the preparation as you can see here we have the apples here with our popsicle sticks in it you can use popsicle sticks or skewers whatever you want to use is fine also i have a piece of parchment paper right here that we're going to be using once we dip our apples into the candy we're going to need to place them somewhere so that it can dry and we're going to do it right here before we place the apples on the parchment paper we are going to spray it with some nonstick coconut spray here you can use whatever spray that you want to use but we're going to use this nonstick coconut spray before we place the candied apples on the parchment paper just to make sure that they don't stick as far as the apples go the preparation for those i wash those with hot water because you don't want to have any of the wax on there and then make sure that you dry them and then you also want to take off the stem and then put the sticks in there so the main thing is use hot water to get any of the wax that's on there sometimes you know your apples and your fruit will have that wax coating on there to get that off all you want to do is use hot water dry them off make sure they're really dry stick the popsicle sticks in there or skewers and then you're ready to go also guys what we're going to be using is some of this candy flavor right here this is the cotton candy flavor we're going to be using the drama this this is totally optional you don't have to use this but it does give you a nice flavor so whenever you see me put the tincture in there i'm also going to be putting this cotton candy flavor in there as well once again not 100 necessary but i do like it because it's going to give a nice flavor to your candy other than the flavor from the sugar you're going to have this nice flavor as well okay now let's go ahead and get to making our candy apples that's the last thing that we got to do is we got to go ahead and make them here we go all right guys so we're going to start making our candy apples now we're going to start off by putting two cups of sugar inside of our saucepan you can see that we have that here already to this we're going to add a half cup of corn syrup [Music] and we're not going to be stirring this up so don't stir this up okay we're going to add 3 4 cup of water we're going to add a quarter teaspoon of red food coloring and finally i have my candy thermometer right there we have everything in here that we need right now and so we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and turn on our saucepan to medium high heat if you have a 1 to 10 dial i'm gonna go ahead and put it on number eight and so for the most part that's basically it like i was saying before we're not going to stir this up at all all we're going to do now is we have the dial on number eight we're gonna let this warm up and we're gonna actually warm this up until it gets 280 degrees on our candy thermometer 280 degrees fahrenheit on our candidate thermometer so as i just told you we put our dial on the number eight setting on the dial here we're going to let this warm up until it gets to 280 degrees fahrenheit on our candy thermometer not celsius 280 degrees fahrenheit almost 150 celsius on there and once that happens we're going to put in our tincture and we're going to put in our dram of flavoring and then we're going to get to the dipping so i'm going to show you what it looks like whenever we reach the 280 degrees fahrenheit give me a couple minutes and i'll show it to you in just a second all right guys so as you can see we're starting to have some action inside of our saucepan here we still have to let it get to the right temperature which is 280 degrees fahrenheit so that way it would actually you know harden up in candy the way we want to while we're doing this i want to go ahead and talk about the dosage of this i'm using that one gram of flavoring like i told you before and we're using two teaspoons of tincture for the tincture that i have that you guys see me made we just recently made it on the channel that's going to be 85 milligrams of thc because we're doing three apples right here when we finished doing these apples each apple will be about 20 28 and a half milligrams of thc so that's our edible dosage right there each apple is going to be about 28 and a half milligrams of thc we're going to continue to let this go here and uh yeah once it reaches the right temperature i'll show you what it looks like all right guys so we're approaching 240 240 degrees on our candy thermometer i'm going to go ahead and add in our tincture and our dram of flavor that we talked about earlier let me go and add this in all right guys so real quickly here i want to apologize to you guys once again i did something stupid and i deleted the clip where i actually i mean the best part of the video where i actually you know the the candy mixture right here comes the temperature and then you see me actually dip the candy apples and because i had some extra candy mixture i grabbed some grapes and actually dipped them too so because i'm stupid and i keep making mistakes like i spent all this time energy and money upgrading the equipment upgrading everything that i'm doing but in the end if you make dumb mistakes then you pay the price so i'm sorry but uh what you just missed that i deleted was it just came to temperature you see me take the apple and what you want to do is you just want to tilt the pot over to the side you put the apple in it and you just rotate it around and it will coat it you set it to the side on the parchment paper don't forget that you need to spray the parchment paper with some nonstick spray to make sure that it doesn't stick on there i did some grapes and i did some apples once again sorry that i deleted it i keep making these dumb mistakes i'll try to do better in the future sorry all right guys so i just showed you how to make candy apples i hope that this video helped you out

Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "rJ0zupx9HJk": "let's see what it's time for yo-yo faced 12 hello everyone today we're making a recipe that has been requested a couple of times this is a traditional fall treat candied apples and people have been making these for years and years so we're medium heat place one and a half cups of sugar one cup of light corn syrup and one cup of water then stir this over high heat and continue to stir until it starts to boil and the sugar is dissolved and once it's boiling you can stop stirring and you need to heat this over high heat until the sugar syrup reaches 285 degrees Fahrenheit which is the soft crack stage and you can use a candy thermometer this would be the easiest method but there is another method of telling you reach the soft crack stage I'll put that information in the description box so while your candy syrup is boiling you can prepare your apples so remove the stem from the Apple and then just insert a popsicle stick into the Apple about halfway these are Gala apples because it happens to be what I have in the house you can use whatever Apple you prefer and I also thought I would try doing half apples because sometimes eating an entire candied apple is a little bit too much especially for kids so I wanted to try these half apples so once that mixture has come to 285 degrees Fahrenheit take it off the heat and then carefully add a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half a teaspoon of red food coloring and then stir that in and it might fit up a little bit so just do it carefully once that's thirty you are ready to dip your apples into the sugar syrup make sure your apples are nice and dry and then dip the apples into the candy mixture I just do a little dip and a turn and make sure it's completely coated once it's coated and remove it from the syrup and just let it drip off and I suggest you let as much as you can drip off of the Apple because you want to try to make that coating fairly thin so it's just easier to eat then you're going to place it on a greased cookie sheet a cookie sheet covered with grease aluminum foil or in this case I'm using my trusty silicone mat and there I am dipping another Apple you'll find that as the sugar syrup starts to cool a bit you may get some bubbles in the mixture and you might see those on the apples but that's okay they're still thought they'll still be fine now for the half apples the cut apples I was talking about dip them into the candy mixture and I found I guess because of all the moisture on the cut surface of the Apple the sugar just wouldn't stick to it and also the sugar syrup has started to cool quite a bit at that point so it didn't really work very well I also found that when you put the candy Apple was half on the cookie sheet that the cut up will continue to release juice and it started to melt the sugar and it was really kind of sticky and messy so didn't really work out that great so if you want to do half apples use caramel or use chocolate now when you're done with all of the apples take out as much as you can of that sugar syrup on the bottom fill the pan with water put it on low heat and just let it heat and all that sugar that's stuck to the pot will dissolve you can also put it in some hot soapy water and just let it sit that'll do the same thing not that difficult to clean up at all there are the apples these are good to eat the same day or the next day at the maximum because the candy will start to absorb moisture from the air and they'll start to get sticky now if you've ever had candy apples you'll know that these can be really hard to bite into for that first bite you have to crack through that hard candy shell so these may not be suitable for really little kids or you might have to try to get it started for them by cracky image candy shell because the candy is so sweet I find that the best apple to use for this is a tart apple like a McIntosh it's a nice complement to all that sugar so there you go a traditional Halloween or fall treat the candied apple give it a try thank you so much for sticking around to the end of this video and for those of you that are still here and haven't clicked off I want to tell you what someone's super special her name is

"Xr5Y9wIOR1M": "[Music] hi there welcome to stated his kitchen today I am SuperDuper duper excited because I'm going to show you my best ever recipe which I absolutely love to make I'm showing you how to make my bubblegum flavored lollipops kids absolutely adore eating them but adults have to make them so let's get started get yourself a nice heavy base small pan and in that put 225 grams of glucose syrup I put it in already on top of that you need to put 450 grams of granulated sugar and on top of that 80 mil of cold water now I want to turn on your hob to medium-high and I'm just very gently very very very gently just going to stir in the glucose syrup so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan now get a lid and pop it on and set your timer for about four minutes what you want is to self clean aside so everything now is going to bubble up the steam is going to take the sugar off the sides and self-clean the sides so there won't be any crystallization of the sugar the most important thing about making these lollipops is that everything has to be ready before you start so that when your sugar is ready to pour you are ready to you need to get yourself loli molds and lolly sticks I definitely prefer plastic lolly sticks than wooden ones it's important to have a sugar thermometer because you're lonely pops have to get up to 154 degrees we've got ice water here ready to plunge the pan into when the temperature reaches 154 degrees we've got all of sprinkles ready and also all of our flavorings ready they go sugars now bubbling away nicely and the sides are perfectly clean it's probably going to take around ten minutes to get up 254 degrees the hard crack stage at this point you want to keep your fingers well away from this sugar syrup it would not be funny if it goes on your fingers and also if you've got children around make sure you put it on the hob over here 154 we're stopping now okay we're plunging it I've got to plunge it straight into the straight into the ice water because you want to stop the sugar immediately 1:54 you want to stop it immediately from cooking very gently move it around sorry it so important not to let any of the water go into the sugar syrup at this point if you're experienced at lolli making you can pour it directly into the molds but I think it's best for us if you pour it straight into a jug I'll put this in me and the sink I'm putting a strange thing with some hot water in it for this otherwise it'll stick to the sides it'll be a nightmare to get off later so if you put into a jars and then put some hot water in your pan it's gonna make the clear-up process a lot lot easier now it's time to put in your food flavoring um I've decided to use bubble gum today because it's absolutely the children's favorite but there are so many different ones you can choose from in my box I have great watermelon candy floss strawberry coca-cola banana I mean the list is endless today it's bubble gum and in a jug of this size you probably need about 10 tiny drops 1 and then just leave it for a little bit and before you know it the whole thing the whole room is going to smell a bubble gum and it's delightful wait for the bubbles to to subside a little bit and that's time to start your pouring you ready okay be very very very gentle very very very very careful want to take it up just to the top covering your sticks a nice stream going slide it over these little bits here just crossed that they crust up and they could just be peeled off at the end should always try and make lollipops when the weather is quite cold is a perfect time of year for lollipops if it's summer and it's humid it's very very difficult to make lollies because they go with sticky and disgusting let's see if I can try and get another one once it starts getting a little bit thicker if you've got it in a jug like this you could pop the jug in the microwave just until it starts bubbling and then you can reuse it okay to make sure every stick is in correctly now I'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 10 let's just finish them off so I've managed to get eleven out of that mouth sugar if you wanted to double it and do double the amount of sugar and double them up glucose syrup that's also fine it's now time to decorate you need to it's a little bit of practice this takes a little bit of trial and error because you obviously can't touch your sugar but you need to know when the right time is to put the sprinkles on because if we put the sprinkles on too early but what happen is the heat will just make them melt but you know what it will take a little bit of time but I think these are probably ready now I'm gonna use some of these gorgeous embellishments they're just sugar embellishments and you can pop them on your lollipops and they make them look absolutely fabulous be very very careful when you put them on though pop it down and push it in remember the sugar super hot hey go if you leave it too long to put the embellishments on what will happen is they won't stick at all because there'll be nothing for them to stick to this ones are getting a little bit hard now so you've got to be super quick these are so pretty okay so I've used as embellishments now the rest of them I'm gonna do well you can use any sprinkle you want really it doesn't matter my children really like it when I put millions on them no those millions you can get or nerds they're great as well I'm putting because it's Christmas I'm doing Christmas balls on this one and I think I'll do some stars on this on the others it's basically showing you can use anything really anything you want to use so put a red one and a white one and green one on there green one go white one and a red one on there now what you have to do is give them about ten minutes to set and as soon as they set you can take them out of the molds we've left these to cool for 10 minutes now it's time to take them out and finish cooling on a piece of baking parchment pretty down as you can see the little bits that are touching them it's just falling off the side and you can always just try bit and see if you like them these are without a doubt favorite any kind of kids party or children's gathering even add r72 now we can leave them on the baking parchment until they're cold to the touch and then they're going to go straight into their own individual cellophane bags so when they're being stored they don't stick to each other and also once you add a nice little ribbon on them or they're perfect to give as a gift so there we have it now you know how to make your own tasty gorgeous Christmas lollipops perfect for children at this time of year thank you so much for watching my video if you enjoyed it then please click subscribe because I'm going to be adding so many more see you soon you", "L-VMsiLeoaM": "[Music] hi welcome to time into light animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and rusty you guys welcome back thank you so much almost at the 13,000 mark Louisville all right so today I thought I'd do something a little fun for us I got my air conditioning going so I'm doing a little candy-making here so everybody loves candy apples but as for me I never like to make anything normal and so I of course done but then I'm going to show you how to make these really pretty decorated ones so this isn't like just a kind of a random decorated one and these ones are called galaxy ones you can see that yeah these sprinkles and the white and the purple and I'm gonna show you how to make I'll show you how to make these these ones I made with can of butter and these ones I made with our can of sugar so I've got both sides for you covered all right so I don't have much more to say about that oh one thing if you want to say if you do the candid butter the syrup does turn out a lot thicker because of the emulsifier so just to let you know that and originally I thought this candy recipe was supposed to make six apples for the amount that we're doing however it does not it only does about three so just to let you know that little alteration there and other than I'm gonna jump right into the ingredients and we'll get started alrighty so for our can of butter can candy apples what we're going to need is a one cup of white sugar 1/2 a cup of light corn syrup 2 tablespoons of our can of butter 3/4 of a cup of water and about 5 to 6 apples that's what this recipe will do now if you want to double it then how you pretty much straight up double all ingredients so it's a pretty easy straight double up and yeah and to make sure to prepare wash your apples make sure they're nice and dry and you want room temperature and you can put the sticks in them to have them prepared so I've used two cookie sticks these cookie sticks there are nice size and they're nice and sturdy so it's very simple you take out your stem and just shut down there and that's it all right so you want to have all those prepared ahead of time and as I said you want your apples at room temperature because if you submerse a cold apple into a candy syrup you're gonna solidify your syrup very very quickly and we don't want to do that all right so we'll get into Oh sorry you're also going to need oops is so for doing the multicolored if you want to just do a standard red throw on some red food coloring you're gonna have the clear but of course I always have to get fancy and so I'm good at to do different kinds and good you won't just with random design and then when I get to Kanna syrup ones I'm going to do a galaxy one which I'm hoping to turn it really cool so you want to have white the white little--i I'd say it or not icing oh my god white food coloring this is gonna Creek Reba giving you up why can't I talk today this is going to give you a solid background or a solid color it's also gonna help us to create swirls so you want to have the white and then whatever paper color combination that you want to do now for the galaxy I'm going to be doing a purple with the white and with edible glitter silver glitter the other thing we're going to need is some soy lecithin is an emulsifier for our butter and we're going to use about a half a teaspoon of our soy lecithin alright so I'm gonna get into our equipment and then we'll get it all started alright so the equipment that we're going to need all you're gonna need is a small or a medium pot depending on the batch size that you're doing you are going to need a candy thermometer a spatula and or a small whisk sometimes I used to list sometimes they don't so just keep one on the end if I end up using it I probably it will board this side of the recipe measuring spoons and then a glass of hot water with a pastry brush this is for down the sides of the pot and that's all we need to get this started so I'm gonna get our ingredients put it all in the pot oh one thing I do want to tell you if it is hot because it is summer now if it is hot and humid in your place do not even bother to attempt to do this recipe until the fall time if be hot the heat and humidity do not work well with candy at all if you've got air conditioning giddy up you're good to go and so I'm gonna get this stuff together for you and we're gonna make some really cool candy apples oh and always I forget you're also just gonna want a punch line and to lick to rest our candy apples on for them to dry you know always forget something whoo all right so into our pot goes our one cup of sugar our 3/4 of a cup of water and our off a cup of corn syrup and we don't put the butter in chili in so I haven't forgotten it it just doesn't go in until we're done so we're gonna get those three ingredients mixed together step out of my way so you just gonna mix this to combine your sugar water and corn syrup now you may have noticed if you've done other candy recipes like hard candy you may have noticed as it seems to be an awful lot of water and the reason that is is this is gonna create a sigh that thinner candy coating versus a thick candy coating the the texture of your hard candy is all dependent about the amount of water that goes in air regardless of the amount of water that goes in you're still cooking off like 93 percent of it when we cook it to 300 degrees but it's the amount obviously that we have so using more water is going to give us a thinner thinner candy hard candy versus if I use a quarter cup of water we're going to have a very thick hard candy which would not be good for coating so now that I've got our water and everything combined here I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high only now again normally with a candy syrups or regular hard candy we cook it in a medium to medium low with this because the amount of water we actually wanted to cook it at a rapid at a more rapid temperature so we're going to cook it at medium-high and that's going to allow that water to cook off quicker and not have our sugar burn so you're going to continue to stir your syrup until until it begins to boil as soon as it starts to boil we are going to stop stirring and the other thing you're going to use your hot water and your pastry brush to wash down any crystals that are on the side of your pot because they can interfere with your candy making they can burn and or and they can also cause your candy to crystallize yeah it starts to go clear so it's gonna go nice and clear but as it gets up to the 300 degree temperature that we're gonna have it's gonna get a little bit caramelized looking a little amber with getting caramelized and you've gone too far so now that my syrup is starting to boil I'm going to stop stirring and I'm going to put in my candy thermometer and we are going to cook this syrup two to three hundred degrees Fahrenheit and now the only thing that you are going to do is to if you've got sugar anything that forms on the side you're just gonna wash down the sides of the pot but we're not going to stir this anymore yeah just let you know for your candy syrup it was while it's boiling it's gonna sit at about 212 250 for a while and that's the boiling point of water so that's where a majority if your water is gonna boil is boil off then it's going to increase to about 220 and it's gonna sit there again for a time being again that's our Lord the water is actually boiling off well once it starts to increase pasta to 21 to 23 it starts to go very quickly so don't leave your kitchen at that point just always stay close to the end when you're cooking handy because as I said it can be sitting at the 220 mark for about 7 to 10 minutes we don't think I'm good and walk away and come back three minutes later and but you're burnt or you've missed the temperature that you want 300 you're you're pretty good you've got a pretty good margin but as I said especially when you're new to it definitely stay close and handy keep a close eye on your candies of all around my candy syrup it's almost ready it's almost getting to temp it's it it's hitting about 290 right now and it's increasing rapidly so I am NOT gonna leave this area and I'm gonna keep an eagle eye on like thermometer now what I'm gonna do is when it hits 298 I'm gonna pull it and sit it on my stone counter now if you have marble or a natural stone it is the best thing to be able to use because it absorbs the heat now it starts to heat quickly and doesn't burn or or ya don't have to worry about shush you don't have to worry about burning or anything it helps to bring the temperature down quickly so just waiting for this to stop bubbling here and to come down just below my 300 ish mark I'm going to wait for it to get to about 260 these we drop the butter in too hot we don't want it we don't want a chance burning the butter the butter burns at a fairly low temperature well technically 340 but I don't like to play with that actually no I don't want it to go to two I'm gonna live we're gonna take it out and start it at 280 I can remove my cane and you want to make sure that your can of butter is melted and I'm going to put that in try to see where my spatula went to this one will do and I'm going to add in a half a teaspoon of soy you can also use sunflower lecithin and you're going to dribble that evenly or whatever get it all over evenly over your butter just get it all around then you are going to very gently stir start stirring this from the center and it is going to bubble up so you see your butter and that you know this is what's called this isn't a must a multiplication this is where we the blesseth in is going to pull the butter and your sugar and water together into one unified uniform syrup if you do not use an emulsifier you cannot mix oil and water and when you're doing an emulsification you always go from the stirrer from the center rapidly but again safely and it pulls the stuff in from the sides and then everything gets all mixed together so we're going to continue to mix this until it is all one color and now if it starts to get too hard you can put your temperature on low and just keep it melted you want to be careful because it does splash up that's there we have our our butter and our sugar and water are all combining together our syrup it didn't see it gets very thick with the emulsifier okay dokay and so you're going to continue to mix this for about a minute or two and as I said if it starts to get too solidified you can just put both feet on low until it starts to melt again yeah you want to so next I'm gonna get my apples in my little tray get them ready and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make my base white let's get a little thick I'm gonna make my base white I need a sous chef okay those little off-white because of the test of the green in there so I'm gonna try and do some Rasta colors being that they're Canada why not so you take your coloring and you just make some drops into your into your watching it's your syrup oh you know what I'm talking about anymore I think the yellow is supposed to go in the middle where's my yellow not your thoughts yellow-orange won't find it but I was gonna kind of move those colonies a little bit around and then little bit more the green I didn't live oil green I'm sure if I like that water green it's just showing that you can either use oil the gel base for the oils so I just want to make a little kind of designs on here just little spots and you kind of move them around a little bit and then we're gonna take our Apple gonna you're gonna tip it this way you take your Apple and just scooter around try and get a nice even coat and there go just let the excess drip off and then just put her onto your sheet I'm gonna see if I can get these colors a little more intensified I'm not really happy with them let's see the green gel let's get a little bit more in there so what I'm doing is I'm kind of moving it right down into the bottom and let's try let me use orange for yellow okay where there we go adds a nice Orkut nicer on the green and then what I'll have is every pattern will be different you just let the excess come on put her on your sheet to dry that's a nice thing they don't take too long to cool and dry about an hour and you're good to go now as you get more do more bags like more apples on it if your colors are gonna get a little bit muddled so just keep that in mind starting to get it all the way down more to that bottom part this is a pretty one and that's it that's your can of butter cannon can of butter candy apples yeah say that 10 times fast well I don't touch now this one's almost broke this one's pretty much dry this is our first one kind of little too much white color wasn't that great i ones not set yet I'll show you that one when it's dry all right and then any extra candy syrup that you do have hang on you can perch line a pan or cookie tray and then just pour that on there and you got yourself some candy you just break it up when it's whoops do that now I'm gonna let you know it's not gonna be probably the prettiest of colors but candies candy but yeah so that's what you can do with the excess or any excess that you've got just pour it on there and then you can break it up when it's hardened and just up that's the month suck on that alright so next we're going to do the quince syrup and can of sugar version so I hope if you have any questions with regards to that don't hesitate to put those in and happy to answer those and like I said I'm gonna get into the can of sugar and the cane syrup ones alright so for our can of sugar or sloshed can is Sarah however you want to do it you can do a combination of both or just use one or the other so actually what I'm doing today because I'm trying to do these galaxy ones which look really cool and we've got a purple to them and purple and green actually make brown so I don't want to end up with a very green background or this so for that's for that reason good I'm going to use only candy sugar so I'm only I'm not going to do the we can of syrup part but if I just making normal red ones or something that didn't require having to fight with green and then I would do half and half of my can of syrup but I'll get into the amounts right here sorry babbling I digress alright so for this recipe you will need 1/2 a cup of candy sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar or as I said any combination you can do you can go with the one cup of can of sugar if you like whatever it is as long as it's 1 cup of sugar however you want to do that and I'm doing 1/2 a cup of light corn syrup and again like I said you can do a quarter cup or you can do all half 1/2 of the can of syrup Oh a little too much today you're going to need 3/4 of a cup of water so that's it for our ingredients and it's nice now this syrup is going to turn it up a lot different than the one with the butter with the butter it turns out a lot thicker because of the emulsifier so really thickens it up however this it's going to turn out more like a real candy apple at a nice thin that thin candy coating versus that thicker I'm not quite sure how to combat the thicker I'd say work towards doing um candy sugars instead that's why I really moved to tinctures because you can make so many base ingredients from of your tinctures and it's so much easier to work recipes with what are actually supposed to be there as in butter has no business being in candy in cave your gelatin or things like that well a little bit of it but not that much anyway I I'll stop the aggressing again and we'll get this started equipments exactly the same as with the butter you need a pot candy thermometer spatula just I said for the galaxy I'm gonna use purple with a little bit of blue or white and our edible silver glitter alright so I'm gonna jump right in and get started on this so to our pot we add our sugar oops I forgot one major the important thing whenever you are working with candy sugar or cane is syrup you we have to grease the pot first so thankfully I remember that before I got started so hang on with me one second alright so as I said when you're working with candy sugar or can of syrups it is very important to always grease any materials that you are working with and the reason is as the sugars heat up the THC oil separates and it will stick the to metal and you will not be able to get it off and we don't want that we because THC is oil soluble as long as we grease our pan and our utensils it will come right off so don't ever forget that very important step so you just gonna lightly spray your pan and then we just remove any of the excess and just make sure it's oh all over your pot and then even on those little screws in there I'm gonna just remove the excess so we just want a nice light layer okay so back to step one we all put our sugar in the pot our corn syrup in our 3/4 cup of water and you're gonna stir that to combine your sugar and your sugar and water and syrup you're gonna stir gently until it's all combined so see that green a lot of that I'm hoping it's gonna cook off otherwise that Purple's gonna have a hard time all right so what's all your sugar and your your water sugar and syrups are combined you want to set your heat to medium-high so such a meat heat to medium-high a little too high and then you're going to continue to stir it until it begins to boil now also with this as you see any breed or darkness forming on the side of the pot we're going to take your edge your spatula and you're gonna scrape that off so you can see a little bit already there and we're going to continue to do that during the cooking process so normally I always say stop stirring so we're not gonna stir but we're going to gently continue to scrape the edges of our pot to make sure that that keeps the oil in stays in our syrup versus the side of the pot so actually in this instance here we're not going to use our brush in the water because what happens is that all the stuff gets stuck to the brush can you tell I made that mistake before pretty much when I tell you to do something or how to do something or not to do something that's because I've done it messed it up and go home they let you know that oh see that's that's the oil there you want to make sure that that box just hold it back in the syrup and will just melt off now also let you know when you're using the THC or the sugars or the canons you will get a foamy this stuff and that's the excess or impurities that are left from the from drying off of the dehydrating and your sugars and stuff so don't worry about it all of that will cook off and we'll trim it to a clear syrup so my Stewart might miss my syrup is starting to boil so at this point I'm just like I said gonna continue to clean the edges gently so you don't want to go deep into your syrup you just want to stay at the edge and near the top and just very gently scrape that off and then just let it melt back in and we're gonna add our candy thermometer and we are going to cook this to 300 degrees very now when your syrup hits about 230 degrees you won't have to scrape the side so much be oil starts to kind of blend in at that point and all of this stuff on the budget stuff that you see on the top here that stuff will clip off those impurity you can see it that well those will all cook off now if you let you know when you're cook syrup looks like my digital thermometer got a little wet there and cannot read the display that's why you don't really use digital but just so much easier to read now as you can see all of that impurity stuff is now cooked off and the surface a lot clearer now to let you know your candy syrup is going to increase to about 215 216 degrees Fahrenheit and it's gonna sit there for a little bit probably about 5 to 10 minutes that's when your water that's the boiling point of water so that's where your water is starting to boil off and then it's going to increase to about you 20 to 23 depending and it's also gonna sit there for a bit of a time period and that's what we have it there the majority of your water is then continuing to boil off so don't worry and start thinking that nothing's happening it is once it passes at 223 mark it will start to increase rapidly so don't go too far now if you're used to candy making it's tough you know your time you can you can kind of walk away however if you're new to it I highly recommend to stay very close by and keep a close eye on your candy thermometer especially once it passes the two 2223 mark there and that's about it nothing much exciting I'm gonna let you know when this hits 300 and what we do neck high so we're always getting up to temperature however my theory for doing sugar another syrup didn't really work in the color aspect because I forgot that the your candy syrup is gonna amber get amber as it gets to that 300 and with the green we've got a darker color than I anticipated next time I'm gonna try with syrup see if that makes a difference instead of the sugar so right now I am at 298 because our circle continued to what's wrong I'm gonna pull it at 298 because it'll continue to cook what you'll bring us over the 300 and this way you don't have a chance of shut up you don't have a chance of burning your syrup you can click it up to 310 but if you go over and then pull it and it goes over that you're gonna burn your syrup and trust me burn not good so I'm just waiting for this to stop bubbling for this to come down in temperature so I know the cooking process is stopped now the best thing to use if you've got one is a marble it's marble or any natural stone the reason is is it takes away the heat really quickly and the surrounding area doesn't heat up so it's a really great material to use with for candy making which is why you always see candy makers using marble alright so Mike coming down I'm gonna remove my thermometer and I'm going to add in my couple I so hope this works purple I'm just gonna stir that in first make sure it's all dark purple and see when you add in your color it heats up again so it's stirred kind of starts that cooking continues a cooking process so if you go over that 300 you have a good chance of burning it so now getting that mixed in I just want some of these bubbles to work out I'm gonna get my candy apples right here and now we're gonna eat it so I've got the nice purple probably looks more blocked to you but it is a really nice dark purple and then you're gonna take your white food coloring and we're just gonna make some little drops screw it kind of like that you see that oops I don't want that to move too much well I'm just gonna move them around just a little bit maybe I need a little more then you're gonna take your Apple tilt your pot a little bit towards you so we can get a nice deep syrup and then you're gonna just twist it through and then just let the excess drip off then you're going to take your edible glitter put her down on the parchment paper and take your edible glitter and just give her a light spray oh he's so pretty oh okay let's do the next one and each time you do this you're gonna get a different kind of design no you're never gonna have to the same so it makes them really unique for gifts you can also do them for a party or something a theme you can do colored themes for them I'm gonna let that drip down a little bit around the Apple again I mean let's let the excess come off and put spray some my glitter oh these are so pretty whoops I'm gonna add him because the weights dissipating so I'm gonna add in a little bit more weight here and I'm just gonna do my last Apple so it gets a little harder as your um sir as your syrup solidifies if it does get too thick you can just put it on low heat to kind of to remelt it there I'm just being lazy and glitter and that's it we have these beautiful galaxy apples yes yeah it firmed up there so what you can do just put it on low heat I'll be able to read put it on low heat here and little degree melts it a little bit here I just want to get a little try and get a little bit around the top here I didn't get it deep enough so originally this recipe I thought it was was supposed to make about 6 apples which clearly it doesn't so I would recommend probably definitely doing a double of this recipe if you want to do it you want six or more apples because definitely the half of it is only does 3 get this a little bit melted see if I can fill in this top a little bit yeah I probably just I wouldn't do that one dip and leave it yeah wow that is some thunderstorm coming now what you can do if you thought you have extra candy syrup laughter you don't want to waste it because we never want to waste it what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna throw in a little bit more weight here just to kind of make it pretty when we drop it and I'm just gonna drop it on the line parchment paper here and then that way when it solidifies hardens up you can just break it up and enjoy its candy and that's it for our candy apples so I got our galaxy candy apples and our candy butter cut at candy apples so I'm going to be back to say goodbye as normal and dumped yeah do my uh do my exit so guys that is my tutorial there on our candy apples both our can of butter and our candy sugar or cane syrup I hope you enjoyed that have fun with different colors and experiment like I said you can do them theme party so if you kind of whatever color theme you can do them that way you can experiment with the designs and things like that so please would love to hear your comments if you make these how they turned out what colors you may have done have any questions at all obviously it please don't hesitate to put them in there and again thanks so much for watching and subscribing means the world to me have an awesome day thanks so much [Music]", "hd9HlqAKpJM": "[Music] okay you guys so i'm going to make some caramel

crushed um almonds some biscoff lotus cookies that i um crushed and some mini m m's [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "PwKK9_hCv2M": "hi guys it's Kay so today I wanted to make some caramel apples it's fall time it's almost Halloween and you cannot let the year pass by without having one of these babies so I decided to show you today how to make gourmet caramel apples if you want to learn how to make this just keep watching so you're going to need quite a few things for this first thing being soft caramel you're also going to need a few pieces of the hard caramels and that's just going to help the caramel be a little bit tougher when you put it on the Apple so it doesn't really run off um you're going to need some water some butter and that's all for the caramel part then for the toppings there's an array of toppings that you can use this is just what I'm going to be using today but you can use anything you like I have some toasted chopped peanuts I have some Butterfinger some or chopped Butterfinger some chopped Snickers and then also have some white and dark candy melts because I wanted to drizzle some of my apples in chocolate but you're also going to need quite a few apples depending on how big your apples are is how many karma apples this recipe is going to make just if you have small of course you're going to get more and I chose smaller apples so that I can get more out of it you're also going to need some apple sticks if you don't have apple sticks you can also use popsicle sticks will work just fine as well and then you're also going to need a saucepan with a tiny bit of water in it so that you can melt your caramels over a double boiler you can also do it in the microwave but I'm just choosing to do it over a double boiler and lastly you are going to need some water that has been boiling for a little bit that cooled down for the apples so let's go ahead and get started so I forgot to mention guys you are going to need a cookie sheet lined with some parchment paper it's best to use parchment paper just because after you dip the apples in caramel and you let them sit in the refrigerator parchment paper I find is easiest to get the caramel from the Apple so if you don't have a parchment paper you can use wax paper but make sure you butter it really good so that you won't have that much trouble getting the caramel step rated from the paper but the first thing we want to work on are the apples you want to make sure that you wash and dry your apples and then you want to try to get this wax off of your Apple to do that you want to take a pan of water put it on the eye let it boil and then let it cool down a little bit and then now what we're going to do is take the apples and put them in the hot water that's going to kind of melt off of the wax from the apple that way when we go to dip it in the caramel it sticks a little bit better this water is extremely hot or at least - so you do want to be careful and I do have just some little salad tongs here to be able to help me get the apples out but all you want to do is just put them in there you don't want to leave them in there for long because you don't want your apples to cook but you want to just be able to get that wax off so let them in there just for a few seconds and then in the water you can actually see the wax and it's kind of gross but you just want to try to get that off after you do that you just want to put them let them dry you're going to have to end up drying them too by hand but skip them all out and then after you have them all out you just want to dry them really really well caramel is not going to stick to the apple if it's wet so just try to make sure you get everything out and I doubt that you can tell on camera but now the apples are dull that's what you want you don't want them to be super shiny anymore um did you want the wax gone so I'm going to dry these up finish the rest of these and we'll be back once you have all your apples dipped wax removed and dried very well you want to take your apple sticks or your popsicle sticks you're just going to insert it into the Apple I did remove the stems from all the apples too to do that of course you just take the Apple twist the stem and it will come right off but now you just want to take the stick and insert it into the Apple I like the Apple sticks just because it does have a pointy side and it's much easier to get the stick in but you just want to poke it in quite a bit ways and you just want to make sure that it's going to stay in there and then after we get all this done now comes the waiting part you want to put these in your refrigerator for about thirty to thirty minutes to an hour you want to make sure that your apples are nice and cold for when you stick them into the caramel that's going to help the caramel not run down the Apple and make it adhere to it much better so you want to make sure your apples are super cold one thing you could do is you can do this the day before put them in the refrigerator overnight and then the next day you can dip them in the caramel I don't have very much patience so I don't do that I decided to just do it all in one day but now we're going to put this in the refrigerator for about thirty minutes to an hour let them get super cold and then we're going to start dipping them in our caramel so when the apples have about ten minutes left to go in the refrigerator you want to go ahead and start on your caramels you want to unwrap every single caramel it's very tedious but you want to get them all unwrapped to this you want to add the four hard caramel the butter and the water and then you're going to put this over a small saucepan of simmering water you want to make sure that the water is barely coating the bottom you don't want the water to touch the bottom of the bowl and this is just going to sit here you're just going to let it melt while it's melting you just want to stir it to get it melted and what I'll do is I'll work on mine let it start melting when it's about halfway done I'll show you what it looks like and then once it's completely done we will go ahead and start on our apples you do want to make sure that you leave the apples in the refrigerator until this is completely done because you want them to be as cold as possible so I'm going to work on melting this and when we're about halfway show you what it looks like so this is about the halfway point we are almost there it's watery but there's still some chunks in it it's been at this stage I guess for about five six minutes it's going to take probably another all close to ten minutes to finish up here but you just want to make sure it's completely solid and thick so we're just going to finish up another maybe eight minutes or so and then we should be done so this is what your Carmel needs to end up looking like it needs to roll off of your spatula your spoon very nicely nice and thin coat of it so now what we're going to do is start dipping the apples now I took them out of the refrigerator just a few seconds ago and enough time to come here but what you want to do now is just take an apple make sure it's completely dry you're just going to dip it in the caramel roll it around you might have to do a few coats of it and you do want to make sure that you work awfully fast the caramel is going to get a little cold because the apples are cold so you just want to make sure that you're working kind of fast you want to let most of the excess drip off you can also take it to the side and just rub it off too and then depending on if you want your caramel apple just to be like this or you can go ahead and dip it in some nuts which I'm going to do here you can do whatever you wish to do with the caramel apples you want to try to stir the caramel in between because like I said it is going to harden as you go because it's apples are cold if it does get a little bit too thick where you can't coat your apples anymore you can go ahead and stick it in the microwave or you can put it back on your double boiler to melt it a little bit but I'm just going to continue here you just want to roll it around in the caramel and then I'm going to sprinkle it with little pieces of Snickers because it's my husband's favorite just going to put them on there but once you have all of them coated you want to put it back in the refrigerator for about an hour so they can set up and get nice and hard so that you can eat them all so I'm not showing it here but you can always note the candy melts that we had and drizzle it that's what I plan on doing for the majority of my apples so once I'm done here and they've set I'll come back and show you what everything looks like if you want to drizzle the apples in chocolate all you have to do is melt your candy melts in the microwave 30-second intervals stirring in between then you just want to put them in either a piping bag or a sandwich bag and just drizzle the chocolate or on the Apple if anyways I'm going to finish up here and then when I am done I'll come back and show you the final result so that is it guys it does take a little bit of time to refrigerate but once you have it down they are so pretty and they're so delicious and they'd be perfect for any party or just at home for a special treat the total time it took me was maybe and now we're and a half or so not too long the longest thing is just waiting for the caramel to get hard but that's it I'm just going to cut into it's see what it looks like inside so good the caramel is nice and thick on there and it's just so yummy but to get the written recipe go to my blog it's kay Randall's Kay's random blog com you can get the written recipe there super simple anyone could really do it I wanted to show you guys real quick I did line them with these little liners I found them at Michael their craft and their like coated with something so that the caramel doesn't stick to it so I thought those were cool you could put it in a cellophane bag tie it with a bow and I'd be great or you can serve them just like this but if you guys have any questions at all definitely leave them in the comments down below don't forget to give the video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel that's all I have for today until next time guys bye", "uhb9r94Gfw4": "you are

know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i definitely wish them the best obviously but cheers boys we're going to take off this i have to be careful not to

much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like

make the most sour lollipops let's do this okay here's how to make the lollipops you're gonna need a lot of sugar some corn syrup lollipop molds food coloring lemon extract and the secret ingredient malic acid let's start by pouring some corn syrup into a hot pot as well as some water now to make it more appealing i added blue food coloring and to make it a little more sour i added some lemon extract just a little bit actually i added all of the lemon extract into the pot when the mixture starts boiling this is the perfect time to add the sugar just like this now just mix the sugar right into the solution and now it's time to add the malic acid if you don't know what this is this is usually what they put in every sour thing you eat except this time it is more concentrated and now let's mix this all up and make sure it dissolves and then let's add some more malic acid why not we're making the sourest lollipop now grab your candy thermometer and let's get this thing at 300 degrees fahrenheit this is where it surprised me it used to be blue and now it's like murky creepy ugly green after 10 minutes it turned into swampy dark green it's ugly and then guess what after 10 minutes it turned into chocolate i'm just kidding this is not chocolate but it looks like it it's kind of gross looking well anyways that's done so let's start setting up the lollipop molds and start pouring this nasty all right so i let this thing like cool down for about like two hours so it should be really good so let's slowly take these lollipops out of the whoa whoa that's not good maybe i'm supposed to push it oh i see i see ah i got it oh my gosh check that out this used to be blue and then it turned green and now it's straight up black so um yeah the world's sourest lollipop right here

below if you are wanting to see something specific and of course I will make it thank you you", "O27gUK_3WIQ": "[Music] hi I'm Margie and welcome back to my kitchen what I've made today using these cinnamon red hots up brand new jar I'm opening just to show you I'll probably make more but they look I know you can see little cinnamon red hots okay and these have a very nice cinnamon flavor and they add color to the candy apples that I made color and the flavor and because of the cinnamon they're little spicy so they're just a little hot but when you add them to all the liquid with the candy they're not it just gives the Apple that flavor that you expect from a candy apple that is the original candy apple flavor is cinnamon so I'm gonna get started right away and I hope you guys have a wonderful fall and Halloween the first thing I want to talk to you about is the apples these are Fiji apples I want to show you the difference really in the two apples this is a regular Apple off the shelf and this is a bagged apple which is actually pretty big see the difference so I want to wash these apples and prepare them for the sticks the best kind of a stick to use for a candy apple would be something very safe for children so a popsicle stick would really be the best but I don't have popsicle sticks I have these sticks that have points on them so don't use these if you have children around I want all of my apples when they're standing somewhere on display for their sticks that go straight up and down so if you have an apple that's tilted you don't really want to put the Apple in the stick in perfectly for the Apple because if you do then later on all your sticks will be every different direction so I'm going to prepare a few here I don't know how many apples even this some recipe makes because I don't really need to have that many apples on hand and I'm also gonna make the lollipops first thing I have here is a nice heavy-bottomed saucepan and a wooden spoon we'll start off by putting the water in this is 1/3 of a cup of water and I have a cup of sugar when you're making candy and you add sugar you always want to be very careful not to get the sugar on the side of the pot so every step of the way you should be very careful I can even give it good I'm actually just gonna let the water absorb into that you just have to be very careful with sugar you don't want if it gets on the side of the pot it can crystallize your candy more quickly but I don't think that's going to be a problem with these apples and lollipops as I'm sure we're gonna eat them pretty quickly next thing I have here is 1/3 of a cup of corn syrup that helps also to keep your candy from crystallizing it's one of the secret candy ingredients and if you wet your can your little cup measure before you pour the corn syrup in the corn syrup will come out more easily and now here I have these are little cinnamon red hots and one container for this recipe that calls for about a third of a cup so I'll show you here it's gonna be about that I'd even if you may not be quite 1/3 of a cup I'm going to go ahead and add those and it will put the heat on low I'm going to very gently stir this this recipe is so incredibly easy you don't want this to come to a boil until all this sugar is melted and these little cinnamon red hots also are dissolved that's one of the secrets to candy making is when you want to bring something to avoid try to make sure that all the ingredients are dissolved in the liquid before it reaches that boiling point now that everything is dissolved I'm going to add my thermometer just make sure the bulb the red bulb is down inside under the liquid when it starts to boil will boil up to double the amount of liquid that you have in there and then it will come back down that gives you an idea of the size pot you could use I probably could use a pot that's a little bit smaller than this I am going to transfer this to a smaller pot and we'll see how it does as soon as you are done with your candy pots just fill them up with water and let them set and all that sugar will dissolve I don't want to hear that anybody's been scrubbing their candy pots and now that bulb goes right under the liquid and I won't have to play with the thermometer here it goes is starting to boil up oh no I think that's as far as it's going to go how pretty that is you even let it cool down just a little I tested to see the color of this if you want that to be a little teeny bit redder you can take some red food coloring just take regular red food coloring vegetable color see now this is that has gotten cleared it's not all that red I could add a couple of drops of color to that you can take a pot holder hold on to the handle real close and just lean your pot over to the side put your apple in sideways and just give your Apple a twist just let the candy drip a little bit then go ahead and set it down on your parchment paper do the next one this will stay hot for for a little while so don't worry about it you can even scrape the bottom a little bit you can double this recipe you can even triple the recipe it's the technique that you use that's the important thing see how pretty this is just a zippy bag and actually as pretty as a green line on it so that's kind of you know Apple ish you don't need something really fancy if you go to a packaging store like a gift store papers stores sometimes they have all sorts of very pretty bags for different holidays I find a problem sometimes with those very fun decorated bags is that once you're done packaging it you don't really see the item because there's something covering it up you go ahead and tie a little bow around it if it starts to get hard and you want to make the lollipops or you find us getting a little harder to use you can take this and you can put it into the microwave for about 15 seconds you you so I'm going to show you the lollipop hold your stick very still it'll make a nice round lollipop you can make it as long as you want stick your stick in there and give it a twist you these lollipops are all done and again you want to wrap them the students they cool and they're very good they taste a little like cinnamon red hats as lollipops are very very candy they much [Music]", "STFotBfPVuo": "[Music] hi everybody this is a now for your ties with imagine this TV

way to describe its flavor guys it says it in the actual liquid itself caramel lollipop the first thing you can taste right towards that exhale is caramel you can taste it right from the beginning into that towards exhale this is absolutely beautiful it's not too much it's not too less and the taste that you get now it's like a black that aftertaste but it's lingering in your throat is a nice lollipop base which is fantastic so actually makes you feel like you're having a caramel lollipop but in an e liquid form Wow what flavor so I've been having this flavor for a few days guys and I actually do really like here I think you saw all day all day vape hundred-percent it is different to the rainbow lollipop now the two flavors are completely different the caramel is completely different to the rainbow lollipop as you guys may imagine from the same range though but I can't decide which one I like best yet I will be coming onto though I will be coming on to it as to which one I like best as I do more reviews for this means I've got two more to do so hopefully we'll be getting them done very soon as well today guys this is a very quick big job to bring you all this review I

caramel I tried doing caramel did not work slid right off the Apple and I'm not even gonna discuss what that look like but the chocolate should come out of there so here we go okay you should get about four slices out of an apple make them about I say about a half an inch thick so you can leave the center if you like some people cut it out I'm gonna leave it in because if well I'm just leaving it in because I'm just too lazy to take it out but you can get like a little cookie cutter or something to take out the center you know what else you can do you can make like a pumpkin face on this ice which I'm gonna kill him he laughs every time I say pumpkin you call me boys any way you can say it make like a pumpkin face and then dip it in the chocolate be awesome but here we go you put the stick right through the center just make sure it's secure and then I have this great chocolate that you can buy in the fruit section in the supermarket it's called do chick fruit die but if it's too thin that's the name of it you microwave it okay you're gonna block your Apple a little bit just to get that excess juice off of it and you know chocolate sticks better when you do that and just spread your chocolate over your Apple smell the excess should be good dip it into your sprinkles and when you're gonna put on wax paper this is what it looks like you can decorate it probably a lot better than I did but aren't they nice and it's so much better than like a huge apple cuz personally I can't finish a whole Apple so this to me is a little it's a little better so this whole month I'm gonna be doing Halloween videos and this is the first one chocolate dip abscess", "Ou5OweGCENA": "here is the best way to make homemade caramel first put your sugar in a large clean saucepan it needs to be clean to ensure the sugar crystals melt without crystallizing if you want you can add a little bit of water to evenly distribute the sugar crystals and while you're at it a little bit of lemon juice the lemon juice will prevent crystallization keep the sugar on high heat and don't touch the pot until it begins to take color for three-quarters of a cup of sugar it will take about eight minutes for color to appear at the edges gently swirl the pot to evenly distribute the color and remember when it starts to turn color pay close attention because everything from this point happens very quickly you're looking for to turn a dark amber color or if you're using a candy thermometer you want it to reach 348 degrees if you don't have a candy thermometer one of the best ways to tell if it's ready is to use your nose when you can smell a sweet slightly bitter smell remove the sugar from the heat and immediately stir in your heavy cream with a long-handled wooden spoon don't use a metal spoon because it conducts heat and the sugar is extremely hot and get ready because it'll bubble up like crazy if you're using butter stir it in until it's fully incorporated and that's it you've got smooth rich buttery homemade caramel for more cooking tips from our Test Kitchen checkout Southern Living", "FQWoqcZtoSo": "okay in this video we'll be making candy apples and as you can see my apples are laid out on the tile that I use only the things like this and before I got to this process I had all my apples in the kitchen sink filled up with water I didn't look cold water a whole cup of baking soda and a half a cup of apple cider vinegar and I got him soaked in the water for by the office for two hours and then after I got him out the water I laid him on the town I took a pot of boiling water set it on the sole but a half a cup of apple cider vinegar in it and I dipped each one for 10 to 15 seconds and I laid them out on this towel to dry and I usually let them dry between I let them sit up like 24 to 48 hours so I'm halfway through the process and as you can see your apples will turn brown but don't worry your apples on the inside will be the way they should white and delicious but this is the this is what you want I'll let dry white stuff is wax and all the bubble light water stuff it's not water itself it's actually sticky so you want all that stop to seep out and you want all the wax to come off the apples and before you begin to dip out let's take a dent towel and just wipe the app is clean so you have normal soccer normal wax on the apples and as I wait for another 24 hours I will come back and show you the process and dipping the apples so stay tuned okay now that my apples have been sitting at least 48 hours I have rinsed them under cold water to remove all the SAP I still have a cup of apples to clean because it still have the little white residue the wax on it and I want that completely all but the SAP is completely going up apples but I set these here to let them dry like 30 minutes to an hour and then we'll be ready to dip the apples no SAP see when it's time to do now that all my apples are cleaned Ivan went ahead and put the sticks in so now we're going to get our chit together in this pot we're going to add four cups of sugar a cup of water and two cups of Karo syrup and this the camera cept I'm using the light corn syrup we're going to add some cups of that yeah bear with me I'm trying to hold my home in one hand and work with the other okay now we're going to add that to the back now that our apples are all clean I have a motor here sitting on a piece of parchment paper that I laid out that I'm going to spray with a little cooking spray okay and over this pot I went ahead and add in my four cups of sugar my 1 cup of water and my two cups of light corn syrup which is this what I use okay we're going to stir all this together and I'm going to turn my stove between five and six and I'm also going to add cinnamon you add a little light depending on how you like it I'm going to get that incorporated really well and also to delete some of these headings RIT has come ahead act a hold of the box now excuse my nails because I'm a biter okay we're gonna let this mix come to a bowl add a nap for Mama to into the pot making sure it did not touch the bottom of the pot hmm now all this mix come to a ball do not stir just let it do what it do but don't shy away from the pot because you don't wanna risk the chance of burning your own dick in the mix I'm going to make this a light bright pink color even though I edit the red red hots because if I add a little bright white gel color I never worked with this color before but I'm waiting on my shipment of americolor to come in so the meantime I'm gonna have it work with this so we'll be back when the mix reach about half way which is what be about 225 because we're going to let this mixture where I let my mix come up to about 302 I know some do 300 so I'm do 275 but I'm gonna do three efforts so we be back when this mix get the bubbling is falling you know right on time and it said it said 200 we're almost there just let it ball do not stir don't mess me to make sure yet Vermont is not touching the bottom of the pot so you can get an accurate reading and just wait you know run around make sure you spread your parchment paper or your cookie sheet whatever you place on your Apple zone you know and just get ready to do so we'll be back when it's different time okay my mixtures just coming up to the other past 250 when it gets it to 50 kind of stalls a bit but watch it because it's going to shoot up there in no time so just continue to watch the mix do not mix don't stir at all just be patient so we'll be back when you reach 300k now that my mix have reached 302 I'm going to remove this turn my heat off bring it over here to let the bubbles aside and when all the bubbles go down we're ready to dip so stay tuned okay now get

with a heavy bottom sauce pan and we are going to put in there 1/2 a cup light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water 2 cups of granulated sugar and about half a teaspoon of red food coloring to give it a bright red color we're going to place this mixture on the stove with a candy thermometer and bring it to a boil and let it get up to 310 degrees before dipping our apples you'll just want to leave it in the pot and let it boil to prevent crystallization while we're waiting for our candy coating to reach the temperature of 310 degrees we're going to put wax paper on a sheet pan and grease it really well I have chosen to use granny smith apples a nice hard crisp apple like a Granny Smith or a Honey Crisp works best I have some wooden skewers that I'm going to put straight down the middle you can get craft sticks to do this or popsicle sticks to do this I find the skewers work really good because they have a nice sharp point you'll just put them in there and put some pressure and there you have an apple on a stick okay our candy coating is up to 310 degrees we need to work pretty fast to dip and coat our apples take them and swirl them really quickly trying to coat them evenly and then place them flat onto the parchment smells really good be careful not to burn yourself with this candy it will hurt you and I'm tilting the pan so I can get a fast coating on to the apples here they are some beautiful candy coated apples allow them to cool before serving them that should take about 20 minutes and store them at room temperature thank you for joining us today in the Mahalo kitchen please

to my kitchen and today we have another sweet Halloween treat for you today we're going to be making these chocolate-covered apple pops and they're super easy and oh so delicious so let's go see how these all come together all right we're gonna go over all the ingredients not really ingredients as much as its components to making these really cool sliced Apple pops now we saw these Molly saw them first in her Facebook feed and then she shared it with me and we decided we had to do this so here we are now you can decorate these at the end with anything crushed oreos crushed chocolate chip cookies chocolate chips white chocolate chips Eminem's Reese's Pieces there is no limit to what you can do here today we're going to dip in some candy melts and these are one bag of dark cocoa and one bag of light cocoa that i melted together in the microwave this is some freshly made caramel sauce and then i have two very large honey crisp apples and we're going to go ahead and slice these very thick we're going to drizzle them with white chocolate and caramel i'm going to also put maybe some crushed chocolate graham cracker and mini chocolate chips and like i said you you know the runs the gamut whatever you want it doesn't matter but right now i have my honey crisp apples which i washed with soap and water and then we're just going to go ahead and I'm going to take a super thin slice off of each side here these cheeks we don't want them to be roly-poly so we'll just take that off and then we're going to make a nice thick slice just like that and I have always have these little um stir sticks for coffee on hand there's seven inch stir sticks you can use a popsicle stick it's up to you but that's going to be perfect for our apple pop you can go ahead and take the seeds out with your knife you see any and you'll be good to go so I'm going to go ahead and take this large one here Meester my chocolate up real good make sure that your cup or your vessel that you're dipping in is large enough to handle your apple spread it out so that all of your exposed Apple is covered and I just have it on a parchment-lined baking sheet go ahead and dip another lay it down and then just continue to do that until all of your apples slices are coated now we're going to go ahead and coat all these I'm going to pop them in the refrigerator for about I don't know 15 or 20 minutes until they're completely set and then we'll come back and we'll decorate these and we'll drizzle and we'll sprinkle and we'll make them look really fun so we'll be back when it's time to do that all right these are out of the fridge and they're ready to you know go to the next step we've got our caramel our white chocolate we have some extra of this dark chocolate if you want to stick that in a pastry bag you can but basically you know what we're gonna go ahead and do fun is we're just gonna have some fun you know and it doesn't have to be perfect it just has to be that's all if we take some of these cookie crumbs that one was just too big and we'll take some of these chocolate chips mini chocolate chips see the whole goal here is to kind of seal up the stuff you put on there with the hot the hot drizzle so then what you can do is put some caramel on there we're going to return these to the refrigerator and I love this because it's like those giant apples that you can get only there well more manageable I really like come on because you're so Hardy yes they can be super difficult I'm just gonna caramelize see how use that word now I put the caramel on these and then I'm going to drizzle these with some more of the coating chocolate but first we'll put some chocolate chips on these and you go to those expensive shops like if i go to busch gardens or something those big candy apples they're expensive they're really expensive what I'm going to do is I'm going to pop these back in the fridge and I'm going to let them solidify and when I come back I'll put them on a pretty platter and I'll show you what they look like and there you have it these just came out of the fridge and I just put them on a serving plate the caramel is going to remain sticky but your chocolate is going to firm up and kind of hold everything on there now this one unfortunately stuck to the top of the shell for the underside of the shelf above that where I'd stuck the the sheet pan to have these cool in the refrigerator so you know it happens to everybody it's just what happens so no biggie because we're just going to cut into that for you guys so you can see what it all looks like I'm sure it's going to taste delicious but I have my knife here and we'll go ahead and we'll just cut into that look at that look at that beautiful you want to bite mm-hmm-hmm not make you do a happy dance hmm that's really delicious no I use candy melts or melting chocolate you can use whatever you like you can use chocolate chips you could use tempered chocolate whatever floats your boat that's what you can use I just find the candy melts to be super easy to use and they're already tempered and you don't have to worry about temporary chocolate or anything with that so if you want to use real chocolate you should learn how to temper that my friend Gretchen over on Gretchen's bakery channel she has a great series of videos where she goes through how to temper chocolate on your own I will never attempt to do that because that is not in my wheelhouse I'm going to be very honest with you so you can make these any old way you love them you can put the things that you like on them you can dip these in white chocolate instead of dark chocolate you can put dark chocolate on the drizzle you do what you like doesn't matter it's all going to be fun and delicious one thing i will say do not make these ahead of time make them the day that you're going to eat them because these are very perishable and they don't hold very well because the apple juice will start to seep through and it will start to break down the chocolate so that's just one thing you need to know I want to thank you for joining me today so I could show you how to make these super fun apple slice pops that are covered in chocolate and all kinds of deliciousness I hope that you enjoyed it and if you did please consider giving me a thumbs up if you're not already hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out on all

lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before

apples whatever you'd like and we're gonna add in two drops of maroon just to add a little depth to our red ooh that was a big drop and now we're gonna stir everything together and now we're gonna cook our candy mixture over medium-high heat until it reaches 300 degrees so while our candy cooks we're gonna prep our apples we have six small apples here they've already cleaned the wax off of now we're gonna go ahead and take the stems off of them just give them a little twist just pop right off kind of fun you get out the kids do this the kids help you in the kitchen this Halloween and now we're gonna insert our sticks into the center of our apples just push it on in there until the Apple stays alright our Candy's reached 300 degrees meaning it's ready to use before we dip our apples in our candy coating we're gonna add some cinnamon flavor about 12 drops [Music] all right we're just gonna mix the cinnamon oil in our candy it's gonna smoke and bubble a little bit not a big deal oh my god it smells like cinnamon it's gonna be so good on our apples as soon as our candy mixture stops bubbling we're gonna go ahead and dip our apples and we're almost there so we mix in our cinnamon oil into our candy coating and we're just gonna go ahead and dip our apples into the coating make sure you get all sides lift it up and let the excess drip off and place it onto our parchment lined baking sheet easy-peasy candy apples were invented in 1908 by candy maker William W Kolb he experimented with dipping apples in a red candy mixture and sold them in a shop for five cents each since then they've been sold nationwide our cinnamon candy apples are ready to eat i coated mine and a little bit of gold leaf to make them fancy and we're gonna cut into them oh my gosh this is the only way you can eat them to just nice look at that they're beautiful just gonna cut them into nice bite-sized pieces gotta be a little forceful oh yeah is that oh my gosh is so fancy and gold leaf apples mmm these are so good the apples nice and crisp and you also get the crisp crunch of that candy coating and the cinnamon is so lovely in there oh my god YUM mmm if you love this Gary good retro recipe make sure to subscribe and have fun this Halloween [Music] [Music]", "5rQhGXp-FPk": "evening friends today we're gonna be doing a bit of a festive one for Britt so actually gauge buoys off the apples in time for bonfire night but got bit of a twist here we're actually going to be using fireball whiskey as our liquid base to get that really nice cinnamon flavor good news for my vegans out there fireball whiskey is vegan friendly so you will need castor sugar golden syrup vinegar chopsticks or thick cocktails because when we're testing the temperature of our toffee is a little trick I'll talk about in a little while this would be advantageous so then guys let's measure out our caster sugar and prepare our apples now you want to remove the stalks from the top pop them in a bowl like so and then next what you want to do is you wanna get some boiling water and cover them that's to remove the waxy coating from your apples give them a little bit of a a stir around after a minute or two drain them off and dry your apples I want to make sure the toffee sticks to our Falls that's the best way to do it by removing that waxy coating now get your cocktail sticks or weird little skewer things and pop them in the bottom of your apples just like this and then next we need to measure out our fireball whiskey try not to drink any in this process as tempting as that is so poor your fireball into a sauce pin turn on the hob and add your sugar give that a nice stir around it might take up to five minutes for that sugar to dissolve and once that started happening we're gonna need you to add in your vinegar and your golden syrup next if you don't have a thermometer the way you can tell if your toffee is ready by dropping some in some cold water if it's still sticky like that it's not ready it needs to be brittle once it's gone into that cold water okay that's how you're gonna know but I would recommend getting a thermometer then once you up to 150 degrees you want to coat your apples do be very careful that topic is scolding hot you will get burnt if any drops onto your skin if you're worried about the temperature dropping any point dude check partway through once all those apples are coated and cooled down you can try one see what you think the taste I'm a fan I hope you are too thanks for watching", "c_QijNfsbnI": "hello welcome to the gem show as you could see

"hey guys is Renee supported Isis heard I wanted to share this idea I actually sat on Pinterest but the original idea I think they used peanut butter but I will just want to go and at my shelf light of course because I love chef light so yeah I just want to share this idea but before to start don't forget to give this video a thumbs up as far as four ingredients we're going to be needing apples and I believe I used two out of these three apples kind of a two tablespoons probably I didn't age or anything but I you think this is kind of like two tablespoons of chopped nuts and then some semi-sweet chocolate I didn't make sure my chocolate as well sorry about that it was a half a bar of chocolate but you know there always depends on how much are made you want to achieve your dessert then I'm just going to be using this barbecue steaks that are really thin one of this metal table spoon the coffee scoops and some mini cupcake wrappers okay the first thing that I'm going to be doing is just cutting my Apple and using mice cube and this is reducing this metal scoop is just going to give us the perfect size and I'm just going to them place my tiny bowls we could say on this water mix that I do have a tutorial my channel is just this tiny tip it just prevents apples from browning it's pretty helpful and I'm just going to you know do that keep on doing that adding all my pieces of apples on that mixture and that video I just go more into detail on how long and what ingredients I use but then once you're ready to remove your tiny apples from your water and just you're going to place some napkins and pretty much going to stick my barbecue sticks in there and I just wanted to do that before like I let my apples right because when you put the stick on some water is going to come out of the Apple and as you notice I'm placing some BBQ sticks unlike the green part or the outside and some others like you know vice versa that's because I want to have like two options well that dries I'm just going to be working my chocolate I did temper my chef light following the instructions that come in my package but I'm just going to take my at this point barbecue sticks and my apple I'm just going to submerge the whole thing and this pretty much is the same thing as a cake pop if you have done cake pops before this is going to be like super easy and you're going to be familiar with it and I actually found it quite easier to just work with this kind of barbecue sticks rather than using the white flooded pop stick set usually people used to you know make cake pops this is much easier for me but anyways I'm just going to go ahead with my nuts and I'm just going to cover the whole thing in nuts the green part on the top I'm just going to cover everything but that part so it's going to be like showing the green part and then I'm just going to kind of remove the excess of chocolate and then I'm just going to cover everything in nuts and that goes on my cupcake wrappers as I did before my fav is chocolate and nuts but I just want to you know to give you another option of things that you can use or do think use you want to have like a table full of desserts you have more options and here I'm just showing you that you can use some sprinkles as well and just go all the way with it or just you know have the sprinkles and this is how the whole thing is going to look and it looks super cute and this way but again it's another option that I want to share and this is how the whole thing looks with white sprinkles I think this is another option a bit more elegant in my taste something a bit more Maduro maybe either milliner I just want to share this chu ideas well actually three ideas again if you don't have one to have like the cupcake wrapper showing true this is just a you know for transportation but if you want to like you know have the Apple at cities you can remove that from your cupcake wrapper so no big deal I honestly super recommend that they taste delicious and they are super fun to look at if you liked it don't forget to give me a thumbs up subscribe Michelle for more stuff and share it thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoy it with a try and I'll talk to later bye guys", "-0zK_DfLxhY": "hi I am Irish aim is a founder of our made the company dedicated to the safety of children with allergies and I have for you today a recipe that is allergy friendly this recipe contains no nuts no dairy no eggs and no blue team you got here chocolate covered APPL pops so let's get started alright so i preheated my oven or ready to 200 degrees I am now going to take a granny smith apple and I'm basically gonna take a melon baller and with a larger side I'm just simply going to push down and roll and I'm going to place the flat side of the Apple onto my cookie sheet which I covered with parchment paper as you can see okay after we rolled our Apple balls we're going to place them in the oven for just like 10 minutes until they are warm and ground looking like these are next we're going to take our popsicle stick and dip it in our allergy friendly chocolate which you can buy at any health food store these days we're going to take the popsicle stick with the chocolate push it right into our Apple ball and then take the Apple ball and dip it in our melted chocolate yum yum yum and it's very important to also get some of the excess chocolate awful do that by rolling it around like this now comes the fun part we're going to dip our chocolate covered APPL balls into sprinkles make it look really pretty and

delicious chocolate covered APPL pops for everyone to enjoy you", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this

they're the wrong color and look like they have poop coming out of them hey guys it's me Noah glue today with my good good buddy Danny McBride today we are gonna be eating more absurd terrible sounding sweet candy things for Halloween I'm pulling my finger a lot because I'm having a stroke and I hate the world I also have diabetes now so let's try some caramel apple flavored Twizzlers all right so these are filled twists because there's too much air in your candy if you don't fill your twists up and these are also according to the back they're a delicious treat that's easy to eat because mostly when I eat candy my concern is how hard it is to eat it Oh see these are this is a nice packaging this is different than I expected oh that really looks that is look at look at the end of this guy oh it's very sticky and it's super sticky that looks horrendous can you suck the caramel without eating the twizzler well I can tie this thing in a noose in my mouth I'm gonna hang you with it no they answer you cannot suck it through you know what Twizzlers make me do mmm as appreciate the texture of a Red Vine oh yeah or a super rope now there's a candy not a fan I've now even one of two and I love it I think this is one of the best candies I've ever had I'll tell you why it's so not what you expect it to me oh it's a total surprise for example it sticks to your esophagus easy to eat hey pal you're gonna make it come on this is as choking hazard as the day is long I mean this thing will stick to your throat and just not allow anything you try to eat it without using your teeth it feels like it has an adhesive on it which is so weird but I like it I think it's super unexpected like I'm expecting I don't know what were you expecting where do you find this color green in nature I would really like this candidate I recommend this and write it in this form as I'm literally like losing my mind with sugar high right now I'm crying and the tears are sweet and not salty though crying tears of sweet sweet sugar you just find him a happy boy you're good you're doing good have you ever thought about how much better your life would be if you ate this finger ball of Twizzlers caramel up I'm not gonna eat this stuff is good people walk don't run and it wouldn't be safe get this thing also it's hard to run with diabetes got this thing the one bummer about these is now what do I use a straw to drink my Coca Cola doctor such a valid point but I leave the concern that a lot of people have mm-hmm I feel awful I can feel my heartbeat through my shirt it's pushing my shirt my heartbeat right now yeah my body's like no no is that like a Halloween theme no yeah yeah my boo I feel like in addition to being a sucker for cornrows and manicured toes I'm a huge soccer for Apple stuff that's a deep valley reference I'm a holding this thing it's so sticky it's so sticky I feel like it's holding you at this I feel like this is like a collaboration between Twizzlers and 3m oh I think that I don't want to eat these anymore I think I'm done well Danny Boyle I think I'm a little tired of these things and I think that we should just just go ahead and perfect in the office let's open it up let's open it up well here's the thing that you really excited about no do you ever get worried about how you eat a twizzler but it's not filled with anything no blue Twizzlers everybody loves a twizzler they're like vacuum sealed and you're like you know what else is weird is how come my twizzler isn't green no then having a curtain and then you realize that you've been missing out it looks like it's crammed full of bean dip which is really disturbing and very sticky yeah I feel like we're so red you know that's always constants in life and I don't know about changing the co now why are these something and every good caramel apple is Apple on the outside caramel on the inside everybody knows that from here to everywhere no what is this caramel will you what planet is that cream oh look at that right does have a sort of museum putty textures right what's museum fine you know that stuff they use it museums you deliver combos yes this performance we have combos in a weird way oh god it's kind of good right I think it keeps the twizzler a little softer than normal so you know like this weird combination of terrible and kind of good right Oh see I didn't pick up on the kind of good part they go like it dude you're on the outs on this one I'm sorry clearly I actually really enjoyed this Oh fall in love with each other already oh my god you like

to my channel anything you welcome thank you so much for stopping by today we're gonna be doing some delicious candied caramel and chocolate apples so let's get started [Music] our apples and we're only gonna do that for one minute because then if you do a longer than that the Apple will get black from the inside or brownish and we don't want that then we're gonna go ahead and dry them and take the little stem off so that way it's easier to work with then imma go ahead and get some wooden skewers or you could even use lollipop sticks and I might go ahead and just stick it in the middle just make sure it doesn't go all the way to the other side of the Apple once you're all done putting your skewers or not a person takes the fun part has begun first I'm gonna start with my chocolate covered apples and I'm gonna do black cause why not black I'm gonna be using this melting chocolate pot that I got a long time at Michaels and I do use paramon crystals to thin out the chocolate because for some reason lately the chocolate has been really hard to work with so that's what I'm using then I'm just gonna go ahead and put the part a little bit to the side just tilt it to the side and just swirl the Apple in there and then just tapped out all the excess of the chocolate so that way you have extra chocolate on the bottom part of the Apple now I'm just gonna go ahead and swirl it inside some M&Ms and you are done next we're gonna be doing my favorite caramel apples imma be using a ready-to-use a caramel and i'ma leave a link down below where you can get it at this is super easy to work with all you gonna do is just put it in the pot and let them air by itself in medium heat and it's ready to use then are you gonna do it just put in your Apple swirl it around and make sure your Apple is covered up after that I'm just gonna go ahead and tap the excess kurma off so that we I don't have a lot of it on the bottom it looks all chunky you want it to look really nice and clean on the bottom and all around it because remember we eat with their eyes first and for today all I did was just get a Butterfinger cut it in pieces and cover my Apple with it after that are you gonna do is set it aside to harden and now for my kids favorite candy apples for this recipe you're gonna need 1 cup of sugar one cup of water and one cup of corn syrup oh and gifts don't forget to check out my new vlog channel where I'll be sharing my life and some more yummy recipes the link will be down on the description bar okay back to the recipe once you have everything in the pot you're gonna go ahead and just mix everything together so that way is well blend then I'm gonna be using a hot pink but you could choose any color you want then just mix the color in once you're done doing that go ahead and let it sit for 20 minutes the bubbles are going to start from going fast to going really slow once it reaches the slow bubble stage that's when it's ready if you have a candy thermometer let it reach to 250 to 300 degrees once again we're gonna go ahead and dip for apples into our candy and we're gonna cover up all of our apples just make sure you are working really fast with this because the candy will harden but in case I have been stuck over just go ahead and put it back in the stove and let it melt put it aside to harden and you are done and that's it my love's I really hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you guys did please don't forget to give me a thumbs up comment down below so that we're know that you stopped by don't forget to check out my blog channel and as always I love you guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys on the next one bye [Music] [Applause]", "poall-18jUs": "what's up guys and ghouls welcome to another episode of 31 days of vlogging today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make caramel apple bites as someone who really enjoys caramel apples but like can never bite it properly I just I don't know like it's something about biting into the caramel on the Apple and getting stuck everywhere like it's just not fun so I found this recipe and I thought wow what a great idea to like have caramel apples but like as a bite sized thing without having to do with like the apple core and like getting the caramel all over you so let's make them we're gonna try them out okay guys so all you're going to need for this recipe some sort of fruit core for apples some sort of skewer or stick and caramel bits that you can actually melt right in your microwave so after you've rinsed dried and removed the stickers from your Apple you're going to take your melon baller and we're just gonna go into the Apple and start creating little circles I do recommend going back and forth with it to get more of a round shape I'm noticing that if I only go one direction it does actually break the Apple off into a shape that's not necessarily a circle this play of apples came from three which I feel like it's more than enough to save this Apple for another time so I've taken a tray with wax paper and I'm going to start taking the apples one by one and sticking a long toothpick down inside of them and just laying them flat this is actually a good example of why it's okay to not have an apple that's completely perfectly circular because it gives it a platform on which to sit so all my apples are ready to go so at this point I just need to prepare the caramel so just kidding about the microwaving of the caramel I actually read the back of the bag here and it says to make caramel apples you're gonna add a package with two tablespoons of water to a medium saucepan and basically melt it that way now I'm just going to stir it on low heat I am going to place it in this microwave safe Bowl we're gonna work very quickly and we're just going to dip our apples in it in the caramel until the excess falls off and then place it back down where it originally was sitting I don't know if you can if you can hear like the crazy children screaming that's occurring at the pool I apologize it's so annoying I almost forgot this is an extra step that you can choose to do if you want but I really like caramel apples that have enough on them so I'm gonna take the nuts put on a bag and use something heavy kind of smash the nuts I'm using this thing you can take the crushed nuts put them in a little container I'm also gonna roll it in the nuts YUM so I don't know if you noticed but a lot of the caramel is actually dripping off of the apples so I'm just gonna kind of take my time and let the caramel kind of sit on the Apple before I actually lay it down okay so as you can see most of the caramel is actually like melted off of the apple I did look it up online and apparently this is a common problem it mainly has to do with the fact that the caramel is so hot that if you don't hold it and spin it for long enough it will actually melt off of the apples however I really don't think that it's gonna taste any different at this point I'm gonna put them in the fridge they do have to stay in the fridge for an hour and then I will try to peel them off the wax paper and hopefully they will look okay are you guys so these have been in the fridge for about an hour now as you can see the caramel did melt towards the bottom but I was able to pull it off in one piece so that's a good sign and yeah I'm gonna taste test this right now so here we go Wow world para Mali look really good I recommend I was really good I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial sorry it was like all over the place I know that I'm not like a food guru I don't make food videos often but I figured this is as real as it gets right someone who's trying something for the first time just like you probably are no big deal if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up and I will see you guys tomorrow with another 31 days of blogging video bye everyone", "898nGn68K0c": "[Music] good morning so today we've got our apples on the stick the miniature apples on a stick and I ended up having to do another batch because I waited so many trying to get the candied apples and while I'm at it I was planning on combining these two together and make them one video but the candied apple video became so long that I've decided to break it down into two videos so one for the candied apples and one for the caramel apples the process to make the apples himself free dry the apples is the same so I don't show that in this video but if you want to see that just hook up the candy apple video and it'll be in there so the first thing we got to do unwrap all these caramels I've got a one bag of crap caramels I'm gonna make it according to the instructions on the bag [Music] [Music] all right so we've got our caramels in here we're going to add two tablespoons of water turn it on medium-low heat we're just going to stir constantly it says until it's totally melted obviously there you don't want it to stick and or burn that's why you're going to stir it constantly and it's coming up getting really smooth so I'm going to take this off the heat in a second and we'll start dipping okay so in my old age I forgot to press record when I was dipping the first batch but lucky luckily enough I ran out of caramel sauce so I caught it so you'll get to see me dip some of these I don't have a lot left but well we'll get a demonstration of it anyway [Music] [Music] there you have it I'll get those in the fridge with the other ones we'll let them cool down and then get them wrapped up for the display I'll see you later okay I'm bagging these up and they were really sticky and sticking to the bags at room temperature so what I did is I stuck them in the freezer for about half an hour so I figured I'd better to let you guys know and then they go in the bag real easy now when I go to went to take them out of the little baggie at room temperature the caramel does stick to the bag of what I think you can do is keep these stored in a refrigerator until you use them and it's close to the time that you're gonna use them people cool and that way it won't be as sticky when they try to open up the wrapper and get it out but I mean it's caramel you would expect it to be sticky and no but you can do about it but I think that would help you overcome everything just freezer for half an hour so that you can bag them and go in there real easy as you see you could do it that way for storage I mean you can keep them in your vacuum sealed bag out of the refrigerator I suppose but if you're going to be using them in a display or something maybe you might want to keep them chilled and then display them as close to the time that you take them out of the refrigerator I mean you can still open them I could still open it and just when I opened it when they were at room temperature the plastic stuck to the caramel so when you pull the bag off you got strings of caramel and that kind of stuff kind of messy and then still work but I think if they were chilled and work a lot better so I thought I'd just share that with you as a graph innate almost finished this way so much easier it was almost impossible to get it in the bag when they were at room temperature steps ticking is going nice and easy I didn't freezing solid I just stuck them in the freezer for about Oh half hour 45 minutes maybe an hour all right if this all cleaned up and then we're gonna set up a pretty display and get these posted on the Internet on the YouTube just in time for Halloween [Music] you", "DV6Lm38FE3A": "this one right here is the frozen caramel apple that's right we have caramel apples but this one's frozen something a little different start with some I hit that with some caramel vodka some butterscotch schnapps some apple juice guess what you could stop here you got yourself a pretty cool drink but we can keep going Carmel syrup okay and then guess what we blend the way to create our nice caramel bottom okay fine that's our first layer let's create a green middle sour apple schnapps okay come behind that with some sour apple mix bingo alright but we're still not done it with a little bit of sweet and sour just to even everything out blend get ourselves a nice rich green put that in the middle in in a rich green kind of a poor green kind of Edward I don't know some kind of green okay I don't know it's right now until satisfactory put some more caramel on top put a Carmel caveny on top some caramel syrup on top and we're good to go okay I don't know why I'm fighting in the Carmel like that but whatever all right later", "4GVAGmaSmXs": "okay so today we're going to be making lollipops it's very simple and easy way to make lollipops using things that you can find in the shops and around your home so the basic ingredients are as follows to make this the equipment you're going to need is the first step is to put our sugar and our cream of tarter and our water into a saucepan then we simply heat it up and stir until all the sugar is dissolved now the cream of tartar is an interfering agent that will stop sugar crystals forming and hopefully leave us with a nice clear glossy lollipop at the end okay so our sugars are starting to reach a stage where it's bubbling at this point we want to pop in our sugar thermometer and turn the heat down slightly we don't want our sugar to get really hot and burn the temperature that we're looking for is hard crack and it's approximately 152 degrees Celsius now if you don't have a sugar thermometer just heat it for around 10 minutes and take little spoonfuls out as you go along and drop it into ice cold water what you're looking for is the sugar to set very hard very quickly and then be snappa ball and that's when you've reached the correct temperature odd crack what I'm going to do is take a spoonful of the mixture out and drop it into cold water now the way that it behaves once it hits the water will tell you what stage you're at if you don't have a sugar thermometer okay so just going to take a teaspoon out and drop it into the water at the moment we're not even at softball stage so it just forms a blob at the bottom and if we then stir it you can see take some of that out it's kind of just a gloopy soft sugar syrup okay so it's now reached the temperature that we're looking for and I'm going to demonstrate that by taking a spoonful and just dropping it into this cold water okay so we're just going to pop that straight into cold water and what we're looking for is for it to set hard and basically crack and it's setting in the water and when we take it out it should crack so I'm gonna take some this out it's set nice and firm you can see there and if you try and break it you'll find that it just breaks down to lots of little pieces so I'm going to pop in my yellow food coloring now a couple of drops should be more than enough try not to stir it too much at this stage because it can cause the sugar to crystallize and set very hard very quickly and then you're not going to be able to make your lollies so we're just going to get some oil onto our piece of freeze proof paper just to make sure that our lollies don't stick so we're now at the consistency we're looking for it's runny but it hopefully will hold a bit of shape when we put it straight onto our sheet you get a spoonful of the mixture just going to pop it on to our sheet there making a circle as we go just repeat this mixture should make about twenty dollies now before your mixture sets you want to make sure you take your lollipop stick just press it down as the back your lolly with a little twist and that should make sure it gets completely incorporated into a mixture so I'm popping the stick in pressing it down and just gently twisting it from side to side until the sugar covers the whole stick you can keep your lollies for two to three weeks off the day you've made them and for storing them you can need to put them making sure they're not touching between layers of greaseproof paper and airtight container and that's how to make one pops", "dbWpl1f8aLs": "hey good sweet early on the mess we fight and today we'll be making chocolate apple pies so what's good sir first what I did I just got this one chocolate chip and then keeping it warm in my fondant pot so what I did I just watched some apples I went over to drop and that is that I'm going to cut I'm going to cut them up in places okay so I'm ready but I've already got some apples and I just put that I already did too and when I dies put the popsicle sticks inside apples where I'm gonna do that if I was gonna dip them into the chocolate and now I'm gonna do I was gonna do the next one you know I'm just going to Jezebel with caramel sauce and I'm just gonna put it in the refrigerator to stop for a few minutes and I'm gonna do the rest so the chocolate is set so welcoming so now Stephanie taste test so yummy the except are you telling me coming down below do we give me a thumbs up I", "ghWeCAw2YT8": "today I'm going to be making a really simple and easy caramel sauce and here are the ingredients that we need 1 cup of regular white sugar 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream and that's 35% cream I'm using 1/3 of a cup of butter and I'm using salted butter in this recipe and a little bit of water and I'm going to be using 4 tablespoons of water so those are the ingredients so let's get started so let me go through what I've set up I have my little hot plate here which is just that element just like you would see on your stove I've got my pot and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my 4 tablespoons of water and just get that right in there and I'm going to take all of the sugar and just get that right in there just like that ok and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to gently heat this and I want to get this up to a very slow simmer and I want to actually caramelize the sugar that's in there now why did I put the water in well the water is just going to help get everything together and dissolve properly you could do this without adding water but it takes a lot longer and you could actually burn things so by adding that water in it just it acts as a little buffer between the the actual direct heat and it just incorporates everything really well so I'm going to just get this this my little hot plate here gets very hot very quickly so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to leave it there both there and I'm just going to let this go and I'm just going to let that slowly slowly very gently come up to come up to temperature so what I'm going to do is I'll pause the film for now I'll wait a couple of minutes and once it starts doing what it needs to do then I'll come back alright so I've come back and right now we can see that the sugar is really getting dissolved and I've got myself a nice wooden spoon here now you can use a whisk but I don't want you to actually whisk what you want to do is just let this go on its own so don't actually get in there with a whisk and really mix this you don't want to mix this you know you can take your whisk and just slowly move it around if you really feel the need to or what you can do is take your pawn your take your your pot rather and just go like this just move it around a little bit just like that okay we'll just let that go and what I want to do at this point you can see how quickly this is going when I paused the film before that was only about maybe a minute and you can see how quickly this goes now depending on the color of your caramel you want to really watch this because once you get it too dark then you can't go back so I'm just going to carefully watch this I don't know if the camera can pick it up but there is a slight slight little tint of caramel going on there you can see even this thing is very very powerful so I'm just going to I'm actually going to turn this thing right off for a second so now I've got it right off I'm just going to watch this you can actually see a cup change in color now so when I get it to the the actual color that I want what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the butter and I'm going to put the butter in there and the butter is going to add to add a really really rich creamy texture to our caramel but what it also will do is it will stop the cooking process because the butter is cold I'm using butter that's cold I should actually put that in the description that the butter that I'm using is cold that will drop the temperature of the the sugar so I'm just going to watch this see at this point now it's slowed its slowed right down so I'm just going to get it up to number one again and I'll just let it go a little bit longer all right so what I'm going to do is I'll just pause the tape for about maybe 30 seconds or so and I'll come back alright so this is about a minute later I said 30 seconds but I let it go for about a minute and you can see now I'm not well hopefully you can see that it's really starting to get that caramel color and this is really where you want to build up your flavor profile because if you don't let this portion go at this this step if you don't let this go long enough you're not really going to get that true caramel flavor you really need you know the the sugar to really caramelize and now you can really see that coming up coming together I had also turned on my heat I'm actually going to turn that down now I've got it right off now and now right now I'm really starting to pick up just for the first few seconds right now I can smell the caramel there we go and that's good perfect you can see that's changing color very quickly now so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take all of my butter and just get that in there okay now I've got my heat off now you can take that right off the heat just like that get that in there and then what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take our heavy whipping cream and I'm just going to get that in there as well and at this point you can stir stir stir so I'll get my wooden spoon in there and you may have to introduce heat depending on your stove but I don't need to there's a lot of heat going on here still you can still see it that it's very very hot even with the addition of the cold butter and the cold cream so at this point I'm just going to gently mix this if you don't have a wooden spoon you can use a regular spoon you can use a fork you can you know whisk if you have one you can really see that beautiful caramel color coming together now oh well that smells so good now if you're wondering yes you could add a little bit of vanilla so you don't want to add too much in because you don't want it tasting too much like vanilla so maybe a half a teaspoon of vanilla if you really like vanilla then you can put in a whole teaspoon you could have added it to your cream before you added it and mix that together first doesn't really matter and there we go mm-hmm Oh smells so good I hope the camera can pick up the nice color that is beautiful I actually know some people once it's actually harden they might actually take a spoon and maybe sneak a little spoonful from time to time not going to mention any names yes I'm talking about myself but at this point I'm just going to add a little bit more heat into this so just let it come up just to a little simmer and then I'm going to turn it off and then we're finished could you stop it right now yes you could because as this cools down it is going to thicken quite a bit I just want to give it a little bit of heat just so that I know everything is you know nicely combined a little bit of heat really helps do that just brings it together then those final stages there you can see the bubbles are starting there we go just breathe a little bit of life into all the you know ingredients just to kind of give them that last little spark just before we let it cool down I just look doesn't that look great at that point I'm turning it off and that is it and now what we'll do is we'll just let this cool and then you can pour it into a jar and store it in the fridge so I'll come back a little later on when this is cooled down so what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove from the heat I'm actually going to go put it on like real stove which is off and I'm just going to let this cool down and I'll show you the final product a little later on alright my caramel sauce has cooled down considerably and I just wanted to show you how amazing this looks I wish you could smell this it is just amazing stuff look at this the next time you go to the grocery store check out how much a bottle of caramel sauce costs and look what we made it for practically nothing compared to what you pay for it in the store and this is homemade all-natural and look at that amazing so let's just get some of this caramel right into my little serving dish oh I wish you could smell this it just smells amazing so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up this is my homemade caramel sauce that's it for this video so I'll see you next time you", "P5TPf7H2o1M": "hi guys we're back and we're doing a candy this chocolate apple and it's gonna be Mickey Mouse for Halloween so start with a dipped caramel apple you guys want me to show you how to do this that's fine but just leave me comments otherwise just dip your Apple I'm in caramel and then you're going to take two marshmallows and you're gonna put some melted chocolate and on each side one on on each side and you're gonna place those in there let it harden in the refrigerator once that's done you're gonna take some melted chocolate chocolate like I have here and bear with me because I've only melted a limited amount of chocolate to do this and this is my second take on the video but anyway so what you're gonna do is you're going to melt your chocolate or dip your Apple in your chocolate but when you do this at home guys you want to make sure that you melt enough chocolate to truly dip your Apple right otherwise it's not going to work out very well you're gonna be disappointed with the results so it's worth taking that extra little bit of time and you're melting enough chocolate to do this the right way so I'm gonna just get his ears a little better here but when you do this at home you're not gonna have this problem because you're gonna notes don't be chintzy with the chocolate beach in June with Mickey Mouse as errors all right if you guys have been following me on YouTube we got a lot of Mickey Mouse stuff going on but I'm gonna tell you this stuff is adorable you could do this for Halloween you can do it for a kid's birthday party as party favors really for for anything and these are adorable and once you haven't it see how cute he is though you can't beat him I'm gonna plate once you haven't dipped he looks like that you're gonna put him in there for George or because I'm cool I already have one ready to go and he is right here he's so cute anyway you're gonna take him and I don't want to use the same plate so I'm here on the counter but once you have him ready to go you're gonna take some melted white chocolate just like your melted chocolate spoon you are going to melted but I know when you're gonna do this you're gonna melt more now you need red sprinkles you need yellow jelly beans I don't have jelly beans and we know that I like to take whatever I have and make it work so I have some yellow tootsie rolls and I have just cut them or molded them into little rounds circle things for his buttons okay but what we're gonna do first we're going to take our chocolate Mickey Mouse and we're gonna dip him into our white chocolate we're not gonna do the whole Mickey Mouse we're only gonna do half a Mickey okay and we're gonna have our red sprinkles ready dyes because we are going to make sure it's kind of even all there I'll Mickey I wanted to look cute once he's done you are going to you're gonna shake your red sprinkles make sure I don't have a warrant I've been working today to know we are going to a problem I had earlier guys we're trying to pick him up I know he's just gonna want to brake on me so anyway we're gonna shake our red sprinkles try not to touch the sprinkle jar make sure you guys have sturdy sticks because if you doubt another thing bro all right but don't be shy on the sprinkles either all right so there he is now mmm yes now we are going to take and we're gonna set him down on the plate just for the sake of setting him down and we are going to apply his little buttons that I made earlier yes yes I know they're gonna have sprinkles on them anyway but you're just gonna place another see got the cutest thing in the world that is so

you got these are cute I'm gonna come back with some other ones too because I think you guys are really going to like these anyways until next time and thanks for watching", "7Q9f7rpc8Rs": "I have already washed and scrubbed these apples and I'm going to use skewers here as my sticks you can use chopsticks if you want you can use popsicle sticks really whatever kind of stick will go into the center of an apple and just try and get it down through the center of said apples like that and then I have some boiling water here that I have used to test my candy thermometer because I'm going to be making the caramel from scratch and to help the caramel sit or set or stick stick on the apples you want to dip your apples in this boiling water for maybe 5 10 seconds or so and this removes all the wax that is on the apples just go ahead and dip them in there for 5 seconds or so and then dry them off and that gets all the wax off like that now that the apples are dipped and are off to the side I've got some wax paper here on my cutting board if you have parchment paper you can use that whatever you use you want to liberally butter with a lot of butter if you think you have enough butter on there put some more and this will prevent the caramel from sticking to this and you just want to make sure that this is liberally coated with butter all right now let's get working on the caramel for the caramel I'm going to add my brown sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan you want the heaviest pan you can possibly find that you have available to you I'm going to add in my corn syrup and I'm just doing a half a recipe here for demonstration purposes I will put the full recipe down below process is the same corn syrup in there and my butter and finally my sweetened condensed milk and I'm just going to bring this up to a boil over medium-high heat and once your butter is melted all the way go ahead and put in a candy thermometer and make sure that the bottom of the candy thermometer does not touch the pan that will give you a false reading and I'm going to turn the heat down to just above medium here and be sure to keep stirring this you do not want this to burn and every once in a while scrape down the side that's why I'm starting this with a silicon spatula scraping down the sides will prevent your caramel from becoming grainy so I'm going to bring this up to a boil and I'll be back this is nearly at a boil and I'm continuing to stir this and scraping down the sides moving the thermometer out of the way so I can get back behind there and underneath it and you want to bring this up to the recipe says 248 degrees I find that to be a little hard for caramel apples so I'm going to bring it up to 245 degrees and just keep stirring this even walking away for five seconds is enough for it to burn so you definitely do not want to burn it so I'm going to keep on cooking this until we are at 245 degrees looks like right now we're just approaching 210 so we got a little bit ways to go all right this right here is right about 245 degrees so that's what it looks like when it's done again just keep stirring because you do not want this to burn I'm going to take this off heat and over here I'm going to let this sit for just a few minutes before I add my vanilla now I'm going to add my vanilla like that throw this in and now it is time to dip our apples now you want to get your apples dipped before this has a chance to cool too much so I'm just going to roll the Apple in like that let most of that caramel come off like that and I'm going to roll these in crushed peanuts chopped peanuts if you don't want to do peanuts you don't have to I just kind of like the way they look so and taste so I'm going to dip them like that and set this off on your buttered wax paper now let me get the rest of them finished and for the rest of the caramel that you don't use for dipping your apples sorry about pumpkin bumping you there I just sprayed some nonstick spray there on this granite slab and I'm just going to pour this caramel right out like that and just let this cool slice it up wrap it in wax paper if you so choose and there's some thermal candy for you so that's how you make caramel from scratch and candy apples caramel apples sorry hope you enjoy thanks for watching you", "fQQLCMGRlQE": "  - [Narrator] As a local\nreal estate company we know it's not just a house that makes a home. Which is why we are always\nlooking for the best services, the tastiest foods, and the\nmost memorable activities that make us proud to\ncall our community home. Every week we feature local\ncompanies and communities that add exceptional value\nto the cities of Salt Lake in Utah valley. This is Valley Vibes. - So you have all these awesome flavors. What's your most popular, what's your, your best selling apple. - It's the apple pie. That's this one right here. So this apple here is\nrolled in cinnamon sugar and then it has a vanilla\nchocolate on the top. And then you bite into it, and you taste that sweet,\nsoft, chewy caramel. You can taste it. People have said, oh that\nis just like an apple pie. - Mm\n- So that's why we chose to call it that. - Well will you teach\nme how to make that one? - Yeah, would love to! We'll have to go back in\nthe kitchen to do that. - Okay let's do it. - Alright. - Okay, wow this is neat. - So, on the caramel apple\na lot of people will ask me, how do you get it to\nnot run down the apple? Well, first of all, you\nhave to work with a caramel that you make from scratch. Because if you just melt\ndown the little caramels-- - So you don't just unwrap\na bunch of little things? - No.\n(laughs) No.\n- That just shows my skills. - And you have to shake off the excess because you don't want it\nto puddle a whole bunch at the bottom. And then we give it a little, you know, we just kind of slide it off the sides so that it doesn't have\nthat puddling at the bottom. - Look at that.\n- This is the cinnamon sugar, and then we just roll it in that. And then we let 'em cool. And then after we're done with them, my husband goes back and\nputs the chocolate stripes and we'll be showing you\nthat a little bit later. - Cool, cool. So do you always use green apples? Are these Granny Smith? What are they?\n- Yes. - The reason that we do that is because we love the tart\napple with the sweet caramel, it's a perfect combination. We actually get them\nfrom Mountainland Apples down in Santaquin. - Oh so you're a total local company here. - Yes.\n- That's neat. - And we're big on, we test\nevery apple that comes through. Or every batch I should say. Not every apple cause you know we're not gonna\n- You don't eat every apple? - Take a bite out of every apple. - I'm the apple tester. - To us, to bite into a caramel apple, where the caramel is so delicious but then you bite into a soft, mushy apple that's gonna take away.\n- Ruins it. - It's gonna ruin it.\n- Yeah. - So here, let's let you have a try. - Okay. Here we go, here we go. - All the way.\n- Go all the way? Oh all the way in?\n- Don't be afraid. - Okay, so then we scrape it off. - Mhm. - Okay, and then we dip. - Yeah, just roll it. - Well,\n(laughs) - You just kinda wanna do it gentle - Well, there ya go. There ya go. Look at that, so pretty. - Just set it down right there. - Let's just do a little\ncomparison on that. (light music) What else makes you guys special. - Well quality is big for us. We want our customers to keep coming back. So we've chosen to make\nour caramel stove-top. We don't use machines. We've found that a doubling\nor tripling the batch just changes everything. We want that old-fashioned flavor. But touch the top and you'll see it's not a sticky caramel.\n- Oh yeah. - No it's not. - It doesn't stick to your teeth, it doesn't pull any of your teeth off. It's very soft and very chewy. And that's what makes it so delicious. So I think I've dipped all that I can dip. - Once the apples have cooled down, - Okay. - Then we melt this chocolate\nand I put all of it on, and this is the method I use. I just go back and forth. - Wow. - I do it on all four sides. - Oh, one by one. See I would think like,\n- oh yeah. - You could just keep 'em on there\n- oh I've had - And just go.\n- dreams of making a machine that would do this for me but I haven't figured that out yet. (laughs) - Alright okay, so we're\ngonna do the one that I dipped so that's why my crumble's\nnot quite as pretty. But, do I scoop it or just lift it? - I just dip it in like\nthat and then pull it up and then just drizzle. - Okay. - Yup. (laughs) You like more chocolate on yours. - There ya go.\n- So now the challenge is is to guess which one I did\nand which one you did, right? - Wait, that's a better side, right there. See, mines the turtle, right there. - One of the things\nthat our customers love, when we go to an event to sell is that we slice the apples for them. That way, you don't have to worry about getting all sticky on your face. Not that it's a sticky caramel but still it's sugar and\nit's going to create-- - It's not as awkward, like... - Exactly, it's not awkward.\n- Yeah. - So we slice for them. But I want you to go ahead and try that, tell me what you think.\n- Okay let me try one. Cause I'm gonna get a corner. - So that opens up into\neight slices actually. - Look at that. Oh yeah. - Okay let's try, this is the apple pie. - The apple pie. - You're right. It tastes just like an apple pie. But with the cinnamon, and the chocolate, and the caramel. And the tartness of the apple. - Its a perfect combination.\n- I'm sorry, I'm just like, enjoying it so much so... It's fabulous, I love it.

and with all of us we've already tasted these Courtney's candy apple pops and we're big fans they're so good it's great to have you with us it's got to be back yeah I'm glad you're here too so you took kind of the caramel apple idea and turn it into a little pop exactly it's just like a big slice of apple and you don't have to have that big huge bite when you go into it yeah yeah I think these are really fun so we've already sliced up our apples right and so if you want to if you're going to do like the little exposed pops on the edges soak these in lemon water for about five minutes so they don't Brown but otherwise if you're just going to coat them in chocolate go ahead and get poppin okay so grab your knife go ahead and find the bottom there cut you a little slice and you're using like popsicle sticks to go inside right right found these great big tongue depressors always one side a tongue depressor okay you just stick that right in yes just cut right in there good and you're ready to get decorating so grab you can use the candy melt like we use with the cake pops or if you want if there's a favorite flavor of chocolate chip you have these are cinnamon so they're perfect for seasonal oh yeah that smells really good too so you just melt those in the microwave just melt those in the microwave and then because they're so thick add a little bit of coconut oil to them okay and that melts right up that melts right up it'll blend it'll help get it a little bit thinner you don't want it too thin or it'll be running it won't stick to your pot very well but you see how it just automatically kind of melts in there yeah okay that's cool i'm liking this already all right so once you get it completely covered then you can just decorate it to your heart's content exactly kinds of things you're using for decorating well today I brought with me just some pretty colored sprinkles we got some big chunky ones there's the little glittery ones you can do whatever you want I've done ones with crushed-up cookies crushed up graham crackers and marshmallows all your favorite candy nuts whatever you want to do all right so I'm going to live that one right there and perfect it to decorating here you've got these cute little leaf sprinkles I think those are pretty yeah perfect for the season I've got some caramel here if you want me to drizzle some on that yeah that'd be good so the secret to drizzling is just kind of going over the sides exactly and then back and forth the best place to do this especially if you're with kids is over the sink but if not just wipe down your counter afterwards oh that's so pretty be good to go you can do the little ones too on the little sticks and you can make them into shapes ya like it you had a cookie cutter that had maybe an acorn shape or a ghost or whatever you just cut the Apple out and put it on a smaller pop right and go to town yeah do the one that's the end piece start on this side because otherwise you'll break it going the other way oh that's a good idea ok so you're going to go right through the skin right this game's kind of holding it together that's great so that's how we could make a ghost maybe you're a ghost this was a little pumpkin those are so cute and I love the way you've displayed them over here you've got a cutout pumpkin with styrofoam in the center and you just display the pops right in there that'd be perfect for a fall harvest party halloween party whatever exactly whatever you want to make it so cute Courtney thanks for this great idea no problem I know the crew is ready to dig right into these and I think we will right after the show's over we're going to post all the steps and ingredients online after the show at newschannel 5.com just click on the talk of the town section", "TC4q3ZuQNyc": "[Music] how to make caramel apples among the best treats you can enjoy in the fall or caramel apples the light and crunchy fruit contrasts beautifully with the rich sweetness of caramel you will be surprised to learn how easy it is to make such a decadent dessert so easy that decorating the caramel apples can be quite an entertaining activity for the whole family in fact all you need to do is gather up the ingredients set them up and make one caramel apple as an example for your family to follow then you can take the rest of the afternoon off it will be so much fun they'll be glad to take over the kitchen in your place are you longing to take a long luxurious bath while everybody else gets busy making these yummy concoctions here's how one choose the freshest apples that you can find especially if you are making them ahead of time caramel apples can only be as good as the apples they can actually keep for as long as a week when stored at room temperature as long as they are uncut Granny Smiths are perfect for this recipe because their tartness provides a nice contrast to the caramel too to prepare caramel coating for five to six medium sized apples put the following ingredients together one fourteen ounce package of caramel candy or caramel bits two tablespoons of milk assorted nuts and candies for sprinkling some melted chocolate for drizzling and six craft sticks three prepare the apples first most apples that you buy at the grocery are coated with wax which will keep the caramel from sticking unless you are sure that you are using uncoated apples you will have to dip each one in very hot water to melt off the wax before wiping it dry keep the apples in the fridge to cool them down and remember to transfer them into the freezer for 30 minutes before coating them with caramel stripping off the wax and then getting the apples as cold as possible should help get a nice thick coat of caramel to stick to each Apple for as for the nuts and candies which you intend to sprinkle over the caramel make sure to crush them into small pieces first pieces as big as regular M&Ms will just slide off some suggestions for toppings follow almonds slivered ones are perfect Oreos candy sprinkles crushed pretzels if you are looking for a more complex flavor have some fine kosher salt on hand sprinkle just a little on the caramel coating and you've got salted caramel 5 take the apples and remove their stems right where the stem should be stick the craft sticks a good way in to give you a firm grip on the apples 6 place some wax paper on top of a large plate or tray and coat lightly with a nonstick spray this will hold your apples after coating prepare the caramel 7 take the caramel candy and place it in a double boiler as it heats stir it constantly pour in 2 tablespoons of milk and a pinch of salt continue until the caramel has completely melted and start coating the apples turning as you go in order to get every inch covered if you need use a spoon to help get the caramel where you want it hold the Apple right above the pot of caramel to catch the drips and then proceed to roll or sprinkle your nuts and candies onto it work quickly before the caramel sets pressing the topping slightly to help them stay on 8 set the finished Apple on the wax paper repeat until all the apples are done and store them uncovered in the fridge depending on how pretty you want your caramel apples to be you may want to check them from time to time and tweak them some caramel will drip down taking the toppings along with it when ready to serve lift the apples from the wax paper and trim a little of the pooled caramel off if you need to it's pretty easy to learn how to make caramel apples as you make different batches you will undoubtedly refine your technique with a little attention to detail you could even end up with caramel apples as beautiful those sold in upscale candy shops [Music]", "3qL3INfmWsw": "what's up YouTube I have been having so much fun making candy apples for the past trying to get this just just making big mistakes trying different things out you know got that boom ahead like summed up anything here I haven't made one r6e rolls the tootsie roll let me tell you about the tootsie roll the tootsie rolls Art's are kind of hard but soft but once you heat a suit see roll it turns into hard candy like it was like like those big candy apples but hard like that I'm a jolly rancher ones I'm gonna post in the video those videos I'm gonna show shots of those two clips of that in the video I made some Jolly Rancher ones I mean sit zero and Cicero chocolate and walnuts but I had put it in the food processor and I I made like a nut dust for that and so yeah I've just been having a lot of fun I was only making like two of them at a time because I couldn't eat them all but I'm gonna put this in the microwave for 30 minutes [Music] okay icebox these are room temperature apples you want to work with room temperature I find out that's better because once you get the wax off these apples are these apples are going to be better to be used room temperature when you see me do all of this but there is a wax on these apples that I have to get off and I already had me some hot water right here but candy apple sticks and I like to use the small apples because I just feel like this if it's too big you can't even get it in your mouth you can't bite it right and I'm turning them all upside down stick them in the bottom straight up like that sometimes the Apple is to the side a little bit I still go straight down with it and the reason I'm putting this just sticks in so that I have better control over the apples I can get them out of that have water turn them around a little bit like that I'm gonna show you how I do that too gotta be perfect everything that I did was sometimes I like symmetry okay barium did you see that and just going to put them in side the hot water twist them around like this that still way to get the not boiling water just simmer water it's turning so you can make sure you get all of that wax off they put the wax on there to keep to protect the skin of the Apple and to make it shine I think there's the same stuff that they make the vaporizing liquid out of full grey petroleum something like that pick out the name yeah but this is probably the same stuff I just turn into these are going to both be toppings I made that Jolly Rancher with the chamoy on it that was freaking that was an experiment [Music] got this quickly don't grab me by the stick anymore and when you're drawing it off just get on get all of that off clean that belly button Thanks okay do that I'm gonna pause the video came back this is what the caramel looks like after I melted it for one minute this is what I'm what it's got here okay so I'm give it a stir and I'm stirring it with the same the same stick that you use for the apples and I can leave the stick in there I just went and got me a cook my cookie sheet and put hey zip lock bag on there okay and get the toppings ready to go you need to be a little careful because this caramel can turn into a candy so you take the Apple just like that and deep into the next and want to press some go ahead and press that in there so that it gets on there all the way you're gonna place it the wax just get another one up in here a little slow roll is good use the stick to to just pull some of that off didn't go into these things right here I know I was thinking about [Music] and this doesn't have to be on here our perfect because it's going to be covered up with your topping or whatever you want on the Apple this is more so like a glue and at this point it's had enough okay gotta pop this in the microwave for a few more seconds to give okay what I'm gonna do is is just go ahead and place those in the refrigerator but you can start hardening up [Music] running out toppings stopping practicing y'all a nice little these peanut butter Wednesday Mills this is a peanut butter and chocolate put that in the in the freezer you see if I get some more areas when you over boy when you overheat it it turns into that phone and it gets on all on the sides and that's what just happened here so you are no keep a close eye on and I believe also the even is caramel right here can go into a heart a heart stage where it's just it's gonna turn to hard caramel most companies when they do that they don't work with this very little bit amount that I have I mean they have big huge pots of this come on they can just dump it in there boom and then roll it in a big huge pan it just makes it easier when you've got so much more we scrape it o to make these today Pynchon Pynchon violet got that caramel I noticed when I made that jolly rancher I turned out I pretty much cooked the Apple that that sugar was so hot the Apple was like the first layer of the Apple was really really like translucent it had cooked it you see these peanut butter ones too fast but they taste amazing it Apple come on yellow had a peanut butter and Apple sandwich with chocolate and caramel oh I was supposed to put them stop in so you see that I went straight into my mouth my bad I'm supposed to go on an apple this one's gonna be this was still like me alright so dad I got to put their three pathetic apples with nothing what can I do I'm gonna I'm gonna put all these up here in the caramel see what that did [Music] that's all I wanted was to get it in the center gonna watch this I'm not gonna add any little water so I'm not gonna add water to the park and ease I got y'all I got you [Music] that blue is so strong I said that in the other video with the blue color so it means good ground wasting time with that I gotta get this try to get this code they're gonna have something on them right now look at the rhyme the last hand-me-down and this stuff really don't stick so everything you know these all you need to do is soak these bowls in a little water it will dissolve this sugar no time Oh d-man it tastes good too this tastes pretty here's a little sour caramel what's up YouTube just wanted to be a very fun video as you can see I have a bunch of things I thought I was gonna be using that but I'm trying to do all that making some karma but yeah I have all the stuff to make a candy apple which is gonna be my very first time making candy apples I got the apples and these are not really big ones because it's a lot of candy it's gonna be a lot of sugar and these are just the right size proportion-wise the smaller apples a little bit it might even be tart and I liked sour and sweet so I got me some Jolly Ranchers that I'm going to be using for the candy three flavors I didn't have enough of the blue so let me just add these these four that they would be in real sheisty with those so I'm gonna mix all of those in there and then have this flavor I thought there's some sets of rules or I was thinking maybe I can melt that down and make like just like I would just like even do chocolate so tootsie roll candy apple who doesn't like peanut butter and chocolate so I got the peanutbutter morsels right here I might even much go in there and separate the chocolate from the peanut butter and play around with that - got my stick I got my nuts so yeah let's get started with this video I think then I'm gonna do this I've seen people do it on YouTube did a little research they took these Jolly Ranchers and they melted it in the oven but I'm seeing a kid melt melt them in the microwave I think that would be a lot easier but first I'm gonna have to unwrap all of these wow that came out really good it's got the chamoy all around just like like this Mexican candies bet you see here it zeroes I liked it see little I like the flavor this that like chocolate chocolate so touchy little champion [Music] this is my first time trying to go the one thing is you kind of want all of this to be ready because this candy is not going to wait for you so 4:01 got away you know how I'm using these little small apples there's a lot of Tanjung and I've had big candy apples I couldn't even bite the damn thing let's hope it just sticks on it cost me $1 and there they are made for candy apples they even gave you a picture of candy apples on it what it looks like I'm babbling I'm gonna take this stick and stir it up I'm not gonna use metal I'm gonna just use this stick just stir it up it's very hot right now and stirring it up like this looks like it's gonna melt it for me so the next time I hit it with some heat it should we go far for the board and I'm gonna leave the stick right up in there it can be my plane [Applause] don't be scared to put it in there you almost want to press it in there firm so they can get into the chocolate kisses on them this is trying to seize up already then that are cold so they work against you too walnuts and caramel got wrinkles good well thanks everyone for watching please give me a comment subscribe so you can always catch to see so you can always see what I'm doing next you know because I'm having a lot of fun doing this thanks a lot for watching", "L3weWTcMMDM": "ok now I'm going to show you the process that I used to caramelize apples so your caramel is ready to take the apple out of the fridge turn your pot to the sides that you can get most the Apple in I actually have a fan you twist the caramel so it falls off and i use the fan to cool it i'm going to let it drip down for a little bit and then i'm going to pull it up like this if you look closely i don't know if the camera oh look at that i'm a new cameraman you can see the caramel sliding down so once you start to see it slide you can kind of flip it back over the other way and you're going to see it start to set and then without showing me in the picture you're going to go over to the freezer stick it right down on your pre greased cookie sheets or cake sheets or whatever you got and if your pan is not level they will slide together my plans not level there you go there's your caramel apple covering that's it", "sR00_h-8pUs": "hey I'm done back at the candy cauldron at Disney springs with our favorite confectioner Matt to learn how to make the classic Mickey Apple we're going to take a green granny smith apple and then we're going to dip it into our caramel we're going to leave about a quarter size of green at the top this is so that the camera doesn't try to use out of the top of the Apple once we cover in chocolate and people could find recipes for caramel anywhere online right exactly and we're online use your favorite caramel you can even buy premade caramel wraps and just wrap that Apple with that so after I get enough shaken off and just going to wipe it I'm going to take a marshmallow here I'm going to trim off about a quarter maybe a little less to get a nice shape here I'm gonna find one about the same size and shape I'm going to place them a decent distance apart because you don't want to be too close together it's too much like a bunny too far apart he's like a bear and you have me just right he's a mess I'm going to carefully dip them into our chocolate go ahead and slip pointy right there now we're just going to shake it so we get a nice coating you should get ghost that chocolate what's the guests reaction to the treats you have here because they're pretty adorable they are when they see us dipping one like that they're like why if all the chocolate but you know they are there and be excited to see everything to make here we get hundreds of pictures taken every day so now if you had a little bit of skirt on our Apple you can stick some scissors and trim that off and then we're going to take it off for a white chocolate so this makes the sugar pop very well so like we can put like a primer on a coat of paint I'm going to keep spinning the apples I get even line all the way across if you're just melting this in a pot when that's not spinning you just go straight in and straight out now here we have some jelly beans these are just yellow jelly beans and we're going to put too long it's kind of like a pause sign you want to go just like an eighth of an inch below the top a line directly in the middle we're going to cover the top of the chocolate first at the first place it's going to dry and then I sprinkle the rest now the reason why we're sprinkling is because if you go straight into the sugar he's going to punch off the sugar it's not globally so this way nice and presentable and that's it that's Mickey thank you so much Matt for teaching us how to make a Mickey Apple definitely tune into the Disney parks blog next week where we'll teach you how to make the shops number one seller here's a hint it's not Mickey Mouse", "FiOI8mZDx2I": "we're away from work back oh oh god I'm going to be testing the stability features of the iPhone 4s is it's like running a race he's like ah well I can't talk with you know what she said Oh God youtube oh we're candy apple I'm working and he's putting this tape back in his mouth he's going back from okay I guess", "EijoofqO3Gc": "[Music] okay so today we're going to be making candy apples and this is my version of the Jolly Rancher flavor of candy ass if I'm making a smaller batch here so I have my two cups of sugar here and you want to make sure you have a heavy durable pot as well because that's going to make all the difference to keep that candy at a certain temperature once it's cooked in and also to get the Apple that you desire as far as you know the presentation you also need a thermometer a candy thermometer this can be used for multiple things but you can also use we use for candy I also have a measuring cup here which and you'll also need one of these durable spoons here as well master green I want more like a light green so I'm going to be using a combination of both here so first we're going to get started here on the mixture here so give me just a moment so I'm back I had to get some stuff together I realize I didn't have here okay so I got everything I had to get my darling Ranchers these are the green apple flavor and sometimes they can some one can be a little sticky I'm use granulated sugar and kind of stir them up in there leave green and lemon yellow here by Chef master and I use a combination of both since I'm going to shift now so sometimes I use a mirror color I really don't have a preference and I also have a lorry and tropical punch flavor for the candy apple and so I'm getting a mixture here together so I have my two cups of sugar 1/2 cup here of light corn seer or the candy apples and this is for the mixture I'm going to be cooking on the stove and so it gets to 300 degrees and make sure it gets to that temperature but before I get to that to me so here's my 1/2 cup of water here and also I'm going to add in my chef master color for the Apple I wanted to be like I'm really pretty pretty almost like a neon color dream so I'm going to use a combination of both the green and then the lemon yellow just to give it a little kick as far as colors I'm sorry use like my TSP manager and I always like to start as small as possible in add more if necessary so kind of get so this is 1/4 a teaspoon and you really normally you know you don't need much that's a little DAP [Music] yeah and I could say you start small and you build from there because you don't want to overpower it and not achieve the color color that you want so this is best and you won't so just start started until it's evenly mixed and one of the things you always want to make sure you shake it really well which I didn't do but that's a side note I always make sure you shake very well vigorously so that you get so I'm just going to stir this really well before pudding and also another thing you want to make sure you've got a heavy pot this is a heavy durable pot because it's going to be key and making sure you achieve and maintain the heat to cook the Apple as well as dip the Apple it's pretty although I wanted a lot lighter and so you see what I mean as far as going with less is best damn and you can't stir too much as far as when it's not only eating of course but just so lowdown white again I'm trying to get right some neon colors here so this is basically just lifting the color so to speak okay so I had to add just a little bit more of the white so here we are kind of got where I needed to be and so now then I've served this now I'm going to put this on the stove and the reason I like to use this when it's adjustable you don't want to put it all the way down to the bottom of the pot you basically want to clip it so it still has room because you want to get a good temperature for where your candy is so you don't let just cook to about 200 and I'll say about 220 about 220 and then put the flavor in there which is going to be the Lorien tropical punch for the Jolly Rancher okay so while that mixture is cooking to about 220 and preppies as well because I didn't tell you guys about this you're going to need the candy apple bamboo lollipop sticks get out six okay so also [Music] [Music] so take these out and just wipe them off and like I said I use a combination of lemon juice and distilled white vinegar that's what I prefer and basically I don't blow them or anything like that because I don't want to I want to be able to preserve the Apple in his beautiful color and I don't like walling so what I'm gonna do is put them in in my kitchen sink and run hot water until it's full to the top and where the can be this Spence over in there and covering the Apple basically and in other words submerged in there and with Indiana but in my four to five tablespoons of lemon juice and also about three tablespoons of vinegar as well and I allow those who sit and that and here's my pan also I'll make sure so also you want to set that Apple down and gently see this but you want to set it down just press you know want to go all the way down you just want to go down far enough and so if you set it down then you've got a perfect connection with that next one and it was some beautiful apples you want to make sure that you have so that Apple doesn't come off also now that you have the apples another thing that I do here basically I just want to make sure to go around here make sure because sometimes it forms a little juice so do that here but you want to make sure that you don't have any juice sitting on top these are fresh apple and another thing I use this that's another thing I'll tell you I use this and once I get my apples I use this I don't have to worry about them sticking or I don't have to worry about his friend these are ready just like to shake it off and you'll see some bubbles all right that's good [Music] that is a pretty ass and these are larger apples then the smaller ones I made a small batch with the two cups of sugar you", "xnBcxuRk_jE": "Howdy folks how is it going welcome to my\nvirgin kitchen it is Barry here, today I am showing you how to make some awesome homemade\ncandy apples they are so so good and the only restriction is your creativity my friends\nso lets show you how to make these, hit pause on the video now write all of these ingredients\ndown, nice simple recipe for you to do so you can just crack on and make them lets do\nit. So what you want to do with your bamboo skewer\nis insert it into your apple of choice, I went for a nice pink lady today which can\nbe used in different contexts I\ufffdm sure my favourite apple is a golden delicious if you\nare interested, let me know your favourite apple down below if you want to talk apples\nthat is fine. So put them on a tray with some baking paper,\nleave them there for the moment and now we will make our filling which is the dangerous\nstep in to the saucepan combine your water with the sugar now that is quite a lot of\nsugar right there I am not going to lie in fact it is like the whole population of sugar,\nbut that is why it is sticky and naughty indeed my friends so lets just go with it then we\nare going to add in our corn syrup if you cannot get hold of corn syrup it is quite\nhard to get hold of in the UK, I am using this as a pointing stick, use some golden\nsyrup or liquid glucose now liquid glucose is a little bit thicker so use slightly less,\nany questions let me know down below I will try and answer them stir them together over\na medium flame, at first it will be quite cloudy but what you want to do is dissolve\nthat sugar so keep going with that heat you really want to do this with a thermometer\nyou want to get it up to 300F and once it is at the point you want to take it off the\nheat, it is going to be really bubbling and dangerous so be super careful! Let it stand there briefly before tipping\nin the cinnamon and mixing it through now that will give it a really Autumn spicy feel\nin there so so good, I am going to love it like squirrels in the tree, leaves falling\noff the tree you know what I mean that warm and cosy autumn feel but anyhow we can now\nadd in our food dye this is where you can personalise it, I have seen a lot of people\ndoing black ones or even glitter ones I just went for a little bit of food dye to really\ndarken that up mixed it through and it is time to dunk our apples. Dunk your apples very carefully into the pan\nbefore resting on the tray be very careful with that it will be hot you can double dunk\nit if you want and then guys you can slam on your creativity hat. Do whatever you want I melted up some chocolate\ngiant food style, put some nuts on one, some shimmery glitter on the other nuts on a solo\ncandy apple white chocolate with some bannoffe pieces and also dyed my white chocolate orange\nto make a shimmery nutty one too but it is completely up to you what you want to do,\nand I hope you agree they look pretty darn gorgeous. Guys that is naughty I just took a bite out\nof this one they have that candy surrounding the apple very sticky and naughty the sweetness\nwhen you bite into them and I went for the chocolate nut one which looks like Justin\nTimberlake with the curly hair blonde thing going on so that is it then guys if you do\nhave a go, send me a picture @myvirginkitchen do invest in a thermometer makes it so much\neasier. Give this video a thumbs up, subscribe and\ncomment, I am now going to eat the Justin timberlake apple. Cheers!", "MUYnM99ORsY": "today Kevin and I are gonna try the Jolly Rancher French into two candies the outside is horror and the inside is chewy and it's caramel apple flavor and I don't remember where I bought things I'm sure you all remember better than me I do the hulls and I put them up and then I forget which all it was in so I apologize three paces is 60 calories so 20 calories apiece and I'm gonna try to hope but now I don't use my teeth my characters our dad I actually did okay all right this is how they look that's the whole package and now you get to open another package that's okay that one nicely got a show okay this is how it looks you see the hard and I know Kevin Kevin likes to suck on his handy so Kevin will probably be able to show you ah so that's the middle okay so how does it taste oh boy you know I thought yours open I think it tastes like caramel just as I happened you taste a little bit like home or in the divided into and you get that middle going with the caramel do you think some more - all together I'm sucking bun all together and I can taste that caramel I can really you can show up upload I can really taste that call ball outside normally I would second stuck on it problem but for the sake of the review yeah so long that's actually really good it's very sweet it has a great flavor then just a bit all of the voice I'm sure that was attractive yeah that's very sweet I definitely think that would be worth your 20 calories because you're going to be able to keep it around for a long time and some gum doesn't last that long and if you're not against uber anyway I think you would appreciate that can if you like Benz or the gun of course you are getting some calories where a lot of men's or sugar brain calorie-free but but they're very good i would trump if you like Jolly Rancher if you like the horrible Apple I would give them a drop again", "YBkizrOc9x8": "Halloween is fast approaching which means one thing treats I'm here at candy cauldron and Disney spring is with Matt a confectioner who's going to tell us exactly what to do to make an awesome candy apple so these are your Halloween designs can you give us a tour sure this is our poison apple inspired by Snow White in the seven doors and then the next one is going to be a Jack Skellington Apple then we have our mini which popular with everybody and then our Mickey pumpkin and then our last but not least is our Mickey Ghost who has a little bit of extra caramel at the bottom to make his ghostly appearance so what's our first step today we're going to try to make the mini which okay we're going to start with a green apple the reason why we use green apples for these is because they are a little bit of rounder a little bit bigger and also they have a tart taste so we can put all the candy and sugar on top a cup okay it's a nice contrast okay we're going to dip it in our caramel this is already heated for us I'm just going to leave a little bit of green at the top I'm going to carefully scrape a good portion of the caramel out so it doesn't drip it smells so good once it's fully dry we're going to take a nice pair of ears we just use regular marshmallows and we're going to trim off a small bottom so I get a sticky side and if you do that at home you can just use a kitchen knife or scissors yes scissors kitchen knife whatever you have so you trim off like a third or a fourth I would say probably a fourth if you want to go with that okay and then I'm going to place my ears on my applet pretty close Cystic dip the Apple completely trying to get a little bit on the stick as possible but that happens camel sticker so we have to scrape it from top to bottom the chocolate is a little thinner so we just let that drip mostly and then we're just going to wipe the bottom to make sure that has very little drip edge so you see there's a little bit of a skirt there so what we want to do is kind of trim that off this part is a little tricky if you just have a bowl that's good you just dip them in the bowl nice and easy from straight for us since we have a spinning pot we're going to keep them spinning is this for taste or more to glue the decorations on this is a little bit of both because the white with the milk creates a very good taste but it's also to make the sugar pop because we've put sugar on milk chocolate it's not going to look that great on white chocolate it's like a very nice background so now that it's kind of done stop dripping I'm going to take some M&Ms I'm going to carefully place them so you do the M&Ms first not the sugar exactly so I'm just doing a little high-low thing here high low high low that's carefully put our sugar on always do the top first that's the first thing it's kind of dry and then take care of the rest very very last step now this is putting on the Hat on exactly spatula do a little dab and this is something that you've had it you can find a candy mold at a store and make something similar exactly and then right on the marshmallows exactly just like glue don't to hold it down just for a second make sure it stays we go and that's how you make a mini witch candy apple thank you so much for the tips Matt happy Halloween and don't forget to check out the Disney Cars blog for even more Halloween DIY fun", "5BUkIEReYIE": "that we fit you when you four three two one hey guys today I'm going to be doing the I Heart fall tag which was created by missjenfabulous i'm pretty sure and i was tagged by one of my good friends Natalie which is lime peak 2012 you guys probably hear about her all the time so maybe this tag I just did a getting ready on this look if you're wondering so that might be up my not and I got new hair so i'll just quickly tell you all I did was diet like a darker brown it should be lighter but it turned out darker um this is kind of like read it should be golden but it's red because of my previous hairs red and then I put blonde highlights in it so yeah I just wanted something different for fall even though it's highlights which isn't really for fall but it's all I getting used to it I'm either going to put more blonde in it or wait for the brown to lighten up because it doesn't blend as well but yeah that's my new hair and it doesn't look extremely different it looks pretty natural on me so I like it so I'm going to do the I Heart fault tag and I tag you top 10 12 and yeah because natalie are you do this tag duh ok so you guys when I just I can't leave a video response below and i would love to watch it we're just going to start with the questions so the first one is your favorite fall lip product ok so i just got this the other day and literally i've been loving it um this is the um I just said only three times this is the Maybelline Baby Lips and this is the one in chair cherry me which is like a red and it comes off as just a really light pink on your lips it does show up on my lips which I really like so this is my new favorite wallet product that i've been using so i recommend you guys try this in a lip balm and it gives you a little bit of color so this is really good and then the next question is your favorite full of nail polish so the iheart fall times I've been watching the kind of thing is to do three nail polishes so I've through nail polishes to show you so the first one is just a classic black this is the Revlon Colorstay um line and this one is in stiletto this is just a black polish I also love the wet and wild black cream so black and I usually put glitter with black and then I chose to my colors that I wear a lot so this first one is let's groove by China Glaze and it's a really pretty deep royal purple and it's just really pretty it's a blue base so when you put the first coat of this on it'll look blue and that's because it has a blue base so it's a blue base purple and then you put it second coat on and it looks just like this and it's a super pretty deep purple and I love it and then I also have another one from china glaze and this is called Stella this is like a deep metallic pink in my look similar but this is definitely purple this is definitely pink in like real life so it's a deep metallic pink and this is just really pretty I like to wear this with a silver polish on the ring finger so those are my three full nail polishes and then number three is your favorite Starbucks fall drink now honestly I've only been to starbucks one time and that was so long ago and I don't even know what I got cuz I've never been there so I don't know so I don't go to starbucks i just i don't i like coffee and stuff but the closest starbucks that means like 20 minutes away so yeah and then next question is your favorite fall candle and my mom doesn't let me light candles in my room which is ridiculous she thinks I'm gonna spill it or something but she does have a cincy thing and I'll keep touching my hair a lot she does have a cincy thing and it has a really good smelling ones and they're just really good smelling what I don't know what the name of it is but I like a lot of the fall since she has so I don't really have a favorite candle and the next question is your favorite fall scarf or accessory again I don't really wear scarves I don't really wear why we're boots but that's a that's a shoe or boot sometimes I don't do it a lot just because like ugg boots I

something that's my brother and the end the TV but these are simple little easy snacks and I'm just going to be showing you guys how to make them today those are my ones that are cooling and then i'm going to show you fresh batch and how to do it well so let's get into it things you're going to need sorry I'm pouring out my pants things are going to need are a piece of Apple so I'm just going to show you how to make one because it's like you just do the same for making all of them so you're gonna need some Apple pieces and like I said I'm excusing one you're going to need probably a paper plate especially to go except roll you're going to need a skewer a toothpick or some kind of stick we did not happen to have any sticks or anything anything at our house so I am making my own load yeah I kind of thing and I'm just using a simple straw and it actually just goes in there really easy and simple guests are going to need caramel it can be any kind of power you'd like and a cup or bowl or something you can put the caramel in and a microwave oh yeah and you're going to meet us finish so soon you're going to be spit now you can use plastic you can use regular whatever it does not matter so I'm just going to start by opening their caramel let's just open to whatever when I right end of the internet it's all good good morning and we'll get a little sticky obviously now what you want to the wand you take your apple and a stick a shell or your stick right in there and if you guys don't have anything just use a straw lat I am and look how you tend to push a little bit hard and it's secure and when I try to eat one earlier I couldn't even get it off the straw it's really complicated to get off straw you don't know to shove it all the way through so you can't see it on the others so you can see on the outside you just want to shove it about halfway in so that is a durable home now you're going to want to get a reasonably simple amount caramel and I'm going to use a straw different strata wipe it off just stick into the spoon seems blended me to ring the ball mount carmel depending on how much i doing and yeah then you know they're going to head over to your microwave or the microwave now I'm going to grab my cut I'm just going to throw it in here take it in take it for about 20 seconds I'm going to do my pen right now to start them you can look at it and then you can see how mouth and it is and if you have glass cups or glass-like bowls or something you can put the caramel in that's probably preferred so that way you can see the caramel and the way it's looking when it's in the microwave so you don't like overdo it or anything crazy like that so now I'm just blowing my cup ouch either burn 2010 so yeah I think there was party a little bit oh so so I'm just putting in for 10 more seconds because that's as much as I did last time and it just started bubbling and it should be something simple yeah so I thought I heard it bubbling oh yeah it does look like I burned some holes in here it's bubbling pretty well warning don't put a plastic cup in the microwave it will like yeah now since the caramel is hot you just want to be cautious especially if you're a young child blueness you want to be very careful and have prepared supervision for this part then you're going to get as much power as you can on the Apple obviously you're not going to get time that done it I turn it to some pounds of caramel on to your top then you want to just finish off and by putting away a caramel throw your layers cup or your bowl or whatever your hot caramel you're going to want it to let it chill for about 10 to 15 minutes that would be after school put on the plate with some other ones up here on the top so I'm just putting on and then then taking care of my karma a different one but after two this is what your finished product should look like some where near like this it doesn't obviously have to have the same amount of caramel or anything or same size apple and then you didn't and don't wish it makes me feel party for my new job well yeah if you guys like this video be sure to give it a big thumbs up and yeah comment other video ideas for me and be sure to subscribe to my channel yeah you just die more log on they frightened", "wSmWqgk-jVQ": "what's up guys welcome back today we are going to be doing a infused caramel dip um i already made it i actually ate too much of it while i was filming so yeah it's a lot stronger than i expected to be honest i think it's because there's so much butter in here but uh it's very good with apples oh good um i think i cooked it a little bit too long when i get the sugar at first because it's a little bit darker than i would have liked it and a little bit like more of a i don't want to say burnt there's like a little bit of a burnt undertone so just maybe just be really careful that doesn't get too dark when you're doing the sugar at very first i'm very distracted right now and struggling to figure out what to say i really should have filmed the intro before i started eating this but all you guys are going to need for this recipe is white sugar heavy cream infused butter and some salt of course you don't have to use salt if you don't want to but i find it tastes better with that salted caramel salt part of it um i just noticed that you can see my bruise when i'm sitting down and i filmed that intro and i assume people are probably going to ask what that is i had a vein removed so it's pretty much mostly healed now but there's still quite a bit of bruising but this is what it looks like it was like pretty much all here in here but yeah that's just healing so that's all that is i need to show you guys the mess that i have going on here because i film everything in my living room of my apartment that i live in with my sister and it's not a very big apartment um so i pretty much know my filming because we have natural lighting right here um in this area and this is usually our um like coffee table i guess you'd call it but yeah i have this whole thing going on it's like a huge mess i make every time i film something and i got like the curtains all messed up just like throwing everything around but i feel like the end result is pretty good like i'm pretty proud of how it looks but yeah just a little um behind the scenes if you guys are interested in these type of things you guys want to know anything about my life i don't know maybe it's not that interesting let me know in the comments so like i have just said here's what you're going to need one cup of granulated sugar half a cup of infused butter half a cup of heavy cream and one teaspoon of salt so we're going to start by turning our stove top to medium i think i have it a little bit higher than medium here so please don't follow that please leave it at medium and you want a bigger heavier pot um and there we're gonna add in our one cup of sugar then i'm just going to lightly shake the pot to distribute the sugar and then break up the large clumps in there we don't want to be stirring and moving this around because if the sugar touches the sides of the pan from the spatula stirring it around it'll create crystals and it'll make the sugar clump so when it is caramelizing it'll make like a chain reaction of a bunch of crystals so try not to move it around too much so just keep an eye on this and watch as it starts melting and again make sure your heat is not too high because that's where i went wrong and it got a little bit too cooked so it was a little bit darker than i would have preferred it to be so make sure your temperature is on low and just let it melt on its own again without stirring a lot at this point i decided i was being impatient and wanted to stir a little bit more and you guys are going to see exactly why we shouldn't do that so as i'm stirring and scraping the sides there i start to get chunks of sugar on the sides of the bowl um so all of that there is what is going to cause it to get grainy in the end so had i not been touching it so much and didn't have it on a higher heat it wouldn't have been an issue it's already too hard and on so i'm just going to try and ignore it and try not to let the rest of my um caramel uh come to contact with it so you guys can see here how dark it is this is darker than you want to be this is because i had it on a higher temperature if you keep it on a lower temperature this isn't to happen because it'll all it'll be able to melt all the sugar without um over cooking it i guess so yeah so just keep doing this until it is all pretty much completely melted and smooth again keeping it on a medium temperature now that it is all smooth i'm turning the heat off and i'm going to add in the butter so any ingredients we add into this we want to be room temperature the change in temperature going from cold to hot in the pan will cause everything to bubble and get really big and possibly go over your bowl it won't wreck anything at all it's just good to know so you don't use a small pot i just um keep everything room temperature so that i don't have this issue so there we go we put half a cup of butter in there the heat is off but there is still heat in there because the caramel is really hot and the um the stove top is hot and then we're just going to stir this in to melt it um at this point i feel like because mine was already darkened so much i should have just taken it off the heat but that's kind of up to you of how dark you want to be because the butter will be able to melt whether it is on or off of the stove top there so i feel like that i'm getting a little bit of separation in the butter so i'm just going to whisk this really quickly again the heat is still off and then once that is all whisked nicely together we're going to pour in our heavy cream and again like i said my heavy cream i taken out earlier so that it was room temperature if you're going to put heavy cream directly from the fridge it's fine but it will bubble up really high so that's why you need a bigger pot like this then you can just stir it all together it should mix pretty nicely without a whisk and once it's all stirred you can take it off the heat just try and do all these steps as quick as possible because the the longer it's sitting on the heat the more cooked it's going to get in the future i probably would take it off the heat once the sugar is melted and all of this can be done just with the remaining heat from the sugar without actually being on the stove top now you can add the salt i'm adding one teaspoon the butter i used was unsalted if you are using salted butter which i feel like most of you probably aren't but i'm not sure if you're using salted butter taste it without the salt and then if it needs some add about half a teaspoon and then you can just stir that in and that's it your caramel is done you can use it as a dip you can eat it with a spoon whatever it's very liquidy because it's still warm but once it cools it gets a lot thicker and more caramel like um i have never made caramel before this is or this was so much easier than i expected so this was definitely a recipe i am going to make again except i'm not going to cook it for as long but yeah so easy and it turned out really tasty i'm just pouring um it into this little mason jar that i'm gonna keep in the fridge and then i have um some that i'm gonna eat right now with some apples and you guys can see how dark it looks it looks like it looks a lot darker on camera than it does in real life actually ideally it would be quite a bit lighter than this but it still tastes really good and it's super strong so i am very happy with the results of it and here it is the next day i just took this out of the fridge right now and this is kind of how it hardens to now if you let it sit outside of the fridge for a little bit it would be even softer but it's a very very nice consistency i was really craving caramel apples but they're way too much work to make which is why i did this so i'm just going to chop up some apples i have my two favorites granny smith and pink lady also known as pink crisp or lady crisp or something um and i just sharpened my knives and it was a bad idea to go on with the apples like this because i almost stabbed my hand like so many times but yeah so i am just chopping up my apples and what is it for apples here i ended up eating all these apples with a dip plus more dip it was bad i could i couldn't stop but it was so so good it's such like a nice combination the the sour and like sweetness from the apple and the crunch and the coldness and then like the delicious sweet caramel anyways i don't need to sell you guys on caramel apples i'm sure you guys love them just like everybody else and i'm just going to squirt some lemon on my apples uh the lemon helps with them not browning so that they stay looking nice and pretty the easier way to do this is to put put them into a container or bag and then just shake them around with some lemon juice but whatever and look how beautiful that looks i would give this a 8 out of 10 for simplicity and a 10 and a 10 for taste or maybe a 9 for me because i cooked it a little too long and then i'm just packing these up to i don't know move to the couch with me to eat um but yeah with the lemon on them the the apples lasted without browning until um into the evening i wouldn't know any longer than that because i ate them all at that point but when i forgot to mention the caramel sauce can be kept in the fridge for probably about a month if it makes it that long it can probably be frozen too but i'm i'm not positive on that i will have to check and yeah so this was super easy to make this is the first time i've ever made caramel i've never made caramel whatsoever in my life so i probably should have tried making this um without the infused butter before like i should have tried making caramel for the first time before i did this because then i would have learned that if i stopped cooking the sugar a little bit earlier it would have been a less a little bit less burnt but it's still good and honestly it's like not as sweet that way so it stopped me from eating like all of it at once i i need to stop eating yet but yeah i'm really loving this for fall it's very festive like caramel apple and it's all about being festive you know um yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching thank you guys so much for watching have a wonderful day see you guys later", "CC_q8FIfmEw": "Hello folks. Paul here once again for hookah.org and I\nhave another mix for you. This one is Shisha Fruits Green Apple and\nHookah Hookah Butterscotch. Unsurprisingly, this is a caramel apple flavor\nand I actually think its one of the best I've come across. A lot of caramel flavors have an artificial\nwaxy note to them that really just tastes like a candle. This doesn\u2019t. This is very nice. This is clean while still being sweet and\nsomewhat savory. It\u2019s a really great mix and it balances\nthe flavors of both the slightly tart and very sweet green apple with the very soft\nround butterscotch caramel flavors from the Hookah Hookah. Other than the fact that this mix is a little\nbit heat sensitive because both of the components are heat sensitive in themselves, I think\nthis is an absolute winner. Considering the fact that even though it doesn\u2019t\nlook like it, it is autumn, I'm going to keep this one in my rotation for a few months because\nI'm really enjoying this. That\u2019s it. This is Paul for hookah.org saying thank you\nvery much for joining us. Please go down below, like and subscribe. Give us that thumbs up. Make sure to try out this flavor, this combination,\nespecially for the Halloween season and let us know what you think. See you guys next time and happy smoking.", "eyUhcnmiOB8": "today we're going to show you how to make those cute mini caramel apples that we were talking about now if you don't have something like silicon wonderment or a silpat you're going to want to use wax paper but if your wax paper is waxed on both sides you want to take a sheet of newspaper and stick it right underneath it real quick because otherwise you're going to have cute little wax circles on your whether it's our cutting board or your wood table whatever surface that you're using because the heat of these will melt the wax on the other side and make cute little circles underneath your surface and that's no fun to clean up after so very simple we have four things toothpicks a microwave reheatable dish I'm using a Tupperware microwave soup mug fresh cranberries and right now you get these under two dollars a bag super nutritious and then caramels seriously and bindings for like a bucket bag alright so we're going to go ahead and get started okay we're starting with the caramels I took a 10 of them unwrapped them and took about a teaspoon of water in there we're going to zap it in the microwave about Oh 15 20 seconds at a time take it out stir take it out stir 15 seconds take it up stir and it should melt down into nice smooth dipping caramel okay it can take anywhere from a minute to a minute and a half so doing this five or six times in and out stirring to get a nice creamy and in-betweens app and the caramels back and forth this is where you might get your cranberries ready to start dipping by taking toothpicks and then inserting them I'm going to do is left-handed and i'm left handed and then turning them inside the middle of the korean berries this is going to be the stick for your mini caramel apple all right there my caramel is now ready and difficult and it actually took only about 50 seconds in my microwave for those ten camels that water helps keep it from burning because there's so much sugar microwave ovens like salt sugar and fat it keeps that sugar from burning as easily okay so we've got it all nicely smooth you're going to take one of those cranberries that's right on a little stick to pick let me dip it and you set it up on your mat just to sit there and dry that's how fast and simple and easy this is those ten caramels got me a almost 30 of the many little caramel apples so all I have to do that is unwrapped more kind of repeat the process a little bit of water microwave a few times and keep on going until you have as many as you want here's another variation on put like on a small tray a bunch of chopped peanuts then you make them instead of setting them on a mat or your wax paper you set them into the peanuts as they dry they will have the peanuts on the bottom so now you have some caramel apples with nuts and some without I can make them like this for my daughter's class because nobody has any peanut allergies but if you're making them as a gift you want to leave the nuts off now I would package these super cute if it wasn't for the fact they're going to a kindergarten class and it's not fair to the teacher to have to unwrap and do all the fun little things so I'll make this as simple and easy as possible for her to go ahead and serve almost 20 kids now I've got the rectangle cake tickers I talked about before flipped up to the cupcake side some wax paper and then the scissors so you'll see I'm going to do here real quick you can see I've cut the wax paper into squares and I've got a rectangle cake taker here what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the mini caramel apples inside the square that makes it super easy done for the teacher to turn around and serve everybody each kids going to get two of the peanut and two of the plane and then they're going to graph which one they like better so she's tying it into something that they can do that in the next segment to shell and there is our finished product ready to go for the class so you two can make mini caramel apples super easy that's a nice low fat treat kind of fun for the kids thanks for watching you", "fAzmbYRzSis": "oh hello it's five minions [Music] but am I supposed to be skating I think that anyway this is the festival and the season for candied apples I'm a candy addict so eating these delicious treats oh my gosh I think wait I can tell y'all Oh doctor so there's a term for the candy and catch your business for hoarding candy candy apples around they are guaranteed to get y'all that supermodel most of the day a crime from the minions you serve so let's get started making our Canal Street blood red metallic candy apples let's do it so we need 6 viewers for 6 apples and we'll first need to prepare the apples by dewaxing them but this test will be 8 cups of water 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of baking soda 2 cups of granulated sugar is this high sweet we need a cup of ice me if you live in humid areas like we then if you don't you can use a half a cup of corn syrup light corn syrup so high sweet is like a power version of liquid corn syrup it keeps the candy from getting sticky but the amount of the powder corn syrup for the highest week differs from the amount of liquid corn syrup and then we're going to need 3/4 cups of water 1/2 tbsp red coloring and a teaspoon of cotton candy flavoring uh-huh and the metallic red coloring is the airbrush coloring so make sure that you get the right sort of coloring for this and the high sweet let me show you this is the high school and you can actually get the high sweep from Amazon and you can order it from the manufacturer but it comes in a little pouch like this without a pound of it but first we need between the apples by removing the wax to ensure that the candy coating will stick to the apples yep and we think the best apple to use is a crisp containing the Apple we think a tangy a tart apple offsets the sweetness of a candy coating but it's always what you like remember what I mama saying take the recipe and then if you're honest yeah so looking apart about eight cups of boiling water and two tablespoons of white vinegar and one tablespoon of baking soda we're going to submerge the apples one at a time in the bowling vinegar water for about ten seconds we're not cooking the apples just clean so make sure that apples are fully submerge and the water is empty take the apples out after 10 seconds and use your course clean towel to remove the melted wax and drive through ten seconds only you can County 1,001 1,002 now the apples are clean D wax and ready for dipping sift the apples to the side while we make the candy coating now let's get our candy cooking in a sauce pot over medium-high heat you want to add to this pan two cups of granulated pure cane sugar 1/2 cup of the light corn syrup or one cup of the high sweet and 3/4 cup of water stir to incorporate the ingredients but after that try not to stir stir will only prolong the process of reaching the temperature you need the goal is to bring the mixture to a bowl use a candy thermometer to determine the temperature at 260 degrees Fahrenheit and the coloring do not stir in the coloring because the movement of the boiling mixture will incorporate the color into the candy mixture at 300 degrees Fahrenheit a what mama called a hard crack stage removed a candy mixture from the heat then after that you want to add a teaspoon of cotton candy essential oil flavoring and stir it really really well so we need to skewer these apples and what we need to do is take a seven-inch bamboo skewer we bought these from Amazon make sure there's a 7 inch time you want to take your Apple and right where the stem used to be you want to make a twisting motion and twist that skewer and push and you don't want to go all the way through the Apple but you want to make sure that it's on there securely and so that that get that Apple won't fall out then we're going to use some paper straws and to decorate your skewer you just take your space paper straw slide it over the skewer and then push down until you feel that paper straw go into the Apple just a little bit and you can see that it holds really nicely and then we like to clip the the paper straw so that it's even with the skewer and so we just you don't know yeah pinch and then just cut it off there your job and then we pulling the straw now you don't have to do this if you want to you can actually leave your leave your straw tall but this is how you can decorate using paper straws now tilt the pot to pull the sugar insert the Apple slowly and twirl it until the Apple is completely covered that the excess candy fall back into the pot be careful a candy burn is very painful and something y'all don't love so take your time you want to place the apples on the silicone or the well greased wax paper whichever you have so that they can settle and cool here you have it straight from the Bayou Canal Street

Tina and welcome to the antidote the cannabis cooking show that makes medicating delicious today we'll be making a recipe from my cookbook one of the most fun ones in here on page 19 canada's caramel apples i'm super excited to get started on this one I think you really are going to love it the ingredients we'll need for this recipe are four to eight apples I like to use Fuji apples because they're sweet and not so tart but some people like to use like the green granny smith apples but you can use whatever Apple that is your favorite wouldn't treat sticks one-half cup of light corn syrup one cup of brown sugar half a can or seven ounces of sweetened condensed milk 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and any optional treats that you'd like to coat your apples with if anything at all will be medicated today's recipe with 1/2 cup or one stick of cannabis butter if you're new to Canada was cooking and you don't know how to make cannabis butter check out my cannabis cooking 101 online course in the link below alright let's get started the first step in prepping our apples is to bring a pot of water to boil we're going to get that started while they go ahead and pierce our apples so you're gonna take your treat sticks make sure that your out looks pretty level because you don't want it wobbling side-to-side once you actually get the caramel on it so leave it nice and level and then you're going to pierce right down into the stem pressing pretty firmly we'll do it again now that our water is boiling we're going to dip each Apple in the boiling water for five seconds we just want to remove any dirt and any wax from the animal once you remove the Apple from the boiling water make sure to sit on a paper towel and also wipe it off with a paper towel now that our apples are dipped in dry let's get started on our Canada's common sauce we'll begin by combining our butter sugar corn syrup and sweetened condensed milk over medium-high heat we want the butter to melt down a bit before we add the sugar start continuously to make sure that the sugar gets well blended into the butter corn syrup is super sticky so make sure that you get a spatula just to kind of get it all out and into your car now that all the ingredients inside we're going to start continuously for about 25 to 30 minutes or until your candy thermometer which is about 248 degrees tops seems to be getting a little too thick on you it's totally okay to add about one ounce at a time of holding now under candy thermometer has reached 248 degrees while our last ingredients so grab your two teaspoons of vanilla extract import right inside stirring really carefully finally if you're like me and you like salted caramel you can add one teaspoon of salt right into your finished caramel that's what I'm going to do now that my caramel is ready we can start dipping our apples make sure that you have a parchment paper lined baking sheet because you're going to want to put the apples right there when you're done I like to use a swirl motion when I'm [Music] shake off any excess right into the pan if you're going to be using toppings the best way to do it is to hold your topping ball in one hand and dip with the other while the Crom was still hot [Music] and then use some slowly roll your Apple right inside the top we'll do the same thing with the chocolate chips keep rolling and see your Apple is fully covered it's okay to make a mess this is a very messy recipe the apples only need to set a couple of minutes to be ready to eat most of the time when making caramel apples you have some leftover caramel sauce that isn't quite enough to make more apples but we're never going to waste any cannabis caramel sauce so what I like to do is make a little bit of on-the-go snacky so that you can medicate on-the-go or pack it in your work lunch bag or anything like that so what we're going to do is basically make old-school caramel and apples so I like to chop the top right off the top and the bottom of my Apple then I take an Apple slicer you can get this like any dollar store place it right over the top there clear and make some delicious apple slices if you like your Apple a little thinner then these chunks that the spikes makes you can always go back in with the knife to make them just a little bit thinner usually where I do now I'll take our one caramel sauce is poured right into a bowl for dipping you can store any remaining caramel sauce right in a mason jar keep it refrigerated and then pop it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time and you want to use it this sauce is also great for ice cream or pouring on your sundaes if delicious but I'm gonna get some apples in here right now now let's sell them this is definitely gonna be my snack for this afternoon all right guys I really hope you guys enjoyed making cannabis caramel apples with me if you decide to make this recipe please do tag my antidote TV so that I can see what you guys make I would love to see it and let me know in the comments if you like this recipe if you want to see more what kind of recipes you guys would like to see on the show and as always please like share and subscribe I really do appreciate it okay guys I'll see you next week on the antidote [Music]", "PaLoW3HiosE": "hey friends welcome back let's jump into it think you're gonna want to do is use a melon baller they get little okay let's try that again so you're gonna use your melon baller to just cut out your Apple you can use green or red whatever you like the first thing you want to do is take one of your little apple pieces either use a skewer or maybe like a popsicle stick or a lollipop stick and just put it through your little Apple piece then the next thing you're gonna do is you're gonna dry this off just when you try and get off any extra moisture because that way the caramel will stick to it then you're just gonna dip that bad boy in your melted caramel and you can either buy caramel notes and noting yourself or if you're lazy like me you can just buy the caramel apple dip that's right above the apples in the produce section okay once you've given your caramel a second to dry you're just gonna set it on some parchment paper you can also decorate them so just wipe it off again code it in the caramel and then just stick the bottom of it into sprinkles or nuts or whatever you like I've got little sprinkles I've got like big birthday sprinkles pecan pieces you could probably even melt chocolate and dip these in chocolate that's a fun little snack for people who don't like caramel but just use whatever toppings you prefer once you get all of your little Apple pieces done now you're just gonna stick these either in your fridge or your freezer and just leave them in there long enough for the caramel to like set and get hard and that's it you can use any kind of Apple or topping that you like and they just make like a super fun you know Halloween or I guess just fall ah it's just a really good fall treat if you guys try these and you like them please be sure to let me know tag me or comment I live hearing your all's feedback and I hope you try these little things they're so good and as always thank you for watching", "gm7cnJsABZg": "hey Mike watch it this is one of the biggest lollipops in the world did you get that and I've been saving this for a special

home what about listening to spooky stories well these are all memories I have as a kid from the Halloween season one thing I didn't mention though was the amazing food you can have one of my favorite Halloween foods is a caramel apple today I'm going to show you how to make a jolly Richard candy apple so it's not anything like a caramel apple what you're going to need is some Jolly Ranchers I beg it baffles some sticks and a pan put them on to start off you're going to preheat the oven to 350 so while that's going on I'm going to separate the candies now you want to pick one specific color because you don't want them to mention the oven and turn them into a weird brown color to show this how many choose blue now once that is them you put them in the oven so after 15 minutes and you're gonna set them down and you want to do this part quickly because otherwise they will harden so to start off I'm gonna take an apple and I'm going to slice it just like this now next I'm gonna cut the Apple in half if you don't want too big of slices the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to take one my six and I'm gonna put it through the bottom of my Apple next you can use an oven mitt because this is going to be really hot and you're gonna dip it now when you're doing this you don't want to get some candy on here too thick because otherwise they'll be really hard to eat once it's hardened so just like that and then you're gonna set them down in here the candy might slip off sometimes but you just gotta keep dipping it till I can get it to stick just like that and then once you've got a few more done you can set them in the freezer and you can leave them in here for 15 minutes that's just so they cool and dry and then you can take after about 15 20 minutes of them being the freezer you're gonna take them out once they're out you're gonna carefully take them off the tray so they don't break put them on a plate serve and enjoy if this chilly fall air and the falling leaves are reminding you of the Halloween season as a kid go outside jump in a pile of leaves carve a pumpkin and listen to some spooky stories but don't forget to eat some yummy Halloween food you never know you might even find yourself making some Jolly Rancher candy apple pops one chilly afternoon", "mTY8M2MJTPU": "hi guys welcome back to another of my videos today I'm very excited because we're gonna

week okay I make DIYs put the recipes hairstyle makeup a little bit of everything okay so I really hope you like it subscribe and let's get it started we are going to mean of course some apples I'm using granny smith apples but you can use whichever kind of Apple you like some wooden skewers or it can also be lollipop sticks whatever you can find then we're gonna take the stem off our apples all of our apples and after that we're gonna put our apples into warm water okay just a couple of minutes by doing this the wax on our apples will eventually come off and this will help our careful or candy to stick well into the Apple and after that we're gonna watch them and dry them I'm gonna start off by teaching you guys how to do the candy apples okay these are very very easy to make we're gonna start off by mixing 1/2 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 1 cup of light corn syrup and we're gonna add about 1/2 teaspoon of red food color we're gonna stir it and then we're gonna put it into medium high heat for about 20 minutes meanwhile we're gonna put some wax paper into some sort of pan and see how the apples turn out after the warm water after 20 minutes your candy has to be around 250 or 350 degrees Fahrenheit check it with your candy thermometer then we're going to grease the wax paper and after that we are going to start up by coating our apples with the candy okay you have to work very quickly and then we're gonna play them into the wax paper moving on to the caramel apples these are my favorite what you're gonna need is one pound of soft caramel candy you're gonna add two tablespoons of milk and you're gonna put it into your microwave for about a couple of minutes and then I'm gonna smash some peanuts I like this um peanuts because they are kind of sweet and crunchy after removing the caramel from the microwave we're gonna spear and stir and stir it very well and then we're going to cover our apples with this Oh delicious caramel then we add some penis if you don't want to add the peanuts that's okay you can just leave your Apple like that with just caramel now we're gonna do the chocolate apples these are like doing the caramel apples but instead we're gonna melt some chocolate it can be either white or brown or purple which every color you like and then we're going to cover the apples with chocolate oh my God look at this so delicious I'm getting hungry now and I decided to add some coconut to the Apple you can add M&Ms or Oreos or whatever you like this is your Apple okay I just wanted to add some coconut and also some sprinkles into it fits our like heart sprinkles and that is how you make these delicious apples we have a candy the chocolate and of course that caramel okay I really hope you guys liked this video and before I

Wendy from cinnamon sweet up today I'm going to show you how to make some caramel granola apples and then make this you will need piece of wax or parchment paper very well coated with either a vegetable spray or buttered going to be using some granola and now i use my Tyler's trail mix granola that I do have a recipe for on this website I'm also going to be using my non-dairy caramel which i also have a recipe for if you look below you'll see the link for that or you could use just the craft caramels or any caramels melt them and add about two tablespoons of some sort of liquid to thin it out a little bit you can use any Apple as you choose I prefer to use the organic in this case because I don't want them wax and if you could find organic or unwaxed apples that's perfect because the wac if they're wax the camera will not stick if you're not fortunate enough fortunate enough to get them on wax you could just soak them in really hot water for about a minute or so and then wipe the real real cleans try and get as much wax off make sure they're absolutely dry before you dip them and then you're going to need some damn sticks remove the stem of the Apple and screwing or place in your down inside the apple I've warmed up the caramel and it should be pretty thin and I'm going to keep it on a low heat just until I'm done so the caramel doesn't harden over time and I won't have to keep throwing it back in the microwave to reheat it so with the Apple again just dip it through twirl it around I like to thoroughly coat the sides as much as I can and then let the excess drip off be sure to wipe off the bottom where it cools off going to just dump it in the cap the granola I just push the granola on to the side so it sticks it could be a little bit messy if you have a big tray you may be better off just pouring the granola into the tray and you won't have flying all over the kitchen counter like i have but i just wanted to show you a little bit and i like to really coat these well and then place them on your tray and then refrigerate this for about half an hour they look great just the way they are or if you want to make them a little more exciting just drizzle some chocolate on top as well which i always love doing because everything tastes better with chocolate i'm going to wrap these up in plastic and put a little ribbon around them because i do have someone i'm giving them to don't forget if you want to make these yourself check out the link below go to my website cinnamon sweet shop calm subscribe to this YouTube channel and I'll see you next time", "pi08XcUC-ww": "hi guys day we made candy apples showing how we made them so first thing we need to do is Soak took apples and boiling water and second let the Apple sit over light we're gonna sharpen the sticks can you use any pencil sharpener that you can find and sharpen their like this perfect barely put the sticks in the Apple we're gonna wipe off the water at all the Apple make sure you wipe off all the wax on the Apple so the caramel can stick if you're making caramel apples but we're making candy apples we're gonna put in this six inside that Apple and bless the Apple on the patch food paper [Music] we're gonna boil our sugar water have to pull you to stop crap this not a candy thermometer makes things easier they don't know how to make sugar water watch this tall human video now we're ready to make the candy for the apples the red food coloring to the Cadi mixture so lick in with the color of the apple so it's more prettier add in the food coloring into the candy mixture after it boils we have to let the bubbles calm down so we can put the candy apples inside you put it in and twist it around like this we Swilley you have to take out the rest of the candy you have to twist it around in the air so we don't have any extra candy sauce how beautiful this Apple is the other one we did the same thing [Music] gobby afternoon oh my god it's too man MS bit oh my god still dry bag only let your mommy do it cuz it's really really hot now we're going to wash the pot with just boiling water [Music] let's see here Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't don't don't I took it out like don't like a little hole on an apple look at mine look at mine good line so that's it these good also maybe the next video we're gonna make we're gonna make caramel apple thank you I did a fool of video by I've had several more in candy apple that's why you for watching like and subscribe", "RowCYKtTpSg": "College eats what's going on guys and welcome back to another episode of theology saying that today picked up some apples at the grocery store and now since Halloween's coming up my finger may as well make some candied apples right so I want you to put down that red garbage crap that you get the package at the grocery store we're going to make the real deal thing with these guys today we're gonna make some homemade caramel it's super easy to do and I'll show you guys how to do it exactly I'm gonna put caramel on these bad boys and cover them some extra treats you'll find out later in the video what those guys are but anyways guys just sit back relax and enjoy and let's start making some candied apples so I'm starting off with a caramel today we're just gonna have a big deep skillet here if you don't have it you can use a pot or a pan whatever you have but I want to use a deep so when it comes to actually putting caramel on apples I have enough room in the pan I can actually do it so we are going to cover the pan with sugar I know this may look like a lot of sugar it is a lot of sugar but I mean it's Halloween right we only do this once a year so spread it all around the pan we're going to keep that pan on medium low heat and what's going to happen is some of the water from the sugar is going to come out and you're going to start seeing a little pool on the side and it's going to turn into little brown bits and once that happens we're going to stroll around is compute aful you want to watch it because there's a fine line of 30 seconds between when the caramel is perfect and when it burns so don't burn it because if you make this for girl she will not like you and she'll never come over again so don't burn it I tell you don't burn it and watch that grab your beer and bring it to the stove now you can see guys turning some caramelization there so we're going to take it off the heat and going to mix our other sugar around take out the heat and mix it all around this literally only took five minutes so again I took my offer from it I wouldn't take the garbage out and barely caught it before it burned so this is the perfect color were looking for right now golden brown right just what we want let me turn my music off dude okay so got that boy now we're going to take about a half stick of butter yes it is a lot of butter but I said earlier this is Halloween what happens once in a year right so uh and Plus you know the girl must know what you need to put into it right long taste good so got that going around smells free and she and Steve we're gonna put that back down on stove mix all around and this smells tremendous guys I could literally put my face in there and eat it but then I probably won't have a face and I would suck so okay so I now have some heavy whipping cream here you can use regular cream if you're trying to watch your calories but I mean we've already crossed the boundary I Oh thing can idle some man to start mix it around and see we're at try and break up the sugars it's going to be a little clumpy it's okay it'll break up once the heat comes up with a cream and now you want to constantly be stirring here because cream comes up to a ball fast it'll go all over your stove and destroy your kitchen so now you just want to constantly keep stirring until it thickens up like I said early before the cream will start to boil over once your caramels come to your liking and the required thickness just let it chill out on the stove for bit it's going to thicken up tighten up and it's going to get a better stick onto your apples so got this guy going take my apple just put a little bamboo skewer on there use popsicle sticks if you want and early in the video I said we had some treats right so got some peanuts here we're just going to roll this around and some peanuts now guys hot sugar you want to be really careful with this stuff because it really burns probably about ten times more than a hot glue would I had a friend she Burke sugar on her hand and then instincts she wanted her to electrode burnt the crap out of her finger and then she burnt the crap out of her lips will double whammy so be very careful when you're doing this it kills ya for our second treat you got some skittles so I love skittles I love them and I want to taste the rainbow guys got our peanut go to basic apples the caramel and then our skittle up all all epic definitely tasting the rainbow not one brew so you go caramel apples are done for you guys pretty easy to make but I mean not the healthiest for you and sometimes it can be a little messy but hey it's once here right and it will probably guys out there if you make this for a special girl and you give this to her I promise that you will get a lovely smile a hug and possibly a kiss okay but I can't guarantee that kiss a hug it a smile can guarantee but hope you guys enjoy this video hope you guys try this out and I have a sweet Halloween push Oh", "kVTvSFFJPPw": "hey what's going on guys my name is Joey today's video

bit shook enough i don't know if it's thoroughly shooken up no it's not i see why stuff at the bottom but you know what i'll give it a taste test for you guys before i put the camera in so yeah without further ado oh oh it's not that bad just like jolly ranchers are we oh ok so i made the exact amount that uh i uz i usually put like half a scoop of it so it doesn't taste like anything that's

really liked his face Barry but I have her tried this one and she tends to it tastes exactly like a caramel apples that should tell you something from my mama mama retro yeah that's all I want to tell you guys pizza", "aYOp_GuAgFw": "hey you guys thanks for tuning in to my channel so today I'm gonna be showing you how you can make your candy outfits the same day without letting sit up for 48 hours and I'm also gonna be showing you how you can make them without using any corn starch okay so first off we're gonna I have some boiling water here and it's just water nothing in it you're gonna let them boil for eight to ten seconds ten so now what we're gonna do I have a bowl of cold water right here and I'm just gonna take them out of the boiling water and I'm gonna put them straight into that cold water then what this does is get the wax off your apples so you don't have any bubbles in the cold water to cool the mouth so the faster they get cooled the faster you will be able to dip your candy apples and you will see in the water the white film it's the wax that's coming off your apples usually when you do your apples you will do this process but you don't have to put them in a cold water you just boil them for 8 to 10 seconds then you send them out to 48 hours well today we're gonna be doing on the same day within two hours so what I'm gonna do is let these apples sit in this cold water for about two hours I'm let them cool and then I'll be back with child and we're gonna get our candy apple mixture going and I'm gonna be showing you how to dip them without using any corn syrup all right I'll be back and don't forget to subscribe hey you guys I'm back my up was getting quite taped two hours to cool because my water was so cold it only took about 45 minutes if you're not sure that your apples have cooled all the way just let them stay the extra 30 minutes two hours of the other time the only reason I do this process if I have an emergency order that is due that day and it just has to be done that day and I didn't have time for me to sit out for 48 hours that's not the only way that I do this process other than that I would like them to set out for 48 hours okay so I'm taking everything that I have and I will be using for the candy apples I have the silicone mat I have my apples I already put the straws and sticks in them and I have to that's not sitting up really perfectly and if you come across the apples that you know I created it's the Apple then you just turn it upside down and stick to stick staying in the straws and from the bottle I have my red food coloring miss winters I have a measuring spoons I have my King apple thermometer I have sugar a measuring cup and also have white vinegar all right let's get started okay another thing I meant to mention before I get started on the kingdom Minister is when I first started doing candy apples I cannot figure out why my candy apples will break down around the top once I would dawn and you know they would be good they were they would look pretty but they will break down very quickly around the top of the rim and I look on YouTube and I looked everywhere and I was trying to figure out why was they breaking down so quick around the edge of the rim and I learned it was because I was pressing them as meaning I was putting a stick in a straw in and then I was dipping them right out there and not getting drawn down in there really good because once you pierce your Apple that juice down in there it settles when you after you dip them and then it starts to break down your Apple at the top very very quickly so when you do your apples after you stick to straw and stick in them you want to make sure that you get down and they're really really good and that they're dry down in there one thing that I do to make sure that they're dry and when I do I clean my apples and then I will let them sit out a day and then I would pierce them I will go ahead and put my sticks and my straw and then I will let them sit out that following day before I get ready to dip them so you know it's best to let them sit out for 48 hours so then have time you know for them to dry around the top and you don't have to wear them by breaking down really quick okay so the first thing you're gonna do you're gonna put your two cups of sugar in your pot that's two and the batch that I'm making this is a small batch it makes you can do about say about six small apples and about four large apples so if you have more than now you have big apples that's double the batch all right so it has a two cups of sugar 1/2 cup of water and we're gonna do 2 tablespoons of white vinegar well I'm gonna do one tablespoon because this is a half a batch I'm so used to doing the whole package there okay so in his pie I have the two cups of sugar a half a cup of water and a tablespoon of white vinegar and you're just gonna stand it up real good and as I was telling y'all in the beginning of the video we're not using any corn syrup so I tried to find when I started doing candy apples I tried to find a recipe that didn't have any corn syrup and it was hard to find so I finally found the recipe they didn't have any corn syrup and they turned out perfectly the same as if I would have used corn syrup alright so once you get that all stirred up real good I'm gonna turn my stove on to medium which I have it on number six in between five and seven and what you're gonna do you want to make sure that you don't have any sugar around the edges of your pot well I'm yeah around the edges because the sugar around there would keep it from crystallizing alright so what I like to do my sink take some water and just wipe down around them when make sure there's no I usually do it at the sink but you can see and that's it and we're gonna let that cook down till we get to 300 degrees I'm gonna get to 300 degrees I will return and we're gonna start dipping all right put my candy apple thermometer there and you want to make sure that it doesn't touch the very bottom on the pot cuz you would get that accurate reading so once that hits 300 degrees I'll be back okay you guys I'm back and I just started putting my food coloring in there you know I like to put my food coloring in at the end you can also put your color in before you start your candy mixture it's up to you once you figure out you know if you really put it in at the end but when you put it in at the end you do have to work very quickly because your mixture will thicken up and if you put too much food coloring your mixture will thicken up so I think I want a little bit more weight to get it a little redder in this it's very high so you do have to be careful I'm running on white so I really had to stretch it I think that's gonna be it I think that's good colors good stirred it up real good not that the bubbles has died down soon gonna okay so I like to turn my pot to the side and I don't mean to and I try to cover my whole Apple right and I'm just gonna sit it on my silicon mat and go to the Nexen trying to get it or you can see I'm sorry don't go go do something and then I'm just gonna dip the next one that's why I like to do a double batch because I like to have make sure my top get covered and I'm gonna make sure you have the more you have to work with and it's easier to cover your top I like my whole Apple cover just okay those otherwise that I've already dipped and this is the last room and as you can see there's no bones and look at that shine happy cameo stop having to sit them out for 48 hours or use any corn syrup all right I'm sure they look no perfect pretty candy apples without using any cross out and not people to pick them out for 48 hours and the shine isn't that pretty all

what are we gonna make you easy apples we're gonna make something out at apples Leah what else we gonna put it with these apples yeah yeah okay so to give a quick recap have a couple of sweet apples I've unsalted peanuts which you've gone ahead and mashed up so we can use those kind of sprinkle any kind of caramel soft caramel we're gonna melt it these are popsicle sticks chocolate of some kind it doesn't have to be this brand it just has to be something that will melt evenly we have a sprinkle set so there's a couple different varieties of sprinkles in here again this is going to go on top of the chocolate and then we're gonna have a cutting board which we will cut up some slices for our apples so let's get started these sticks are fairly thick so it's important that we get a decent chunk of Apple so that it stays in otherwise it's gonna break out wondering why I'm cutting them so thick that's why so I'm doing the decent sized slice again you can see that it's bigger than the stick and that's why okay we'll get probably two slices out of each half and then that leftover slice which we won't use we can use that as a snack same thing on this side all right we're at our stove I've got it on about a three so medium low and I've opened up the chocolate we're just gonna break them up to the pot like so you can do this over a double boiler it's really not comfortable and you don't want the chocolate firm but let's just say that I have a little experience with chopper we're gonna melt this down so that the chocolate is running enough that we can pour it on top of the apples and I'm actually gonna get a second all right so alia is over there stirring the chocolate I'm going to go ahead and show you how to push the stick into the Apple it's pretty easy actually you just got to be careful not to slide it through the top at once a blob once you go through just lay down our parchment paper which is on the cookie sheet I'm just gonna pour it on top a little bit each one and then we will let the kids especially smooth about this mess it fairly quickly now one thing to note it's okay you'll notice that I'm letting the chocolate drip down onto the sticks that's going to be our glue to help hold those sticks in because again we want these to stay on the sticks so that when our kids chowing down on these they don't come off the stick and make a terrible mess the next step is to take our camels we're going to melt these down heat them up low heat as you keep on stirring up the file they won't burn so I'm gonna get some more caramels and then we'll be back when they're melted probably a couple minutes smell them now our caramel as you can see this was two bags of those words because what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over take this to our apples on all we're gonna do is drizzle across the ribosome hook cross okay so I think that's good enough doesn't have to be perfect this is for our kids so and that's what you do so we're gonna do that for the rest of these and then we'll come back after this set a little bit and we'll put our toppings on you got some sprinkle and then just some playing weight and so that so yeah I'll let you do this one here first what would you like to sprinkle on top okay then just connect yeah get down there okay BJ what would you like to put on that one okay sprinkle it under your Apple good oh it's okay terney Anna do you my name that's or anything else on there that's nuts there you go okay put it right onto your temple slice yeah so this is pretty much it we're gonna go ahead and finish sprinkling on toppings on all of these and then I'll go put them in the fridge for probably 15 20 minutes tops you can see the chocolate is actually setting up already so it's really just about getting these toppings settled on and solidified yeah you can eat this Michael I enjoy chocolate caramel topped apple popsicles I guess we'll call these you can see they've been sitting in the refrigerator for a little water then probably need we wanted to make them more of a dessert for the kids but Apple mrs. Liam exactly what we gonna take taste this way take a bit of that weight out later hard chocolate okay what do you think thumbs up so there you have it Apple a lot of the cops where apples with chocolate and caramel and whatever toppings you want we favored is the usual subscribe to my channel like the video share it to the world and give me your comments appreciate you watching Thanks", "8epAH8VJaEU": "with Halloween right around the corner I have been dreaming about making caramel apples they're sticky and sweet and a treat that everyone loves and I'm gonna show you how to make them ridiculously adorable you can find these cute little crab apples at your local farmers market a lot of times or even grocery stores this is the perfect bite now what pairs perfectly with Apple's caramel of course you can make caramel from scratch or you can even buy it in these cute little tubs already made you just pop it into the microwave for about 30 seconds at a time until it's ready to be dipped so make sure your apples are clean and rinsed and dry and using a chopstick or a little lollipop stick or even a skewer just push it into your Apple and then dip your Apple I find that it's really easy to just kind of roll it once swirl off the excess kind of drizzle it off and then I like to hold the Apple upside down and kind of let that excess caramel just drip down before I put it on the wax paper now if you want to put sprinkles on your caramel apples you have to do it when the caramel is still hot over here I have sprinkles candies crushed cookies these cute little spooky eyeballs that I found at the craft store just dip it in there push it down and then I think I'm just going to do some of these little Halloween sprinkles on top these are just the perfect size I mean who can eat an entire caramel apple by themselves I usually just cut it in half and share it with someone have you ever seen those gorgeous gourmet apples that are covered in different colored chocolates and candies well it's really easy you can buy the chocolate candy melts and melt them and they have every single color you could imagine and then I'm actually gonna let this one set because I want to drizzle other chocolates on top so I have one over here that I've already done in 1950 a Kraft Foods employee thought of a brilliant idea to print the caramel apple recipe on the back of the bag of caramels before you know it caramel apples were popping up all over the country and they're still popular today did you know that there are over 7500 varieties of apples ranging from everything as Tiny as a little pea to apples as big as grapefruits now when you're choosing caramel apples you want to go with a nice tart hard apple so you really have that balance between sweet and sour the best caramel apple I've ever had was dipped in caramel then white chocolate then graham cracker crust and then rolled in cinnamon sugar it tastes like cheesecake on a stick it was so delicious I think I stretched it out to four days just like taking little bites here and there another interesting fact is one of George Washington's favorite hobbies was pruning his apple tree it relaxed him these crab apples look so cute with the lollipop sticks but they look even better when you add a real stick to them you can get these at your local craft store they're non-toxic you just push it into the middle of the Apple and the presentation is adorable I mean what's not to love about these caramel apples they're loaded with candy and chocolate and caramel and they're so delicious thanks so much

jet the 420 chef and welcome to another episode of the 420 gourmet today we're going to make some delicious caramel corn my favorite snack in the world is caramel corn and there's nothing better than canna caramel corn we teach you how to make it it's really simple and we're gonna even teach you how to make it a little more special than just a cannabis but first we have to start with the popcorn so it's pretty simple you want to make sure that you have popcorn on hand and oil alright put the popcorn on first on the water okay there way to put some oil in there you're just going to make sure that there's just enough oil to cover the popcorn but you're gonna want to make sure that you've got a pretty high flame on this because popcorn has to get pretty hot too pop make sure you have a top but before we put the top on we're gonna do something a little more special we're gonna take some butter and we're gonna put some butter in there and mix it around so that you've got a buttery flavor in there okay so as you can see the popcorn is starting to bubble and sit a little bit Givi about another two minutes before it starts to pop you wanna do this before it pops otherwise it's gonna pop in your space so tricks take some butter just stick it right in there so now you gonna want to make sure that you stir it around you just stir that butter around to this butter all throughout you want to put the butter in too soon because then it's gonna burn alright so just make sure you've got that buttery flavor as soon as the butter is done melting you're gonna cover the pot and then you'll start to hear a pop within about two minutes so you want to make sure you that all the butter is melted into the oil and then as soon as it is you're gonna take your top we can put it on so it can pop and not pop all over your kitchen see that it only took literally like 2 minutes pretty stuff popping you can hear I love that sound but I really love this smell alright when you start to hear that it pops is starting to kind of slow down just shut your flame look what I just did now it's basically just popping we don't want to burn the bottom so you want to make sure that you shut the flame while it's finishing popping you'll have almost no loose curls at the bottom of all the great pops and voila right now you just want to take your little spatula here and just I cross it around a little bit make sure there's nothing that's stuck on the bottom because again if you do it's gonna burn how awesome is that if you want your caramel corn to taste great then salt your popcorn first use a sea salt sea salt are incredible Celtic sea salt one of my favorites it's also really great on popcorn just sprinkle that in there all right toss it around again you can hear they're still popping there's loose kernels are still popping in there we're gonna let this sit just for a little while so it kind of dries out let's see how this is you can hear it still popping a little bit Wow just incredible so before you start take your popcorn and just scoop it on onto a pan just like this just say you know how much popcorn you're gonna be able to have yeah it goes so now that we have just as much popcorn is we're gonna need for this pan we're gonna take it and bring it over to our bowl here just very carefully dump it into the bowl try not to make a mess cuz pop words of pain to get out of this goes and now let's make our Kanak caramel sauce alright so we have here one stick of butter les two tablespoons okay because then we're also gonna have two tablespoons of cannabutter so ultimately you want the equivalent of one stick of butter we've got a cup of brown sugar I'm adding a little extra brown sugar that is a very special brown sugar to me it's a chili smoke Brown children we have maple syrup mixed with dark corn syrup you can use light corn syrup or dark corn syrup I like the dark corn syrup because it adds more color adds a little more body it's really delicious and of course our little secret ingredient there really make caramel and caramel corn believe it or not is baking soda alright so let's get going here let's turn up the pot a little bit alright put the butter in so now you're gonna want to do two tablespoons of can of butter so you want to do is go into your sink into your can of butter take it out great way to level this off is to just take a knife to go straight across the top and there you go that's one and that's due to another tablespoon alright we'll let that melt now we're going to want to do is you're going to want to add the brown sugar next we'll add the sugar to the butter our little secret mix in the brown sugar right here and then we're gonna put our corn syrup in here corn syrup mixed with maple syrup make sure that you have a silicon spatula on hand to do this with you can use a wooden spoon as well you may not have sacrificing that wooden spoon because what happens is the caramel actually sticks to the spoon it's a real pain to get off of to soak it for a long time in order to clean it these silicon spatulas are really great because the camera basically just comes off it so we're gonna bring this to a boil and when it boils it to be a rolling boil and as soon as we get that rolling boil we're gonna boil it for five minutes and that's basically gonna heat up to just about the candy stage you can really freestyle some of this as well like you notice that I put in that chili whiskey brown sugar but you know I think I'm gonna put something else in here as well let's add a little vanilla bean paste you can use vanilla extract I have a friend of mine music peppermint extract for the holidays it makes a really amazing peppermint caramel corn so you can do a few things here to just make it your own alright now once it's been boiling for five minutes you don't want to touch it you want to let it boil at the 5 minute mark turn it off take your baking soda we're gonna use half of a teaspoon of baking soda so just take that put it in your box take your pot and hold it over the popcorn and you're gonna see why this is going to foam up okay so here we go sprinkle in the baking soda and here it goes to foam and then just pour it over as its foaming all right now just toss it around to coat it evenly now we know that each one of my tablespoons of cannabutter that I'm using now is 20 milligrams of THC so those 20 milligrams times 2 means that you've got 40 milligrams of THC in your caramel corn here so you're going to want to remember that you've got 40 milligrams of THC in this caramel corn so if you have 4 friends over each one of you is going to have 10 milligrams of delicious canna caramel corn this already smells so great now before we get started to put this on the pan let's do one thing make sure that you either line your pan with parchment paper you can spray that parchment paper with the cooking spray I'm just going to go straight to the pan a little bit crispy nests if you don't use the parchment paper so we're gonna to spray that pants or doesn't stick because if you basically candied corn yeah the Candy's gonna stick to the pan so now you just take this out pour it onto your pan here now spread it out so that it's pretty good even you don't want to make sure that you've preheated your oven to 200 degrees and then you're gonna put this in the oven for one hour but you're gonna have to check it every 15 to 20 minutes and toss it around because what you're doing is you're unsticking it you're basically drying it out you're caramelizing it it's getting really nice and crisp and after an hour we're gonna have a really good time here all right let's put this in the other now we're gonna check this every 15 to 20 minutes for an hour it's been about 20 minutes now let's go in and let's toss and turn the caramel corn that's how beautiful that is right there so just want to do this just toss it around a little bit so that it doesn't all lump together and it gets better coat it's nice and moist still so you're gonna do this like 2 or 3 more times in the next hour and after an hour you're gonna take it out you let it sit and it's gonna get nice and crispy all you got to do smells so good just lit up oh let's set it down here very careful it's very hot ok we can let that sit for about half an hour they're gonna break it apart we're gonna put in two bowls and we're gonna serve it where I guess I'm gonna have a good time okay so now you have it now you know how to make my canna caramel corn until the next episode this is Jeff the 420 chef saying peace out and service constantly [Music]", "2mwcypX7OSs": "hi you may have noticed that the weather is starting to get a little bit cooler the leaves are starting to turn colors on the trees and everywhere you turn there's pumpkin spice anything and everything fall is my personal favorite time of year and one of the things I love about it is the Delicious apples one of my family favorites is making caramel animals and I don't know if it's happened to you but there's sometimes I'll want to eat a caramel apple and this large mean is just way too big or maybe you have kids that you don't want them eating that much sugar in one sitting so today I'm going to show you the perfect solution for that meant to mini caramel apples you may have seen this on Pinterest if you're a browser and you'll may have even noticed that sometimes it doesn't always work plan I've given you some tips and tricks to ensure that it does work for you so to start off we're going to go over the supplies that you'll need I am going to use the crock pot method for moving my caramel so I have a crock pot I have two medium glass bowls I actually have mine already going so about this size you'll need water you will need some parchment paper and a cookie sheet some paper towels a melon baller and of course need your caramel and your apples so you want to talk about your apples sorry your Cardinals first there's a few different things that you can use there's the individual pack the ones where they have the each one is wrapped up now I only recommend really using those if you don't plan on using the whole thing and that way you can just save them or if you have kids helping you and that way you can give them a job to do that's not involving any heat and it's a great great way to have them contribute otherwise I'd like to use these caramel bites or bits because they're smaller and already unwrapped and then as far as apples go I choose to use granny smith apples because they are really tart in very very crispy so they hold up against that sweetness of the caramel very well of course you can use any type of Apple that you prefer so once you have all your supplies together the very first thing I recommend is to get your caramel going in the crock pot if you're using this method it is very very slow so you want to start at least an hour before you do anything else to do it in the crock pot you're going to want to put some warm water in the crock pot have it on low but you'll only run up the lit up a quarter of the way maybe halfway depending on how much how they your bowl is so really you only want it coming up to here on your bowl because you want to be careful that none of the water gets inside if water gets inside with the caramel it's actually going to break her tournament and it's going to be usable anymore the reason I like to use the crock pot method instead of other methods is because I have a tendency to cook it if I use the stove or the microwave and it works out because you can always taste caramel so once you have this going about to the temperature that you want you're going to want to go ahead and peel your Apple so you get your Apple nice and peeled you're gonna want to make sure you have a paper towel ready to then you'll want to take your melon baller and just make little balls well as with anything in the kitchen things can and do go wrong not a big deal just pop out another one if you have a dog you have an apple for your dog okay so we're going to get a couple of these out and this next part is a very important step you're going to want to dry these off as much as possible this is one of the first tips that I have for making the mini caramel apples anyone who has tried these before knows it doesn't really stick become it just falls right off the reason for that is because when you're doing the whole apple the skin lets the caramel stick to it because it's holding back moisture the ankles themselves are very juicy shows why we like them most of the time but it repels so you get them nice and dry and then what you'll do is you'll take treat sticks you can get these in a local craft store and of course during the fall they're available at other stores because Halloween colors they come usually about two inches you can cut them in half to make them a little bit shorter and then you get the double mouth so what you want to do is take your stick and stick it right in to the Apple you want to go really deep in there but not all the way through okay and when you do so more of that water or those juices are gonna come out and you'll want to make sure you dry it off again okay so I'm gonna do that to this one as well get it nice and snug in there and dry it off now right before you're ready to dip your apples you're going to want to get a glass of ice water so I have or the other Bowl that you have fill it with some ice and some water and this is going to be the second part of the trick to getting the caramel istic so what we're going to do is we're going to first dip the Apple caramel and we're going to want to make sure that we get it completely covered even where the stick meets the Apple we want to 100% cover fortunately you can't see inside of here but I what I'm doing is I'm using the spoon to help ensure that the crema sticks to every little part and once completely covered we'll take it out of here it's going to want to drip a lot okay you can take it out and put it right directly into this I swap what that ice water does it helps set the Karma so we're going to then dry it off and then at this point if you want to using dip it into any nuts or in the chocolate this is when you could do so otherwise you'll want to put it on a cookie sheet with parchment paper as you go so we'll have all of our Apple mini caramel apples lined up here let's see if we can get one more done it can be a lengthy process because it is a little bit slow and the key when you're doing the kernel is actually just make sure that every bit is covering that stick or the stick and stick it in here again you don't have to hold it in there too long just a few seconds will do and it sets the caramel right on the Apple and there you have it after you get all of your apples done you want to go ahead and stick it in the refrigerator or the freezer to help it set just a little bit more but at that point it should stick to your Apple just like a regular caramel apple and then you're free to enjoy or and give to the kids", "grWIA9vQ0P8": "caramel apple jello shot the sexiest little creatures

apples the easiest way to make caramel apples is by purchasing one of these kits you can get them at any local grocery store don't forget to remove the stem from the Apple then you're going to want to take the caramel and place it on the top going down go ahead and tug and pull so it completely covers the Apple next you're going to want to get some popsicle sticks and carefully push them into the Apple preheat oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and then put these apples in for about five minutes next is the fun part decorating we're starting off by putting some mms on the bottom of these caramel

thick slices next melt some white chocolate and add die to make it orange also melt some milk chocolate you spread the chocolate evenly then have fun decorating with eyes and sprinkles and there you have your Apple pops let's try these delicious damage", "rImEvGZJvF0": "it will surprise your guests with this recipe because I learned it recently and I want to try it at least one time for this fall season and now I want to show you what I do with the leftovers of the cookie that I made in my previous video for this recipe you will need some cake pop sticks for candy sticks as they call them sometimes I got this one from target and it was dollar ninety-nine some condensed milk or you may need even Nutella depends which one you like either milk or Nutella i'm going to use both and then you will need hand blender and the mixing bowl let's start first we are going to cut the large pieces into small and then put into the blender then we'll add 2 tablespoon full of condensed milk or you may add note LF depends on your taste I'm going to mix only half one half goes with Nutella the other half will go with condensed milk so I'm separating into two parts and adding one into the mixing bowl so for this one I'm going to add 1 tablespoon full of condensed milk because I have very little to mix i'm going to use just one tablespoon full of condensed milk putting just one now lets blend ok i guess it's enough in order to decorate your candies you may need some type of sprinkle i'm going to use two different types of sprinkles one is the chocolate one flavored sprinkles and this one I got from last year from target it's called harvest the course I may use this one if you can't find those you can just get some jumbo candid buttons they sell it at big lots I got this one from clearance it was dollar fifty and it has different flavors orange cherry lemon raspberry etc and so I separated aight sticks for my candies I'm gonna make four candies with chocolate flavor which is Nutella and for with the condensed milk so we're going to separate whatever we got here here is the consistency of our better we have two large balls which I'm going to separate into two more this one is going to become cute the same happens to this one the consistency should be a thick so you can work with it okay now we have four candies almost ready I'm going to get some colorful falls into my glass plate now that our round balls are ready we're making it as a poll by rolling it and then while putting the stick from one side don't push it till the end otherwise it will come out from the other side and here we just press our candy and i'll show you what i dt end result well I decided to decorate my to combat milk mix candies with the candy buttons I already pulled out some red ones and some oranges you just pull it and it's coming out and here we go as the pros had hard time of sticking to the round ball I have decided to add more condensed milk by just spreading it on the surface of the ball so the decorations would stick to it and won't come out the milk is working as a google in this case the more you put the better it works so let's do the orange ones not going to add the red ones on bottom because there's going to be too much and the candy may not handle it well I will just leave the top part and the bottom part with no candy buttons and here we go now we're putting the stick on the bottom just pressing a little bit and letting our candy to dry and you may use some small short glasses and here are the final looks of my candies from condensed milk and pumpkin bread leftovers now i'm adding 1 table taken full of nutella into my leftovers i will blend them together it's blending kinda with difficulty but still blending see well dear friends i ended up making different type of candies with different shapes because I thought we shouldn't do only the ground balls but I decided to do mush shape some type of circle e medallion shape and this one is just a rectangular square and i did a triangle shape i'm going to decorate them now with this one package of the bones that are leftovers from last year's Halloween candies these were sold in a large package where they had about 20 small packs of different colors bones and that's what I used for decorating my mushroom shaped candy and this one is almost broken one side is the red one in the middle the other side is the yellow one in the middle we just press inside and while our candy is already the Nutella mix didn't work well so I ended up adding 1 tablespoon full of condensed milk on top of the Nutella that I was using but it's still breaking up see it's cracking because it's not moist enough to keep the shape so try to add some condensed milk on top of the Nutella that you have well I guess this one is going to turn around now well dear viewers this is the final result of my today's candy making this was my first time to accept that's why I had some cracks on my candies it means that they're going to be

here I'm a little sick today and as you guys know we film all these episodes in one go you sound like garbage I know it's terrible so enjoy this for the next four episodes or however many we're doing today today however we're gonna do the candy of the candy so not candy apples caramel apples chocolate apples yeah do a couple different kinds yeah these turned out surprisingly good actually they were like they were so good and they turned out really nice on camera they look good these were they were awesome I'm really struggling here getting like it's like in there we went to the store we couldn't find any shorter ones we found like really short ones that we're too short they were too short but had the spike in a mess yeah anyways you saw us put them in water to get rid of all the wax we just put that in warm water for five minutes get some of the wax off for the sticks and get them ready here we're gonna start the caramel so we put brown sugar light corn syrup I believe it was unsalted butter and this is sweetened condensed milk and we're gonna put this in a pot we're gonna heat that too I believe it was 250 yeah how is it different from the other camel that we make all the other caramel is a lot roomier this is this is heating the sugar to something called a soft boil stage so depending on what temperature you eat sugar up to it will cool down either hard or soft depending what temperature reaches and we're going for 245 here which is gonna make it sort of soft and chewy when it cools down kind of like a chewy where that is original yeah exactly yeah man nobody under 50 I got a bunch of those once it's been heated we're gonna put it in a bowl of cool water here or you can just see us kind of putting it in that's gonna bring down the aw man I didn't really need a drink Jesus bro okay not a good day cold water do we leave it in the coat you don't leave it in too long I just got a little too big slot you can see it's hard to work with man I've done enough episodes you think I know how to film this Ricky there we go I turn it around there what am i doing I'm just all over the place sit the word shot what a disaster just everything about this has gone down oh my gosh dip it in the Cullens all the descriptions are you know yeah yeah although the salted caramel ocean right no the caramel and the pretzels was our favorite combination on I thought this was gonna be my Lucy has turned out to be my favorite by far when making it it was my least favorite but when eating it it was my delicious most delicious chocolate coating here you can see us chopping up the charm really taking my time again with my yeah yeah I mean I guess we had a feel for mix somehow it's not that they don't get of a recipe we used a darker chocolate on for this one which is it's a little bit more bitter which is fine but we quoted it we also coated it with like the score bits which you'll see shortly but if you're not gonna coat it with anything you may want to use just like a milk chocolate just cuz the bitterness was yeah it ain't if you're not gonna have any toppings just use the milk chocolate it's the added sweetness but if you're gonna add sugar don't have a really sugary chocolate it turns out that the dark chocolate like the bitterness and the sweetness and the Apple and all it came together it comes together nicely when you're eating it works out a lot better the pistachios look good too he has green contrast those were also really this has been a useless video I don't think we've told them a single step how could two happen what a disaster today this videos the equivalent of the eye that Taylor so everything I show everyone's just talking about how talking about hanging out oh my god this is so good what a waste of everyone's time yeah they look good though we haven't won a Silpat if you're gonna put them on something to rest put them on parchment paper so they don't stick yeah it was good they were good like them a lot thanks for watching guys I'm angry I'm gonna be sick next video but we'll see you next week we subscribe not after this", "IHBKIPIVc6w": "hello everybody welcome back happy Tuesday so today we aren't getting in to fall which I'm so excited about I've so many recipe ideas planned you guys oh my gosh so we are starting off with some caramel apple cake pops so I think these are super cute because caramel apples are already like this shape and have a little stick coming out of them so it's like we just kind of turn them into cakes so the spiced apple cake base I actually have some caramel mixed in and they're also dipped in a butterscotch chips so these definitely tastes like caramel apples and they are so good so let's get started so first when I combine kin flour baking powder salt cinnamon allspice and nutmeg and cloves in a large bowl then you want to add the butter and pulse until fully combined then add some brown sugar and the egg and mix well gradually add some milk until you have a smooth thick batter then pour the batter into a greased loaf pan with the surface and they get free punch in 50 degrees Fahrenheit for about 40 minutes or until the skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean slice off the crust of the cake and crumble it into a fine crumb then combine some vanilla frosting and dulce de leche in a bowl and then add this to the crumbs and mix until fully combined so the cake should be able to be kind of like squeezed and shaped into balls that's the consistency that you're looking for so you can add more or less frosting as you need roll the cake into little balls and place them on a tray lined with plastic wrap pop them in the freezer until they're firm for about 20 minutes then place them red and green candy melts into my grave safe bowls and if you'd like you can add some white and yellow candy melts to the green candy melts to kind of create a more vibrant green color microwave for 30 second intervals until they're fully melted then add a teaspoon of vegetable shortening to each bowl and mix until it's fully melted and this is just gonna make the consistency a lot thinner and it's going to give you a thinner coating on the cake pops and it just won't be so thick and chunky and hard to work with then you want to reshape the cakes into apple-like shapes then stick a lollipop stick into some red or green candy melts and then gently insert that into the top of the cake pop we're talking the cake box to the freezer until they're firm for about 10 minutes doc the cake pops into some red or green candy melts fully covering them and then return them back to the baking sheet and pop them in the freezer until the candy melts have hardened for about 15 minutes then you want to place some butterscotch chips into a microwave-safe Bowl in my grave for 10 second intervals until they're melted so they seem to kind of seize up very quickly in the microwave so um so I found that if you just microwave them for 10 seconds and then stir they'll melt so much better then add another 1 teaspoon of vegetable shortening and mix until it's fully combined dunk each cake pop about halfway into the butterscotch chips then return them back to the freezer until they're fully set and you are done so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe if you have any other fall requests definitely

"zxGcS8etrxI": "all right today let's take a look at one of the most controversial snack foods out there today marshmallow peeps I remember back doing a simpler time when marshmallow peeps were just something you had endure during Easter but now it's Christmas and New Year's and Martin Luther King Day and summer winter fall not just spring and Easter anymore and they have all these different types of crazy flavors trying to keep themselves relevant there's a fall flavor our three chicks deeps delights caramel apple flavored marshmallow dipped and decadent salted caramel flavored fudge let's go take a take a peep what's up with these peeps the defeat there no one's ever said that before look at that face do I look like someone who gives a damn with God Thanks no no you don't little peep it smells like Apple so let's say it's a couple of ways I can do this I'd like to try just the salted caramel part first without any and I'd be damn near impossible so let's take a chunk here and see what's going on hmm going back from war hmm salty caramel pod tastes great not overly sweet not overly salty nice balance it overpowers the the Apple marshmallow flavor not getting much of a of an apple flavor in here hmm it's it's a very very light apple flavor almost non-existent when you eat it without the salted caramel Parton and once you if you bite into this with alongside the salted caramel you don't taste it at all salted-caramel takes over everything these are my opinion the best marshmallow peeps ever created now I don't hate marshmallow peeps like some people do I'm not completely disgusted by them I just don't prefer them and I never buy them on my own but these I would buy these again these are delicious that's salted caramel is great there's like no apple flavor in there at all you know it's like really really really subtle if any if my mind is not playing a trick on me and I just think I'm tasting Apple because it says it's supposed to taste Apple on the package supposed to taste like Apple in the packaging that could be a possibility that oh I'm tasting a nice that is a nice salted caramel fudge goes definitely they said it was decadent they said it was a delight it's right there peeps delights and this was a delight it definitely gives us give this a thumbs up", "mDTk6xEpcpo": "hi Margy and welcome back to my kitchen\nwhat I have here are this is a candy bar on a stick it made it I did it on a\nstick because I thought it would be very easy to dip in chocolate this way so\nthese are it's like a heath bar a toffee bar score bar on a stick with chocolate\nwith really really good chocolate on it so inside know if you'll be able to see\nhere but there's toffee inside now this is the first candy I'm really making\nthis season and I'm very excited about it and it's probably not going to be the\nlast candy I'm going to make too so I'm gonna get started right away when you\nmake this you want a very heavy bottom sauce pan and we're going to put the\ningredients in and we're going to get cooking this is I have two stick of\nbutter you this is three tablespoons of water one\ntablespoon of maple syrup three quarters of a cup of sugar we're going to turn\nthe flame on and get it stir it in I'm just gonna gently stir this sugar\ninto the liquid so it doesn't get on so the sugar doesn't get on the side of the\npot I'm gonna stir it for a little while till the sugar dissolves then we're\ngonna let it come to a boil now I'm gonna put the thermometer in and this\nlittle bulb that little red bulb there on the end needs to be underneath the\nliquid which it is the closer it comes to being ready you'll stir it a little\nbit with this flat bottom wooden spoon that really helps to really good scrape\nthe bottom of the pan now I have it on high it's gonna be just fine\nwhen this boils up it's going to boil to about double the amount of the liquid\nthat you see that's how high it's gonna get that's about as high as it's gonna\nget and then it will actually come down a little bit so when you pick your pan\ntake a look at your ingredients and make sure that your pan is at least large\nenough to handle it boiling up but small enough that the bulb of the thermometer\nwill go under liquid you can stir this occasionally and it won't hurt it just\nto keep the temperature even if you start to see it turning a little golden\nbrown in the center just to stir that out and then I always wipe the side of\nmy spoon in the same place every time and I also have this spatula that can\nhandle very high heat so later on when I scrape out the candy I don't have to\nworry about my plastic melting now I've gotten all ready to make the lollipops I\nhave my six reading my trays my cookie sheets with parchment paper on them and\nI'm in-between of the lollipops if they stick I'm gonna fake if the candy flows\ntogether on the lollipops I'm gonna cut them with this and that will be fine if\nit does actually because then it will make it straight lines and then for my\nfinal with the toffee or the some candy in it I put it I'm putting it in a\nteacup so just in case this little ball but some of the candy out it'll just\nflow into here you as your candy cooks it's going to change\nthis nice caramel color and if it seems to get too dark in one spot just go\nahead and pull that away from the side and stir that and keep the color even I\nhave this at a white plate because I like to drop a little bit of candy to\nsee the color I'm gonna cook it until it's done and then I'm gonna see what\ntemperature it is because I really don't go by at the monitor but for you guys\nI'm gonna try to figure it out today it's almost up to 280 most recipes want\nyou to bring it up to 300 I've always found that's a little bit too high for\nthis so you'd have to move your thermometer\ncuz that's really where it gets a little darker and you don't want that burnt\nflavor in your toffee okay this is almost done it's about 290 so I'm gonna\ntake this out turn off the flame we're gonna bring it over see that color I'm\ngonna pour this right into my funnel it's gonna keep cooking I'm gonna get it\nall in there because when you have it sometimes you can transfer candy into\nanother pot that doesn't have such a hot bottom because it will continue to cook\nso I'm just going to open up the little hole by pulling up the stick and run it\nalong the stick be careful because this stuff is\nSuperDuper hot when you're done with all of your candy\npots just put them in some very hot water from the sink and let them soak\nand you shouldn't have to scrub it off just leave them in there for 15 minutes\nall the sugar will be gone that includes everything your your wooden spoon your\nthermometer your plate everything just try to fit it all in there but it's so\nyou need to make sure that your lollipops are completely cool before you\ndip them in chocolate and I have a couple of kinds of chocolate here I'm\ngoing to show you this one these are the little disks and I got this at a candy\nsupply store and you can get this also at a place at a craft shop like Michaels\ncrafts or FATCA pans they usually have wilton which wilton is\na wonderful brand that has a wonderful flavor and yet when you heat them up you\ndon't you just heat them up very slowly like ten like a minute the first for the\nvery first melt and then a half a minute and then a half a minute until and you\nkeep stirring it until they're melted you don't have to worry about tempering\nit this is a little block of very good\nchocolate but I also got in a candy supply store you so I'm going to take this chocolate that\nI've chopped up and take most of the very large pieces and I'm going to melt\nthis extremely slowly I'm going to save some of this out the more finely grated\nwhat I've chopped up once because then I can add that later to cool it down even\nmore but I'm going to do this very slowly like maybe 15 seconds at a time\nand then stir it because if I keep this chocolate below 90 degrees it will\ntemper in my refrigerator it'll be just fine I've already done this for 30\nseconds I've done it for 15 seconds two times and it's starting to get a little\nshiny and it's starting to melt at one point it's just gonna melt right out\neven with the 15 seconds so don't hurry and these glass bowls they also keep the\nthey also warm up a little bit in the microwave so be careful every time I put\nthis in the microwave I use the scraper so I've been scraping the chocolate down\nand adding some chocolate because it started to melt down and I wanted to\nmake sure it stayed cool so this chocolate is beautiful right now\nand I'm going to go ahead I'm going to of course I don't have a deep container\nhere so I'm just gonna go ahead and put the chocolate on like this give it a little decoration you can\nsprinkle some nuts on these one of the reasons i ice these is because the\ntoffee attracts water it's nice just to seal your toffee with something", "chi4GVFJKGw": "alright here we are at Palomar State Park and we're here at the Apple Festival and so we're gonna see what they got should be fun [Music]

containers for the jello shots this is the caramel i like the smokers it's a caramel syrup and of course you need some of course you could get any kind of alcohol you want but i thought it was great to have um like because it's apple apple sorak great and then um this is the only the reason it's it took so long for me to do this video is because i could not find the green apple flavor um jello but i finally found it so i got these two they're in green apple and you pretty much make it just like um it's yellow okay so here we have boiling water but it's only supposed to be two um supposed to be two cups of boiling water so i'm going to pour this in here and make sure we have two cups okay that's two cups and then what we'll take it back over here and what you want to do here is really sugar [Applause] mix this in here i have two i might be able to do so what you want to do here is mix mix mix mix mix mix i actually think i might just use one for now um if you want to do virgin ones you would do two cups of cold water but because i'm doing alcohol i'm gonna do one cup of cold water and one cup of the sorak vodka so now i'm going to add a cup of water cold water and then the last cup is going to be of the rock i'm sorry guys let me get this opened if you want to do virgin ones you would do two cups of cold water but because i'm doing alcohol i'm going to do one cup of cold

video share my video and i will see you guys next time [Music] bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "mKSnbQjixhY": "[Music] hey friends welcome back to my channel so today's video has been really excited because I'm going to be sharing how to make caramel apples with you guys these are surprisingly easy to make but they are so much fun you can be so creative with the toppings and it's just such a fun festive thing to do at this time of the year with a group of friends or they also make a really great gift my mom and sister and I used to make these caramel apples every fall and it just brings back so many warm memories so let's just get started making them the first thing you're going to need obviously is some caramel this is a 5 pound loaf of Peters caramel which is what the pro candy makers use it's just a really good-quality delicious tasting caramel you can use the little car moles that are wrapped in plastic that you find in the candy aisle at the store those will work too but this is just much better I bought this off Amazon I will link it in the description box below this is a 5 pound loaf of caramel which is quite a lot but like I said you can have a caramel apple to being party with your friends which is what I'm gonna do with the rest of this and I think it's just so much fun because everyone can customize their own caramel apple and you come out with amazing professional looking results and it's just such a fun thing to do the next thing you're going to need are some apples obviously you can use Granny Smith which are great it's gonna really tart I like things on the sweeter side so I'm using but any kind of Apple will do you will also need some caramel apple sticks these are wooden bamboo sticks for Michaels and also for Michaels candy melts I have some white candy melts and then also some milk chocolate favorite candy melts I'm going to be using Bowl today but you can buy one or the other so the first thing we're going to do is take our caramel apple sticks and just poke a hole right into the top of the Apple but you don't want to push the stick all the way down probably an inch to two inches just so it's really secure into the Apple and if your apples per kid like this one just want to make sure that the stick goes straight up and down regardless of how the Apple six and I forgot to mention at the beginning I've already washed and dried math so now I'm going to be melting the caramel thing is so big but it is worth it [Music] [Music] okay and you want to get a container that is big enough to dip the apples in but not a ton of space around it you don't have to have too much caramel to dip into so this measuring cup is perfect because I can dip the apples into it easily so I'm just going to add my caramel and then I'm going to just put it in the microwave at half power for one minute intervals and just keep stirring it until it is nice and pliable to dip the apples into so I just put it in for one minute and it looks like it's almost perfect so I'm just gonna add it for a thirty Seconds tomorrow that's a point but do you see how it's just kind of like a like a thick sauce right now okay so now it is perfect and you guys can see it well enough this looks amazing so I'm just gonna mix it to make sure the residual heat takes care of any lumps or anything so I have here a silicone mat like a nice sheet to put the caramel apples on and this will present them from sticking but it's been in the fridge so it's already cooled and that will just help them set up quicker right I hope it's open mat but you can use parchment or whatever you have so now comes the fun part I'm just going to dip the first caramel apple I'm not going to go all the way up to the stick I'm probably going to come you know just about a half inch away from it I'm gonna roll it around in the caramel so that I can get it all over the top then you lift up oh who looks so amazing we're just gonna let it drip for a little bit much and then I'm just gonna stay on ours man I love it I'm just gonna finish the rest the crime level though this one's kind of big okay not quite as pretty but it works [Music] and now that those are done I'm just going to put them in the fridge for 10 minutes or so next we have the toppings and today I'm going to need crushing some Oreos some Reese's Pieces and then also something that I've been craving is salty and sweet together should be also crushing up some pretzels which I think it's gonna be an amazing upset that another one so I'm just going to take a big ziploc bag put in some breo's and I'm so tempted to use these right now I'm going to steal the bag and you can use a hammer or a can of food but what I'm going to use is this is from one of Marcus's toys but it's perfect thing for something like this you're just gonna hammer away you could also use a food processor that would work just as well I think bigger chunks are better with something like this because I want to see that it is an actual Oreo okay that looks great then I'm just going to pour it onto a plate [Music] but you can do many Reese's Pieces hold [Music] okay now that those are repaired I'm going to melt my candy melts you're just going to want to melt them in the microwave in a microwave safe Bowl for about 30 seconds at a time and then just like with the caramel you're gonna want to stir it and then put it in for another 30 seconds until it's a really nice and dipping consistency which is ready but you don't want to overheat it otherwise it'll burn and I would also recommend using plastic spoons with this because the chocolate with the chocolate hardens it's pretty hard to get off those soon so now everything comes together I have my caramel apples my melted chocolate and then one of my toppings these are the pretzels so I'm just going to take the caramel apple and roll it in the chocolate [Music] let it drip a little bit and then while the candy is still melted you're going to want to dip it the bottom first and then roll this height into your coatings and this looks amazing just make sure you get all that chocolate nice and coated I'm just gonna stick a couple on some big pieces on where I want to see them doesn't that look amazing it looks so good and then I'm just gonna stick it back on that same tray and I'm gonna put it in the fridge so I can set the one thing I want to pick the point out is that if your caramel is a little too runny for me heat it too hot it will drip and make these feet you know chill it fast enough so you can leave it but just to kind of eaten it up I'm just going to trim off the bottom and then you can save that caramel for later and then it's really pliable so you can just kind of reshape the bottom to wanted to and I feel like it's fall again I want to leave a little bit of a caramel showing let it drip a little bit and then dip it in my candy and roll it and roll it and I'm going to put this one in the fridge too so the last one is going to go in the white chocolate and we crushed Oreo as you notice I had technical difficulties with this one because the bowl i melted my chocolate and at first was too hot so this was kind of the guinea pig but I had more candy melts we're ready to go so we're still going to use it again I'm just gonna add a few big chunks in key places and pop that in the fridge as well so all the caramel apples are done and they look great but just to polish them a little bit more I melted some candy melts in just a regular sandwich bag and I'm going to just snip a teeny corner off and on the chocolate ones I'm going to drizzle chocolate right good flavor like that whoo they can just I can't wait to try okay should have still had them on the parchment probably and then for the Oreo line I have some melted vanilla notes [Music] and that's it they're so easy they're so fun and they're just so perfect for this time of year I will put a few different topping ideas from the description box below and now I'm going to be showing you how to package them if you're giving them as a gift so from Michaels I just have these large treat bags they're perfect size for the chemical and then these are little treat cups they're really shallow paper trays which are perfect for this and from the dollar store you can get all of us at Michael's but I got this ribbon from the dollar store and it's just a really cute pumpkin orange color and you want to make sure that all of the chocolate has set otherwise you're going to get your bag of dirty first I'm going to put it into a cup and then carefully and then I'm just going to take the ribbon cut each end at an angle and keep I need about 4-5 inches you can cut it longer if you want to tighten the bow I just like to gather it right up the candy stick and then just tie it in a knot [Music] just like that and there you go I will also be putting the steps to making them in the description box below so guys can refer to that as well as

it at the end of the video let's begin these are the ingredients you'll be needing so the first thing you're going to want to do is peel your apples I got this cool gadget that peels it for me and saves me a lot of time especially when you're making like six the apple pies I'll put a link of this item in the description box then you're going to slice your apples it's okay if there's some big pieces small pieces I'm just do your best and cutting then you're going to place it into a bowl then you're going to add the all purpose flour all the seasonings and finn'll extract then take your spatula and you're going to mix it for the crust I actually have a recipe in a link it in the description box and here in the screen and then you're going to cut it into circles I couldn't find my cookie cutter so I had to use a top of the spray bottle so to make this mini pies I have this", "4d0b-tIUsis": "let's make some candy together this is my second\u00a0\ntime making it and i am going to try a new recipe\u00a0\u00a0 i want to try to make the butter toffee so i\u00a0\nhave butter sugar corn syrup i have flavorings\u00a0\u00a0 and the tart and sour and food coloring and let\u00a0\nme show you the molds that i'll be using i have a\u00a0\u00a0 thermometer it's not a candy thermometer\u00a0\nit's a meat to my thermometer but it works\u00a0\u00a0 well and we have the lollipop and the lip\u00a0\nlollipop molds and just regular candy molds now what i'm going to do with my\u00a0\nflavors i'm going to go ahead and mix my\u00a0\u00a0 sugar corn syrup and butter and let it start\u00a0\nto boil up and then what i do is mix my\u00a0\u00a0 flavorings and food colorings in these\u00a0\nlittle cups here and i pour them in at once\u00a0\u00a0 all together once it reaches the 300 degree which\u00a0\nis crack candy stage and then i just um stir it\u00a0\u00a0 and it's done i don't know if i'm able to\u00a0\nshow you all that on here but let me try\u00a0\u00a0 this particular recipe i'm gonna use one whole\u00a0\nstick of butter two cups of sugar and maybe a half\u00a0\u00a0 a cup of corn syrup and see how that turns out the\u00a0\nmain thing is to get it into the crack candy phase\u00a0\u00a0 the first time i made myself call myself making\u00a0\nalcohol lollipops and i put too much alcohol they\u00a0\u00a0 turned out good and they did the job they actually\u00a0\ngot me tipsy but they were soft like toffee okay the butter's melting i'm gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and pour my corn syrup\u00a0\u00a0 that i have measured out already\u00a0\nhalf a cup and then the sugar um\u00a0\u00a0 i am using a stainless steel sauce pan i got it\u00a0\nfrom walmart for like 12 they say the best one to\u00a0\u00a0 use is aluminum and then the second best is copper\u00a0\nbut this one worked just as fine it worked perfect go ahead and put the sugar up and i'll\u00a0\nshow you when it comes the butter is\u00a0\u00a0 boiling let me get the sugar in\u00a0\nand then i'll show you that boil so you also must use a metal spoon go ahead and\u00a0\ngive that a stir real quick just because i want to\u00a0\u00a0 get that sugar dissolved so it can start boiling\u00a0\nup and then i'm going to check the temperature\u00a0\u00a0 i put the top on i'm gonna let it get the boil\u00a0\ngoing and um then we'll put the thermometer in\u00a0\u00a0 the digital thermometer and i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand get my flavoring and food colorings ready\u00a0\u00a0 i want to make two different color\u00a0\ncandies so i'm gonna after i get\u00a0\u00a0 this to a certain temperature\u00a0\nbefore i pour my flavoring in\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna actually pour half of this into\u00a0\nhere so that i can um you know get two flavors while that's some boiling up we'll go ahead\u00a0\nand put our sticks in this i'm gonna have to\u00a0\u00a0 use the smaller sticks i'm glad i got some oh\u00a0\nmaybe i need the smaller sticks for holidays\u00a0\u00a0 yeah let me get my small sticks one more got the\u00a0\nsticks in and on these i think i'm gonna put the\u00a0\u00a0 candy in first and then the stick as it starts\u00a0\nto harden these does not require stick let's go\u00a0\u00a0 check on the um boiling mixture so it's boiling\u00a0\nup and what you do is you don't stir it you just\u00a0\u00a0 let it boil but let's go ahead and um see what the\u00a0\ntemperature is i have to get it to at least 300. let's see how fast it's going to change\u00a0\nit's going fast it's 144 158 170 already 180\u00a0\u00a0 89 always getting on up there okay i'm gonna\u00a0\nlet it get to 300 and then i'm gonna separate\u00a0\u00a0 it let me get my flavors ready i didn't do that\u00a0\nyet but i'm about to but this is moving fast\u00a0\u00a0 okay someone made this with strawberry and the\u00a0\nsour tart and we're gonna put a little red in that\u00a0\u00a0 make some red candy i hope that's enough\u00a0\nand this we're gonna put a little green and at once once this reach let's check this again saying 95 let's check it see how fast it moves up and i wanted to burn you got to get\u00a0\nto about 300 that's going pretty fast let me turn the stove down a\u00a0\nlittle bit once that's all 247 when i get it with 300 guys because i'm\u00a0\nusing one hand oh it's getting up there\u00a0\u00a0 and i'll show you what on\u00a0\nhow i put these flavors in but anyway you get the idea let me get that stirred and i'll be back\u00a0\nand then we got to pour it in and the molds okay guys it definitely got the correct\u00a0\nstage um perfection it started like\u00a0\u00a0 like setting like hardening up\u00a0\nreally quick let me show you\u00a0\u00a0 first time i made it in get the heart cracks\u00a0\ncandy i can tell it did not because it has\u00a0\u00a0 all these little pieces that is hard and\u00a0\nstringy so i'm excited about this the flavor show you the end results before i show the\u00a0\nresults i just want to show you i'm gonna have\u00a0\u00a0 to figure out but these look pretty good these\u00a0\ncircles but i'm gonna have to figure out a way\u00a0\u00a0 to get this stuff in here smooth so i can have\u00a0\nmy proper shape i noticed that it works better\u00a0\u00a0 than the silicone mold i just tasted like\u00a0\npieces from the end guys and this is a very\u00a0\u00a0 very good flavor so if you want to ramp up\u00a0\nyour flavor and your hard candies add butter\u00a0\u00a0 along with flavors and sweet and tart otherwise\u00a0\nit'll just taste like sugar it'll be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 with different colors but it'll\u00a0\njust take like sugar and water so these are the final results and they\u00a0\ncame out really good as far as the texture\u00a0\u00a0 and the flavor came out amazing these are\u00a0\nthe first ones that i made with the alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 they didn't come out so pretty but they were\u00a0\nperfectly flavor i put them in a refrigerator\u00a0\u00a0 and they're a little bit harder but they still\u00a0\nend up being a toffee like texture before you\u00a0\u00a0 finish eating it but it's delicious and\u00a0\nyou can actually feel the alcohol in it\u00a0\u00a0 these definitely got to um crack\u00a0\ncandy stage the green is really good\u00a0\u00a0 but the um red i put a little bit too much flavor\u00a0\nin it that flavoring is really concentrated so you\u00a0\u00a0 have to be very very careful and light-handed\u00a0\nwith the flavorings but that tart sour that\u00a0\u00a0 you can be heavy-handed with it i really like the\u00a0\nflavor of the green but i'm getting better at it thank you all for watching please\u00a0\nlike share and subscribe and have\u00a0\u00a0 a wonderful day night evening morning\u00a0\nwhatever time you're in at the moment", "TCUz7oVD2sA": "hello everyone and welcome back to royalty folks today I'm going to be making my first ever batch of soap in the new house it's very exciting and what's even more exciting is that we're doing some cupcake soaps today I have not done these in a really long time I don't know I just got a bee in my bonnet so the color I have in here is mantis green from nursery soap supplies and then I have a pigment white lip liquid this is from TKB trading this is just acting as titanium dioxide for me because I'm out and the only thing it is is titanium dioxide in castor oil so it's specifically designed for people that make liquid lip glosses or if they're doing like lipsticks and stuff like that but that's not what we're using it for obviously so this green has been scented with nature's garden green apple explosion and if you want like a Jolly Rancher green apple type fragrance oil this is the one for you I will also be mixing this up with my brand new stick blender from bramble berry Thank You bramble berry they heard that I am who's having some stick blender problems and needed a new one so they sent this one to my p.o box I am so appreciative and let me tell you guys it's not just like a low and a high setting they've got like all these knobs up here that you can like speed it up the power and stuff it's very intuitive I feel very fancy so the first thing I'm going to do here is kind of mix up the fragrance oil in to the oil I've already put the fragrance oil and most of this time I wait and put that in after but because I'm doing cupcakes today it really doesn't matter I will pour them very very fast on the lowest setting the stick blender is like super OOP this was super strong so now I'm just going to pour in my light water solution I'm going to be making 12 cupcakes today so if you're using my recipe down in the description box below you need to do 25 ounces of oil that is what will give you 12 cupcakes so now let's mix this up [Music] oh okay this stick blunder is so strong you guys I was having to hold it up off of the bottom with two of course when I work in bigger batches that probably won't be necessary but a little difficult for this one let's pour these into the silicon molds okay so we're just going to pour this all the way in so it's completely full up and you probably notice with the green went from kind of a bright green to a little bit kind of a khaki green and that's just what happens with these green colors whenever the soap is in its liquid state and then once it fits for about 24 hours it will go back to the proper green color now for every batch of soap that you make and every recipe you will need a different amount to fill up 12 silicon cupcake liners but with the one that I have down below you need the 25 ounces I just wanted to clarify that I didn't want you to use your own recipe and then be like hey that wasn't enough or hey that was way too much because and every recipe is different and I like mine to be really really full so I always go back after they've sat a second and add a little bit more in if you don't want to do that probably using 23 ounces will do your prop up the silicone liners that I have here are from Amazon you can get them in a multitude of places but I prefer Amazon because I have Amazon Prime so the shipping is super super fast and they always have really competitive prices I also wanted to talk just really quickly to tell you guys that I am now an Amazon affiliate it really is such it was such a celebration to me when I found out that I had been approved for that program but I did want to make like old disclosure to you guys because I didn't want you know to seem sneaky or anything like that Amazon affiliate just means that I make money from the links that I leave in the description box you guys know I leave links in all of my videos in all the description box I'm always linking it to the products that I use but it just means now that I actually get to make some money from those links so that you know goes to supporting this channel in supporting my own husband and my little baby fund and all that us where that money is going but still I wanted to like I said keep a very very very open disclosure to you guys I am making money whenever you click on those links or whenever you buy things from those links kind of scrapey scrapey the bowl a little bit this stuff smells so good you guys is the first time I've used this fragrance oil I've kind of had it sitting around just waiting to be used you smell this in here Caleb yeah strong now that my friends is a professionally straight Bowl he now I'd like to let these sit a little while I know some people go right in and put that piping on but I'm gonna let these sit for about ten minutes before I mixed up my soap frosting so while my piping is setting up I thought I might show you these cute little apple embeds they actually came in an embed mold that I got from Kroger which is my local grocery store but I bet I can find them online they're a little ice cube trays and it has like a pineapple and apple a pear and I think a lemon yeah so it has like four different fruits in it really really convenient they were super cheap like two bucks or something so I just put in the same color that I used for the bottom of the soap cupcakes colored it with a little soap paint up here so it looks like it has an apple stem and yeah that's what the embeds looks like okay so my piping is pretty good and set up it could be a little bit harder but sometimes with cupcakes is better to pipe a little bit softer just so that you know you have enough time to finish all of them I am using a brand new tip that I purchased from Amazon and you know what's really funny is that I actually saw Karen from Eden secret use this like two days I want to say after I bought it and all like a day that's what this like this lot and if you don't know who Karen is I will leave a link to her YouTube channel down below she's actually one of the first people that encouraged me to try piping my soap so yeah she was definitely pivotal in my soap making journey I love the this this is amazing and of course I'm using the coupler and the bag from the royalty so piping set and I know I'm going to get asked it so I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now to use a soap cupcake cut it in half whenever you receive it just take a knife and slice it in half and use the flat side if you feel like it's too awkward to hold I haven't piped cupcakes in a long time and this tip pretty sure a beginner would make perfect cupcakes with this tip it's so easy to use okay so now to put the little tops on I'm just going to go around and pull up and because of the embed I'm using I don't really need a super pokey top because it's going to kind of flatten it anyway what it looks like I didn't have quite enough piping for this last hortence it's been a while since I've made so cupcakes again you know now I'm going to take some of this iridescent diamond dust this is from rustic essentials I got it in a goodie bag a long long time ago and I just recently found it when I was unpacking which is great I'm kind of out of glitter also I do add fragrance oil to the piping whenever I do cupcakes because that's like the basically most of the bar so it does need to be scented I don't normally do that for my cold process loaves but I do to the cupcake so now just going to take my little little bed here sit right on top embeds are another really good way to hide flaws in a soap cupcake you can kind of any place that has you know like a little dent or maybe the piping looks slightly off-center you can just cover it up by sticking it in bed in okay you guys I'm so sorry my camera shut off because it was out of batteries but this is what the soaps look like when I have finished them and as you can maybe see now that I've zoomed in really close there's little green specks on it those are forest green jojoba beads those are from bramble berry and then this little caramel drizzle is just Kings gold mica also from ramble bury that I have mixed with some clear melt and pour so it kind of looks like a Karen Apple Caleb said these kind of reminds him of Snow White which I thought was very cute okay so I'm going to be back tomorrow to unmold these and also question of the day should I make more cupcakes that is the question yes two more cupcakes or no two more cupcakes and just go back to doing my artisan soap so if you want more cupcakes if you want to them to be in the shop let me know you can click the upper right hand corner of the screen and go vote while we are back the next day to unmold these little so cupcake so what you do for this is peel off the silicon liner which of course can be used time and time again I don't recommend using this for baking after you have used them for soap if you like to use these for baking get yourself a set of these that is separate from your soap making set I'm just going to pull it right off as you can see the color here is pretty pale that's kind of what I wanted so that the Apple would stand out but you could always make that a little bit darker if you enjoyed this video please give it a big thumbs up subscribe to the channel maybe even leave me a comment down below and don't forget to vote on whether or not I should make more silly cupcake and until next time I hope you have an absolutely loyal week and by fail [Music]", "Q06WBT-0CXc": "welcome back to my channel everybody it has been a while but today is Wednesday and is

the house but you are more than welcome to use caramel syrup if you would like so first we're just gonna dip the cup in the caramel syrup our caramel candy just like that and these are some pretty big glasses I got these from Walmart and then I just put some in a piping bag and I'm gonna put it in the inside of the cup just like that you can do it any kind of design you want but I wanted my Cornwall to stick so then I have my shaker and I've ice and I got this one wall more - I'm gonna be using the sour apple pucker and then I'm gonna be using the kiss caramel Smirnoff that's anybody

to thank you all for sending me your intros I've received well over 50 and there's probably no way I'm gonna be able to use all of them however what I've done for this video is I putting one at the beginning and I'm gonna put two at the end because I think they are really good and I want you to see them so the beginning intro is by Baker watch oh mama gave you and I put two of them at the end of the video one by Gleek out 62 and another by doggy paintball so here we go let's see what's cookin let's get the facts let's see what's cooking it's time for yo-yo max twelve hello everyone today we're doing taffy Apple or caramel apple cupcakes the recipe and greens you're gonna see on the video or for a half recipe but the recipe in the description box and the recipe amounts I give you on this video are gonna be the for the full recipe forgot to turn the camera on when I mixed up my dry ingredients so in that bowl is one a three quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of baking soda a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half a teaspoon of salt mix that together put it aside then in a large bowl place 1/2 cup of vegetable oil 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar 1 egg and 1 cup of applesauce unsweetened applesauce and stir that together as I knew I said I was doing a half recipe on the video but when it's one egg I'm not going to put half an egg I put a whole lake in there regardless then I'm stirring in the flour mixture blending it all together with a spoon and then pouring it into a ziplock bag cut the corner of the ziplock bag up and then I'm going to put the batter into some mini muffin tins and you're gonna fill them up to about 2/3 full and then bake them at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes up clean now I have two kinds of mini muffin tins I have the darker one which are smaller and then I have this aluminum pan which is a bit larger that's the larger one and then I'll show you what the smaller one looks like I think that for this recipe he's better to use the smaller ones rather than the larger ones you're going to need some craft caramels or these little individually wrapped caramels you need 314 ounce packages of those you're gonna put them in a bowl and you're gonna add 1/2 cup of milk or cream you're gonna put it in the microwave heating on high to three minutes and stirring every once in a while until it's melted and smooth you also need some chopped up nuts if you'd like you're supposed to use peanuts as far as the recipe goes but I have some chopped up cashews is what I'm using on the side then you take the muffin after it's been cooled take it out of the muffin liner insert a popsicle stick and then you're going to spoon the caramel mixture over top of the cupcake and I recommend you start at this this part where the stick is inserted into the cupcake it just helps it hold on to the cupcake a lot better cuz these have a tendency to want to fall off and once it's coated with the caramel mixture you can let some of the excess drip off and then if you'd like you can just roll it into the truck nuts and then place it on to you like I'm doing here silicone mat or you can put it on some waxed paper or on a greased cookie sheet and then you're gonna let those harden either at room temperature like I am here now or you can put them in the refrigerator to help us be that along a little bit and here's a close-up of another one insert the popsicle stick don't go all the way through go about half way and then just spoon the caramel over top another way you can do these are just to put them on a cookie sheet and just drizzle some of the caramel over top if you don't want it completely coated with the with the caramel I found that the caramel actually hard very quickly once it was put on to the cupcake and even it was hard to get the chopped nuts to stick to it another tip I'm going to give you is when you I recommend that you serve these immediately or keep them in the refrigerator because I left mine on the countertop overnight and as you can see I put them into little paper cups just to hold them and those paper cups up she didn't stick to the caramel the first day next day however I guess because of the moisture in the cupcake the caramel kind of oozed off stuck to the paper like crazy and pretty much there was not much you could do with them you had to break them apart to get them out so serve them the same day or keep them refrigerated in order to keep their nice shape the way they are right now the actual cupcake itself underneath the caramel is very good you can taste the Apple you can taste the cinnamon and it goes very well with the caramel of course as you might expect so I think these would make a really cute little treat to make it around Halloween time as well or in the fall so tack the apple or caramel apple cupcakes give them a try let's see what's cooking let's get the facts let's see what's cooking it's time for yo-yo max

a jolly rancher lollipop normally I don't do lollipops but for my friend Shawn I've made it an exception what's good about it the app or flavor seems to be long lasting and i give it a seven out of 10 hey guys next time bye", "M3d2G8uTMRA": "hi baking buddies I'm Jen Jones welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be showing you how to make two different types of candy apples now the first way I'm going to be showing you is more of a traditional way when we're going to use sugar and we're going to dip them into it but to make it a little bit more interesting we're going to be using tons of color so what I've got here is a beautiful black one I've got a beautiful blue and a nice light purple and in the video I'm gonna be showing you how to make the pink one now you can use any gel paste color to make any color of the rainbow that you want to with this technique now my second technique I'm going to be showing you is how to make Jolly Rancher covered candy apples they're amazing and on top they've got rock candy and they're filled with glitter as well so what I've got here is the purple one the grape flavor I've got the red and it's like the watermelon and the cherry colors you can find and then I'm gonna be showing you the blue raspberry in the video and you can use any of the Jolly Rancher flavors let's get started on this tutorial to make our candy coated apples we're going to be using one cup of water we need half a cup of light corn syrup you can use regular colored corn syrup if you only have that but it does add a little yellow tinge we're going to need nice red juicy apples I like red better just simply for the coating and the coloring now we're also going to be using some rock candy to kind of decorate the Apple and you can also use sprinkles to decorate the Apple if you're going to use a different color of candy coating change up the color of these we're going to need some apple candy sticks and we're going to need three cups of granulated sugar and then for our coloring we're going to be using some white coloring and then like I said pink but it can be any color you want so the first thing we want to do is prep our apples so make sure your Apple is washed and cleaned and completely dry then you're going to take your Apple stick and you're just going to insert it right where the stem is right directly down into the Apple just like that so you want to repeat that for all of your apples so I have sugar placed in a pan here and I'm going to turn my element up to medium-high I want it to be quite warm and I'm going to put the water into the pot as well and into there and then also the corn syrup and then I'm going to let it heat up until it is around 300 degrees or about between 250 and 300 Fahrenheit once your sugar mixture has come to temperature what we're going to do is squeeze in some of that white coloring sometimes it does kind of like bubble up so just be careful and we're just going to stir it gently there's the bubbling happening and so you want to be careful you don't want to over stir because you want to do your best that you can in order to try to avoid as many bubbles as you can there will be bubbles at least I found it extremely difficult to get rid of them all so once you've got that white color mixed in and I'm wanting to work fairly quickly here I don't want to waste I don't want the temperature of the candy to cool very much so it's bubbling again if you want a flavour add it in at this point that you could do that any candy oil or like a traditional flavour would be cinnamon that sort of thing so I'm just mixing in the pink coloring in here so again it's just a beautiful nice bright pink we've got going on here stirring that in so the temperature of the candy is dropping as soon as you take it from the heat it does start to drop i heated it to 250 Fahrenheit and that's gonna give a tiny bit of a more chewy rather than like one of those crack your teeth hard ones so once I've got it mixed in I'm just going to take my pot and I'm going to turn it on an angle like that and then with my Apple I'm gonna place my apple inside and I'm just going to roll it inside the candy and I'm just going to coat the Apple completely then you see I've got a piece of silicone mat here down and I'm just going to take it off let it drip off a little bit and then place it on to the silicone mat to cool and harden completely once your apples have cooled completely and the candy is hardened you'll know that there because you'll be able to lift them up off your parchment or your silicon mat without them sticking that's kind of the indicator so now I'm just going to take some piping gel if you don't have piping gel you could also use corn syrup for this and you had corn syrup in the recipe so you might have that on hand so I'm just painting over the stem here I did fine or around the stem I did find that if the candy completely filled in the hole and touched the stem I found that the it kind of started to bubble from there so I would try to leave a little bit of space around the stem if you can sometimes you kind of control it that candy is doing and it's so hot that you have to be super careful and work fast too so I'm just getting these little sprinkles added on here and then I'm going to repeat the exact same thing for the rock candy around this one and just take that piping gel again or you can take the e corn syrup it's nice and sticky the corn syrup is a little bit runny ER so it doesn't work so well with with rock candy but it does work fine with the little sprinkles and again just pile on some rock candy in here to make the Jolly Rancher candy apples we're going to be using Jolly Ranchers you want them separated by color here I have 50 blue raspberry ones pulled out you can use about 50 of them gives about three apples in total that will it will coat about three apples so we're also going to be using some rock candy or you could use sprinkles or more edible glitter and we're going to be putting edible glitter in the side of the Jolly Rancher mixture as well I've got a recipe for the edible glitter in the description box for you we're going to be using apple sticks and then of course we need some apples so I have my 50 Jolly Ranchers unwrapped and placed into a cake pan you can also use whatever kind of like ovenproof Bowl that it will be safe to put the Jolly Ranchers into I'm going to put them into a 350 degree preheated oven for 15 minutes while the candy is melting in the oven you can prep your apples wash and clean them and remove as much of the stem as you can and then insert the Apple stick into the top right straight down after about 15 min you can take the can out of the oven and then you want to sprinkle the glitter on top doesn't matter what order you do it and I just went with glitter that's of a similar like shade to this one and then obviously minus the gold and the silver and then with a oven mitt on I'm going to stir that in and once I've got it stirred in and incorporated I'm going to pop it back into the oven for about five more minutes once you've resaw Fionn door real iqua fide your candy you can pick it up with a mitt and then I'm just turning it on its side here letting it kind of gather there and then I'm going to twirl the Apple into that like that perfect this is a little bit thicker than the other one was with just the regular candy mixture but this comes out really really cool so I'm going to just roll this and then set it on to either parchment paper or a silicon mat and you can let that harden completely once the Jolly Rancher is cooled you can take some piping gel and place the piping gel over top of the edge there and then all over where the Apple is exposed and this is just you're using this for just like a glue instead of it being it's just an edible glue here basically it's gonna help the rock candy stick to it and you can use edible glitter you can use sprinkles you could use whatever sorts of little thing up there you don't have to use anything at all it just kind of seals it up and I think it looks it adds a little nice to be touch to it so there you go baking buddies how to make two different ways to make candy apples now I changed up the sticks a bit just to add like a little bit more excitement because like Jolly Rancher glitter is not enough so over here on my black one what I did was i just used a straw paper straw and i put it over top of the apple stick and it worked perfectly and it goes so well with the black and then the blue one here i've just got the regular ones so you guys can see the contrast and then here I went to my mother-in-law's apple tree and I cut some of the branches and I've used those as the stick for these apples so it's totally up to you definitely not something you have to do but it kind of makes it a cooler presentation let me know in the comments which type of the candy apple you think you would like the best and I will see you guys all again next time bye", "SpZFf8PwAbU": "(banging) (beep) - See, it's not that hard. (upbeat music) First, make sure you have\nyour equipment ready. Yes, there is an old-school\ntrick of throwing the caramel in some ice\nwater and see if it hardens, but to me that's not accurate enough. This is the time when this\nbad boy comes in handy. Dammit. Those thermometers are (beep). Next you'll need to have\na baking sheet lined with wax paper. We know that sticky stuff\ndoesn't stick to wax. Aw (beep). Finally, you'll need some craft\nsticks or lollipop sticks. The thicker, the better to\nhold these heavy apples. (banging) Another tip to remember is to make sure you\ndon't have anywhere to be for at least 20 to 30 minutes. You can't leave the caramel alone when we start that process. (sad music) First step is to wash your apples. Next, dry them off. Nothing is going to stick to a wet apple. I love using Granny Smith apples for making caramel apples\nbecause the tart, sourness of the apple goes great with\nthat rich, sweet caramel. I'm going to place these on\na tray or a baking sheet. You should use a pairing\nknife to remove the stem. It should pop right out. Next, stick your craft\nstick or a lollipop stick right where that stem was. It's not supposed to be difficult. Use a little bit of force. Apparently I'm not strong enough. We need this to look real easy. (banging) You can use your pairing\nknife to get the hole started to help make the stick easier to go in. Next, we're gonna chill\nthese in the refrigerator while we make the caramel. If the apple is cold, it will help the caramel\nstick better later. Now it's time to make the caramel. A lot of classic caramel\nrecipes start with white sugar. I like to use brown sugar, it helps get to that perfect color sooner. Two cups of brown sugar,\na stick of butter, sweetened, condensed milk, corn syrup. I like to add a couple pinches of salt and that's all that goes in now. We'll add a little vanilla at the end. We're gonna get this\ngoing over medium heat. I'm pretty much gonna be\nstirring the whole time. Try to keep the sides of the\npan as clean as possible. Keep most of the caramel\ndown at the bottom. You can start by melting your butter and sugars together first, but as long as you're stirring\neverything constantly, you shouldn't have a problem\nif you put everything in at the beginning. Now that everything has come together and it's nice and melted, it's starting to simmer just a little bit, I'm gonna put the candy thermometer in. I'm gonna let it do it's thing. We're about 180 now. You wanna get to about 240, 245 where it's getting into\nthe hard ball stage. That way it's going to set up nicely, but it's still gonna have a\nlittle bit of chewiness to it. If you get to the soft crack\nstage, you've gone too far. Smelling like the fair. I'm gonna show you the super simple hack way right after this. I feel like it's gotten too hot. It got too hot. Damn it. Those thermometers are (beep). Okay, I've removed it from the heat and I'm going to stir in\na little bit of vanilla. But let me warn you, it will\nbubble up just a little bit. Time for the apples. Okay, my apples are nice and cold. But what you wanna do is\ndry them off one more time because a little condensation might have built while they\nwere in their refrigerator. Okay, here we go. Oh, look at that. Let some of the excess drip off. Or drip down. You have to hold it up\nfor a couple seconds so that it doesn't all fall off and we're gonna place it\ndown on our wax paper. Your first couple might be\na little thinner in coating than the last couple and that's because the caramel starts to cool off really quickly. So you do kind of need to work quickly. A great thing that I saw is\nyou can make your caramel ahead of time and then just\nkeep it on a low crock pot and the kids can dip their own. It's a fun little food craft. There's something about\ndoing things the classic way, but don't forget I'm gonna show you the easy mama way in just a minute. So if you wanna add a\nlittle crunchy coating to the bottom for just a little decoration or because you like the perfect bite, then get some toppings ready and we're gonna roll them in the toppings before they completely sit. I'm a classic girl so I\nlike to go for the peanuts. I might of waited too long. You know, I'm just failing this one. Halloween, festive sprinkles are cute. Aw, yeah. That one's mine. They're already setting\nup but they're still a little sticky to the touch. So, to finish the setting process, you wanna refrigerate them\njust a little bit longer. See? It's not that hard. As promised, a much easier, more updated way to make these\ncaramel apples especially if you're making them with children. Using caramel candy. Y'all, it's this plus a little milk and you've got that whole\nprocess that we did before. Add them to a glass measuring cup. This is gonna help the dip process later. To that you're gonna add just\na couple tablespoons of milk and head to the microwave. We're gonna microwave it for one minute, give it a stir, and then hit\nit for another minute or so. That's what I'm talking about, two minutes and we have caramel sauce. Give that a good stir to be\nsure it's all one, smooth sauce. And we'll grab our apples. Okay, dry your apple off, these are cold, and just do the same process. If it starts to slide off really quickly, then your caramel's a little bit hot. You can just let it set up\nfor another minute or so. That's what I'm talking about. No matter which way you choose\nto make your caramel apples, they definitely bring out the fun of fall. Can that just be it? - [Man] Yeah, that's good.", "do3QwBJmGK4": "hi all city candy fans laura here and nikki and we are here today to try the caramel apple sugar babies so sugar babies have been around for a very long time and they've got a nice little twist with the caramel apple flavor really good for fall for halloween thanksgiving time this is a feeder box so great if you want a little snack while you're watching your movies or not any old time everything is good any old time all right so oh they're green they are green look at that i guess they are apple they almost look like about the size of a chocolate covered raisin yeah like a butter what's inside if you're not a raisin fan is even better i'm going to bite one in half apple flavor right away yeah really strong tart if you like tart tart apple that's good if you've ever had those caramel apple lollipops reminds me a lot of that and then a little bit of caramel on the inside obviously it's a more of the the apple flavored coating but it's kind of a nice combination definitely not enough caramel for me but i'm a sweet person not a tart person and i'm a tart person um i like that i usually i usually don't like a green apple flavor um it's got enough tart that it's very pleasant apples first caramel kicks in later that's a great fall treat so if you think you would like these give them a try they're on our

than normal definitely edible definitely gonna get me hopped up on some sugar and I'm not gonna say no to it but you know I'm still going with the double stuff regular ones so Oreos out", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "qHVgLnuISyQ": "how to make karma decorations in a pan add two cups of granulated sugar and cook it over medium this technique used is called dry method because it doesn't require any water it's the easiest but the most suitable technique in this case the edges will start to melt first but don't worry you just have to stir it and it will start melting Italy with this technique you're allowed to steer your karma as much as you want continue to bring all the method sugar to the top and eventually will become one big pot of caramel don't worry about the lumps you will all melt away this method is pretty great because no matter what you do you will ruin your car unless you burn it of course as soon as it looks is look like this remove from the heat the first decoration I'm gonna do is a sugar cage with some vegetable oil I'm gonna coat the back of my ladle for the sugar cage the caramel should still be hot so we can create fine strings dip your spoon into the caramel lift it up and in a zigzag motion start coating the back of your ladle to create a firmer structure you have to zigzag vertically and then horizontally the hotter your karma the thinner will be so it's easier to create this decoration with a hot caramel now cut off all the excess on the edges that dripped away just like this and now must immediately you can release it from the ladle and here you have your gorgeous sugar cage this can go on top of a cake or even covering completely a small pastry to caramelize fruits it's super super simple you just have to dip them in a warm caramel and place them to rest over a parchment paper or wax paper they will harden within minutes and add a nice look to your fruits and don't forget that after caramelized a fish should never be in contact with any liquids or humidity Ori will melt now comes my favorite caramel decoration caramelizing nuts insert the tip of a toothpick in the nut of your preference I love to use hazelnuts here because they look very elegant dip them in a warm but not hot caramel make sure you coat all the sides of it and once you do you just have to lift your nut and this caramel continues this train will form place them in the edge of your counter top with some weight over the toothpick as they cool the sugar continues to pull itself down creating this amazing teardrop effect place them upside down on top of cakes and you will have the most elegant cake in the planet and now with the sugar almost cold I'm able to pull it easily and create sugar strings pinch the caramel with your fingers or a fork and start pulling this sugar as long as your sugars to warm you can pull it to the infinite really you can turn it into a ball the size of planet Earth if it starts breaking easily you just have to reheat this caramel over low heat you can reheat this many many times but don't forget that to be able to pull the sugar the caramel has to cool down a little bit a little cleaning tip but after you're done the caramel and the pin will become like a hard rock let it soak in water overnight and you remove it easily today you learn how to make all sorts of caramel decorations for more tips and

unorthodox as far as the monday milk reviews go and i know what you're thinking me that's not a flavored milk you can't do that it's my show i do what i want if you'll look very very closely to any of cocoa pops's advertising hmm what is it just like a chocolate milkshake only crunchy so it is close enough and i define it as something worth looking at i don't need your criticism and i'm gonna look at it anyway the cocoa pops golden gay time is the second time i've seen coco pops do a little bit of an alternate flavor there was the white chocolate which don't try it not worth your time but golden gate time is the chocolate mixed with toffee so this is going to be a really interesting product to try let's get straight into it shall we that jump cut definitely wasn't me fetching scissors after forgetting to grab some let's open this up all right get rid of that let's give it a smell from the box wow okay wow that smell is really really really strong like it really hits you in the face with that aroma and it's not a bad thing that just shows how flavorful this product really is let's pour it in now in terms of odors that you discover you can definitely smell that toffee being really really present the chocolate was a little bit masked i didn't get much of a smell of it so let's try from the glass it's definitely got a hard preference towards the toffee the chocolate isn't as noticeable as you can maybe see within the glass it looks like there's a bit of a bias for the toffee flavored ones there's not much chocolate in here let's pour the milk in and start brewing the milkshake [Music] okay so one test that we're definitely gonna have to do is try it when it's crunchy [Music] i'm gonna be real doesn't really remind me too much of a golden gay time yes you can taste the toffee the toffee's not bad by the way that's still quite a nice product but i don't think of golden gay time when i try it honestly i think they're struggling to escape the flavor of rice bubbles i think that the flavour of the rice is really quite strong chocolate masks that taste really effectively but i think the toffee isn't doing as good a job to mask the rice flavor which is a bit of a shame i don't think i would really rate it higher than original cocoa pops coco bops did i just say cocoa bops it definitely has that presence of the toffee i think i'd only give this maybe a seven it's it's not exactly what i prefer i i really like honey crispix for example even though i don't often have them i tend to usually try and opt for less sugary cereals nowadays so if you're wondering where you can find these i've just found it in woolworths but i'm pretty sure this is going to also be available in kohl's and probably iga as well frankly though i don't think you're going to struggle to find it i've been seeing this all around let's go for a taste of the milk now that's really nice i mean it's obviously the second hand flavor but you definitely get way more of that toffee taste it's it's super super sweet i did purposefully probably put in a little bit less milk than you should have because i wanted to very quickly get that concentrated flavor but you know as as a milk to finish off after you finish the cereal it's pretty good i think my bias for chocolate is gonna show here and i might say that i still prefer the regular cocoa pops as a little bit of variation it's quite nice i could very happily eat a bowl of this i think i'm gonna have to give this one overall for considering the cereal and the milk afterwards the flavored milk after the cereal has been finished i think i'm gonna give it an eight it's pretty nice but i wouldn't classify it as a top tier cereal this is one of those really rare treats but if you're going to go down that route of really rare treats the stuff which i would prefer over it like a honey crispix for example is pretty hard to beat that about wraps us up for this week's episode of the monday milk review thank you very much

miss grandma Smith but you can use whatever can you like and they're gonna get our melon baller and we're just gonna scoop out little balls it's not Julia Child's is it oh yeah okay scoop out some cute little balls with your little melon baller I like this little part was kind of fun doing that next I have some little sucker sticks I have my little pan lined with parchment paper you're ready to go take your little sucker sticks and insert them into your little apple bowls all right none don't let the little sticks go all the way through like this don't do that I'm gonna tell you why in just a second okay look at our cute little Apple suckers they're so cute okay now we're gonna melt some caramel now I know somebody gonna say then I know how my caramel if you want to do a homemade caramel go to my blog I have the recipe we're gonna add a little bit of heavy cream to kind of give a nice smooth taste go ahead and melt it over low heat and there's that shot that almost got me in trouble on my last video you guys I'll try to tell you I'd do this shot in all my videos because I was wearing a sweater dress some people couldn't handle it mm-hmm the boo don't laugh the Buddha don't laugh all right so go ahead and just melt that camera like that that looks luscious and gorgeous never gonna dry off these little suckers these little Apple suckers we want them to be really dry when they go into that caramel so it will stick to it okay go ahead and dunk it right look at luscious look at that yes darling beautiful darling and now go ahead and dunk it into the ice water for a few seconds just to kind of firm it up a little bit okay and then I like to go ahead and just dry it off a little bit like that right there perfect now when you put them in the caramel try to get them some of the camera on the stick too they can to seal it in because we have that hole right there and we don't want this water to go down into the hole and that's why you don't want to put that stick all the way through okay that's perfect now normally I work right next to my freezers when they come out of the water and dry them off I just plop them right into the but yeah today okay whatever alright so when they come out of the water and you drive the mob now's the time to dump them into whatever you're going to dump them in some sprinkles some walnuts whatever oh my god you guys I did walnuts and it was so nasty it tasted like lightning bugs but yeah it was gross don't do walnuts and if you skip that water step here's what I happened I'll straight up disaster dolan so don't skip the water step you got to do it i'm gonna place these in the freezer to let them harden up just a little bit more and then we're done easy I love little easy little crafty things like this okay but

bye", "um0Qt1757HY": "so you're at your basic cake this isn't anything fancy this is just a straight out of the box cake and then I've just got your standard Betty Crocker icing then you'll need your lollipop sticks and then it got chocolate-covered almonds chocolate melt ease a milk chocolate and then I got candy corn this one came with the standard white orange and yellow and then the white orange and brands will switch some of them up pretzel sticks legs and then in here I've got the orange chocolate drops and then the hearts for the dangly things from their neck it comes in this package here I think you got your cake crumbles you're going to add your icing so just there's no set amount that you need to add put add as much start with a little amount and then add in so usually I just do say two scoops and then see how that works for you so first you start off mixing it off the spoon and then you're going to have to kind of get in there and get it all mixed in once you've got it to this consistency so a little sticky but not like soaking and what you're going to do you're going to take a mount in your hand and you're going to roll it and at first that it kind of won't feel like it's getting together don't feel like it's kind of a blog but just keep going past that point and it'll start to come together that and then you're just going round it into a ball and then you'll do that for all of them I like to put mine on a tray on a parchment paper and then little throw it in the fridge for about half an hour to an hour so they firm up nicely so once you take your ball out of the fridge or the freezer you're going to grab your lollipop stick I'm going to dip it in a little bit into your chocolate you're just going to stick it in and give that a couple seconds just to set up so the chocolate it's just a little bit there before you stick it in once it's ready you're going to want to dip it in and you're going to want to go straight down don't move it or shake it just goes three down and then come straight back up and then what you're going to want to do is shake off the excess this may take a little bit Spencer will set up you're going to want to grab your truck cover comment you'll want to do it more on the flat side and find the side that you want you're on it usually push it hold it for a second urge should be good and then we're going to do five candy corn so put one in the middle and grab your pretzel beach already and then grab just an extra lollipop stick dip it into your chocolate just a little bit first we're going to pull the beach just fold it for a secondary and then we're going to add grab your heart flip it upside down then grab the other end of your lollipop stick and we're going to dip it into we're going to do the way me and then we will give it a second and dry and multi the black or the eyes and then walk again you", "HvKJz4M585c": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade rock candy we recently made a cake Penguins of Madagascar that used lots of rock candy and I was reading through the comments and people were asking of ways that they could make it themselves at home so I put together this video for you so let's get started so we don't need many ingredients to make the raw candy we need just 1 cup of water 3 cups of white granulated sugar now these parts are optional I've just got some colouring you can also use food coloring for this I have gel paste out in front and I also have some different flavorings and you can use them or omit them it just depends if you want your rock candy to be flavored and then we're going to be growing the rock candy on these little wooden sticks you could also use popsicle sticks or you could also use cake pop sticks so the first thing we're going to do is bring our cup of water to a boil which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit so once the water is boiling just turn it down slightly and then by the 1/2 cup we're going to add the sugar so I'm just going to add 1/2 cup here and probably start off with a cup here and then I'm just going to stir it and I'm going to keep stirring and letting the sugar in here dissolve while I'm stirring it we're gonna get the 3 cups of water in or sorry the 3 cups of sugar into the water which is going to saturate it and that's going to be how the rock candy forms so I'm just gonna keep stirring and adding the sugar and it looks like it's dissolved from that first addition so I'm just going to add some more and then keep going so I have all of my sugar in it's nice and thick and the sugar is dissolved into the water mixture so now I'm going to just give it a final couple stirs and I'm going to set it to the side for about 15 minutes to let it cool and in the meantime I'm going to set up the where the rock candy is going to grow so what we need to do next is give a surface for the rock candy to grow on so I'm taking my wooden sticks and I'm just dipping them into the water here just dipping the stick and making it wet and then I'm going to roll it in this white extra sugar so you don't need too much you can tap it off and this is just going to give the rock candy something to stick to and so like I said it's gonna help it grow so just stick it in the water and then dip it into the sugar so we're gonna let those dry and wait for our mixture to slightly cool so what I've got set up are small narrow glasses and if you you can use anything that's kind of like long and cylinder like this in order to help grow the rock candy and what you're going to do is if you want one to be color just gonna put a drop in to the bottom you don't need very much because it is quite a small amount so I've got some blue and some pink coming in here and if you want coloring or sorry if you want flavoring if you want to have one flavour for all of your rock candy you could put it in while before you take it off the heat but I want to show you how to make different flavors so I'm just going to put a little drop as small as I can get here into that blue one there and then change the flavor and put another drop in the second one so this third one that's on my right here I'm just going to leave it plain because the clear rock candy also looks kind of cool so I've transferred my sugar mixture to a container that I can pour from and the mixture is still hot you just want to make sure you've given it a little time to cool down slightly so we're going to do is just pour into my containers here and then I'll give them a stir so I'm filling it you want to leave a little bit of room for this for the stick to go in there and just give it a little stir so it mixes up all of the color and the flavor I'm just going to repeat that with all three and then I'll show you what to do with the sticks so what I have are large clothes pegs you could also use the regular sized ones these ones are just like because they have a little hole in the middle which just happens to fit perfectly with the stick so what you want to do now is you want to put the stick right into the center of the mixture but you don't want it to touch the bottom so what I did is I just go down to the bottom so I can feel the bottom and then bring it back up a bit because if you put your stick too low then the candy won't be able to grow as far as you want it to grow so that's as simple as it is and then you're gonna leave them for at least two to three days in order for any candy to grow and some of mine I left for a couple of weeks and so I'm going to be bringing those ones out to show you and I will show you how to get them out of the container after this so these rock candy growths have been growing for about two weeks and what you want to do at that point is take them off take off the little clothes cake and then the surface is hard so you just want to break it and you can do that with just a butter knife and make sure that you're not breaking it right by the stick and then you want to dump the excess out here like that and then inside you can see that the rock candy has grown around the little post here but unless you're really lucky you might have problem getting it out so what I've had success with is just holding hot water from the tap along the bottom of my container here and then gently prying it away once it gets a little bit soft so I'm going to go and do that and I'll show you the final product so I have the piece of blue rock candy out now and it's all ready to be eaten and I'm going to take the rest of mine out as well and I'll be back to show you all the finished colors so there you go everybody how to make your own homemade rock candy it was a pretty simple tutorial today but something that's really cool that you may not have done before so I hope you enjoyed it and you learn something new so thanks for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "XIKYRfZawvI": "Oh hi my name is Melissa Walker do your dance Mollie King you had to need a big cake and some salsa I finished cutting the cake here I have a bowl and I just smash the cake

I'm really excited to show you how to create a Dum Dums Garden which is a wonderful tradition and it's a great way to get outdoors and celebrate spring today I'm going to be creating an indoor Dum Dums garden which you can also do as kind of a decoration or inside and it's a nice colorful way to bring spring inside so really all you need is a couple different things which I have on my recipe card here you need a bag of dum-dums and some jelly beans and here I got this at cratenbarrel it's just a little ceramic container with some fake grass on top but really you can use whatever tin and grass you like such as this so the key here is to have some magic jelly beans but what's really important is your dum-dums because that's what creates the magic for this garden so you're gonna take your jelly beans and I like to hot glue them just to make sure they stay in so I'm going to do that today so once your jellybeans are in place you're ready to start planting your dum-dums and you want to make sure to use plenty because as soon as little ones get a glimpse of the garden they are sure to start disappearing now if you would like to create a dum-dums garden outdoors it really takes two days we're going to find a nice sunny spot outside and go out and plant your jellybeans the night before and then wait until the next morning and the dum-dums drum man will come and sprinkle some magic and a dum-dums garden will appear you", "185ikjvGAEM": "hello Alec Mike today toughest strawberry lollipops what we need first of all we need a line awakened at or a whisper non-stick baking

and a slightly cut on a smaller shirt a little bit sighs so what you have some with those take as many as you will awake lollipops then we need 1 cup of castor sugar it's about 220 gram and 1/4 cup of

range uh my last video if you guys are aware was the fantasy ice orange e-liquid which i've been smoking for the past few days now and i've got to admit i've come to like it uh something about the orange settling into my coils now it just tastes a lot more orangey but enough about that one i'll talk about this strawberry one now which i've already poured into my tf v8 baby tank um again it's on a q2 coil i put a fresh coil in and i've just juiced it up and it's been sitting for 15 minutes now so it is ready to take a nice little tug on and i'll let you know how it tastes um what i think of it and whether i'd recommend it to you guys so let's get on with baking some now you know what i've got to give it this is another nicey liquid uh straight away i can taste the strawberries and then the ice in this as well so on the inhale you get a nice taste of fresh strawberries when i say fresh strawberries it's like the strawberry you'd pick from your garden if you've ever done that so it's not too sweet and it's not too bitter yeah i think it's just right the ice in this thing is really icy so again if you don't like menthol or if you don't like the cool taste then you're not gonna like this one either but however if you're into your ice liquids this is fantastic um i'd highly recommend this one the smoke as you guys can probably see um is amazing um it's quite cloudy so it the 70vg definitely does its job so in terms of rating this liquid i'd give it a 7 out of 10. so yeah 7 out of 10 for this e-liquid if you guys are in the market um for a strawberry u-liquid highly recommend it um i don't think they're too pricey either i think a 50ml bowl um online you could possibly get for about five fifty six quid again vaporholic is where i got these ones from so if you want to give them a little look into then by all means feel free to do so i'm not being sponsored by them and i thought just let you know where i've been buying these things from um so if you want to spend your hard-earned cash uh have a little look around and then um yeah uh strawberry or fantasy ice strawberry uh definitely a nice smoke and i'll be smoking this uh for the hopefully the next few days until the next review so night night guys and take care and oh yeah i forgot to say if you guys uh like these videos please subscribe um or at least leave me a comment i don't know whether these videos are

and half a cup of corn syrup I'm just going to give this a stir and let it come to a full boil once that happens I'm going to add in 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream and then I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice now this is totally optional but it does give it a nice spice flavor and wonderful aroma you also want to add in a quarter teaspoon of salt which is going to bring out the sweetness of the caramel going to give this a stir and continue to cook until a candy thermometer or an instant-read thermometer it registers 250 degrees and this is the correct temperature to bring the caramel to so they can harden into a shell around the caramel apples but not get so hard that it turns into like caramel glass or anything like that so this is cooking and I'm using my favorite instant-read thermometer which is the thermapen I'll go ahead and link that below it's super accurate you could also use a candy thermometer clip to the side of the pot here if you prefer that too so once it reaches 250 degrees I'm going to remove it from the heat and just add in a little bit of vanilla while that cools slightly I am going to take granny smith apples and it's actually better to use organic apples because they won't have the wax coating that conventional apples tend to have and I'm just using a melon baller to scoop out little circles of apple and once I have my scoops I'm going to pierce them with a popsicle stick and I just picked up the popsicle sticks at Michaels they're super easy to find a lot of grocery stores even will have them so once all of my apples are ready you also want to make sure that you're using them you're dipping them pretty soon after so they don't Brown I'm actually going to dip them and melted semi-sweet chocolate and the reason I'm dipping them in chocolate first is not only because obviously chocolate is delicious and it's going to make these even better but the chocolate actually gives the caramel something to stick to and this is really really crucial here so I just let some of the excess chocolate flip away and then I am going to refrigerate it and so it kind of hardens into a nice shell and like I said the chocolate is absolutely critical here it's not just for flavor it has a function this is what happens a lot of the time if you don't do the chocolate the caramel has nothing to stick to okay so once the chocolate has hardened we can dip it into our caramel you want to make sure the caramel isn't so hot that you're gonna hurt yourself or melt the chocolate but it's also not so cool that it's hardened and it's not difficult so once I've dipped all of my caramel I can actually coat it in some fun toppings this is totally optional but it does make for some really pretty and cute caramel apples I have some Halloween sprinkles so they just picked up from the Halloween section at Target and I also have some chopped nuts you can do mini chocolate chips you could do other kind of candy the options are totally limitless here and you can either serve them now or refrigerate them for up to a day and then bring them back to kind of like a room temp they're not too hard and then serve them when you're ready and how cute are these they are so much fun I really hope you love this recipe as much as we did alright so these are my finished caramel chocolate apples miniaturised I really

legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

just kind of like it was spicy for a minute and then it kind of went away but fantastic flavor now like i said not my preferred flavor but it was still pretty good i was actually quite surprised so my

extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "1h-9DLb6jhw": "okay guys this one's super simple super easy for easy vodka drinks bingo we start off with a classic the screwdriver ice look at the beauty on that is handmade and I made that here okay that's another story I make a video but that's something got in the bottle you add an orange juice and then you garnish a piece of lime or piece of orange whatever you have at home super easy super cheap you could make this at 7-eleven homeboy or homegirl okay Greyhound for all you grape fruit lovers reason fresh-squeezed grapefruit look at that look at that now if it was me being as musculus I am I would have just squeezed the grape juice right into the glass okay you know I give up on ice vodka come behind that okay we strain in our grapefruit juice you don't need to strain that endo because I like the pauperis neon grapefruit juice okay I don't like it and again my car you know on the bottle but whatever all right this one right here is a Moscow Mule it again very simple we're making it a big just leaders you could see what's inside it so we add enough vodka coming out with fresh squeezed lime juice and then we hit that with some ginger bear okay she's just stirring it to mix it up she's starting out to mix it up you know just just to get a mix as you can't shake it just just to give you guys to see what it looks like but but you would pour all of that into here with crushed ice okay beautiful just pour it into a nice crushed ice and how do you crush ice put in a bag and break that bad boy up hit it hard okay go for a home run all right I'm not promoting violence I'm just saying hit not this one here is a Madras game sexy ice we come behind with some vodka followed by cranberry juice put only the cranberry juice and then you come over the top with some orange juice okay okay she stirs it up you don't need to do all that okay that's a lot of work hit it with some orange juice beautiful and that right there zoom on just coming out with a little sexy garnish and they have it for very simple vodka drinks remember boys and girls drink responsibly and definitely do not drink and drive okay we have a little taste tester in the area because all of these are beautiful I think my favorite of these would probably be the Moscow Mule followed very closely by Greyhound but hey to each his own I drink whatever mind I'm not faking stay tipsy", "9M7itso7G4s": "hey guys welcome to our youtube

to our lord they're delicious i just gotta say one thing okay thank you guys so much for watching this video have a good day and candy is out", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

you can wait before you toss it you will need sale date knowledge and common sense optional a glass of water step 1 don't let expiration dates intimidate you they are often suggestions that have more to do with quality than safety step 2 decide for the labels foods marked sell buy remain good for several days past that date used by indicates the date the item will begin to lose freshness normally food remains safe to eat a few days past then it just might not taste as good best if used by is exactly what it says use your nose and your brain if food looks smells or tastes funny throw it out step 3 you can generally drink milk for several days after the date on the carton and eat yogurt for a couple of weeks past the stamps date just be sure to keep dairy products refrigerated if left at room temperature for even a few hours they'll spoil faster step 4 enjoy eggs up to five weeks past a stamped date to maintain their freshness leave them in their carton inside the fridge instead of placing them on the refrigerator door where they will warm up every time you open it test an eggs by putting it whole into a glass of water a fresh egg will sink and lie flat on the side a bad egg will float and stay upright step 5 theoretically canned goods can stay good forever as long as the seal hasn't been broken and contrary to popular belief the food and slightly dented cans is fine as long as the can is not bulging leaking or rest step 6 the USDA recommends that you cook or freeze meat poultry and fish within two days of purchase no matter what the date on the package step 7 NOAA foods freezer life beef lamb veal pork and poultry are good for one year after freezing but ground meat should be eaten within four months lean fish is like cod and flounder lasts six months but fatty fishes like salmon should be cooked within three months lunch meats have a freezer life of two months because freezing allows food to keep almost indefinitely the recommended storage times are for quality only step 8 if you have questions about a foods expiration date call the manufacturer the number usually can be found on the products packaging did you know under federal law manufacturers are not required to stamp their foods with expiration dates", "2IA5Cv_5-g8": "the Charlie Brown and Snoopy show will return after these messages mr. turtle how many licks does it take to get to the
