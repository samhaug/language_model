{"i13c7dqLDpQ": "[Music] greetings greetings greetings and welcome back guys gather round part 2 of the history of rosin once again my name is Nikki T to my right we have Phil of soil ground solving les and over here further to the right I'm introducing you guys to Ben aka show me Terps show me the church these Instagram who navels are hard to remember this is ben mccabe show me the Terps of rosin tech and rosin techno labs what's up man thank you for having me so tell them a little bit about what you do at rosin tech so we worked for rosin tech is one of our affiliates so I work for show labs we have a distribution and manufacturing license in the state of California under our manufacturing license what I've which I directly oversee is a rosin techlabs we produce high-end live raisins ice water hashes one of our main brands is rosin techlabs so Nick mentions rosin tech rosin tech products which produces rosin presses for everything from the home user to large-scale manufacturing was a company that we started with and just through evolution through the cannabis industry we were finally able to get our California license to start putting our product onto the legal market so I head up the manufacturing and other aspects of shell labs so this guys come a long way I actually you know have watched him do all the demonstrations since day one with rosin tech products doing live pressing demonstrations and it's beautiful to see where they've come today and see this guy making moves in the license world in California they got yourself appreciate it and all the way from Barcelona Spain Barcelona Spain over here to my left we have my longtime bredrin I do ed who is a blue ice tech now blue ice tech California is working out of cookies Maywood and I do what are you doing over cookies well hello guys I'm from Spain and has telling you I'm working at cookies right now I'm trying to figure out what we can do there because they don't have a non-solvent lab they was doing just some solvent extracts but not non solvent and they had like tons of dreams sitting there on the floor just trying to figure out what to do since they realized that the solvent market is going down they thought that they have to do something with non solvent with all this trim so they called me to help them a little bit so they brought out the big guns so this is a new blue ice tech this man's been around for a long time winning multiple cannabis cups in fact last year he judged spannabis in Spain this man has been making hash this is his passion and big up edu for coming all the way out from Barcelona Spain baggage and everytime for real and I wanted each of these gentlemen on stage to kind of talk about what rosin means to them when they first learned about the term rosin when you first started pressing rosin some of the difficulties you encountered what you learned and how you learned it let's start with Ben over here you know when did you first hear about rosin uh so yeah we you know I grew up on the East Coast I'm a he's coast guy grew up in Connecticut everyone had sure like I might be the youngest person on the panel here so I might be kind of like new school right to the to the solvent less world in cannabis right as we you know cannabis years are like dog years like seven years and one really and I was making BHO just like everybody else on the East Coast and I had sent a photo to my friend I had some really nice kind of like yellow shatter that we had made which was kind of the in thing at that point and he had text me a question back I sent him this photo that was this beautiful yellow slab and he's like he's like oh is that rosin hey what the [ __ ] is rosin I was like you mean resin like what are you talking about and from there if you know we obviously started to have that discussion is where actually started to hear about Nick and you know started to dive deep into all this it was a new thing oh there's like you know we didn't have to use butane on my mother's back porch we can use just heat presses and ice water hash to get that full melt level and to actually have it be far superior than abusing in my opinion you know so to be up here on the panel is actually I mean really exciting to come that way from I mean that may mean it seems like yesterday but I want to say it was like five years ago or so when you guys were starting to blow up with putting rosin on two different social medias and youtubes and different forums you can find like little really like threads of information that if you knew like resin and knew making extracts you know things will start to pop oh [ __ ] a hair straightener you know like there was I mean the amount of hair straighteners we went through ridiculous a lot of us started with oral tradition a lot of this started with just trying it for yourself you know the hair straightener tech you know and I like to bring it back to Mila Jansen the hash Queen from pollinator when I first started learning from Mila back in the early 2000 there was nothing written about this there were a few forum posts in 2001 and really it was about oral tradition it was about going to these hash makers and talking to them about their experiences in Morocco and their experiences in Europe and their experiences in India and really just hearing what they had to say that pushed me to want to learn further I think that's still what it is even with like jar tech right now it's like a simple thing you throw it in the jar tech but like if you're a hash guy what solvent list like what you say we're trying to compete with come come back with like these butane guys making sauce it's like you put it in a jar what that's it just float it into a jar and seal it for a little bit like it's a relatively simple advancement but it's like fascinating and and really not that simple if you think about it and you mentioned you know blasting butane tubes on your backyard we all started there I feel like you know to be completely honest I did too you know a hash 2003-2004 i bought a honeybee extractor off the back of a High Times Magazine little plastic looking free butane cuz I heard it was the best butane out there and I definitely blasted butane on the back porch from my house in Boulder Colorado I'm putting it out there you know but we all started somewhere because it tated me it taught me so much it was plastic a polymer of some of some sort I don't know I'm not sure like I said honey bee extractor I'm giving them credit back at High Times magazines 2003 2004 but either way you know that's what pushed me to want to do something else I actually made that honey oil on the back of my porch and I started giving it to all my friends and my friends were getting goofy like a little too [ __ ] up you know I was like wait what's in this what are we doing here and I started actually trotting to Europe and I made trips to Amsterdam to learn from Mila in fact one of the first cafes that gave me any information as to what was that product was the Bluebird Cafe because back then in 2004-2005 is when they started kind of seeing this butane product of this honey oil hit the market started banning it in places and there were not a lot of people talking about it there was not a lot of research done Bluford cafe was one of the only places that soymilk too hot you know but you find these Henny little spots and these people willing to talk about it there was a scientist there that was doing some testing and he was finding a ton of heavy metals in there honey oil that was on the Shelf being sold so people found ways around that they started mixing the honey oil with their bubble hash you know and calling it jelly so I don't know if anybody remembers jelly from mid 2000 early 2000s but there were ways they people start around that's with morroco hash exactly but we started learning that the butane at that point there was not enough education there was not enough knowledge there were heavy metals that we were putting into the product we were concentrating those heavy metals and that's what pushed me to try and recreate that color and that consistency without the use of chemical solvents you know so there is value to what we were doing on the back porch because we were all there so I just wanted to touch on that that's where that tangent came from pick up your cell phone good yeah I actually used the the the hottest commodity was a stainless steel turkey baster and then you'd cut a screen out of the back porch like you talked about heavy metals not even thinking about it could there be holes out of my screen and I went the wrong way you know we all came from somewhere all right we all actually just consumed some of this gentleman's hash who flew all the way out here and he's utilizing dry material we all preach fresh frozen whole plant material as we were mentioning and now the man's on stage so I wanted him to talk a little bit about what he's doing in the lab specifically because we really have all preached this whole plant fresh frozen since I learned from this gentleman named Joe Petri I'm actually gonna talk about that a little bit further right now but Joe Petri kept yelling at me being like your hash isn't mine you know you're making it with butan we were posting pictures on the forums at this point getting kicked off of water hash forums because our water hash started looking like butane hash oil it was gold and gooey and people didn't believe us to be completely honest I went to the legends of hash in 2009 and I almost got kicked out this is an Amsterdam and skunk man Sam's pulls me aside he's like this isn't water hash this is butane hash oil you're not allowed in this contest is only for dry seft butane hash oil and tries to kick me and harold AKA banff extractions out of legends of hash ease so there was a lot of like trials and tribulations we faced with this new technology with controlling the variables of the ice and the water and the input material utilizing fresh frozen but to get back to joseph Pietra he was like you don't make real hash because he thought we were making butane from our photos he's like I make live hash I was like what is that what does that mean live hash and at that point I think I cut the guy off I was like I'm done with this crazy kook yelling at me on Facebook this is before Instagram and I was like but there's something to his live hash we had a messed up run in 2010 around that time when I was running a laboratory in a place called pink house blooms we had our own garden on site and at day 40 45 we started noticing some hermaphrodite plants and these plants started throwing pistols and throwing things we didn't want to see that we didn't want to bring to fruition as flowers and so the boss was like yeah just do what you want with that row we're gonna throw it away it was a little early granted but it was alive these plants were alive and I was like oh it's just kook I put this word live into my head these plants are live what are we gonna do so I literally took these plants I took a few big Leafs off of them but I chopped him at the root and I grabbed the base of these plants I put them in my cold water bucket and just started spinning with my buddy Stephen Lewis just two of us for like eight hours and we took the whole row down we're like [ __ ] oh they're throwing the [ __ ] away we're gonna just try this and we didn't this wasn't fresh frozen yet but this was live plants as far as we were concerned took him straight from the root and started mixing them and the product that came from this was amazing it started really really looking like butane at that point it was really really hard to handle and it became so hard to handle we were like okay wait let's pull it back a little bit how do we handle these live plants and that's really where fresh frozen came from or live resin in the butane world live rosin in our world there's so many different terms that we like to touch on and there's still a little time up here but fresh frozen became a commodity live whole plant fresh frozen for not only the live resin guys utilizing butane but for us solvent lists are live rosin people we were able to retain a lot more of the terpenes present in the plant while it was growing by running it live so pick up Joseph pietre if you're listening out there you know it's got love for a hater because he's the one that flipped the switch you know and that's when I started teaching Europe about processing live or fresh frozen product I feel like it's where giddy up and a lot of them got that inspiration to run their fresh frozen material in their hydrocarbon units aka live resin that's all family it all happened around the same time in Colorado but Eddie over here is doing magic so without further ado no he is utilizing dry material and I just rolled up a spliff I couldn't even handle it it's still on my hands so we want to know how you're preserving the terpenes and you know really what you've learned coming out here and experiencing some of the strains that were running compared to the strains you've ran in Europe you know give a little background about what you've been doing okay um seems all of you know I'm from Spain sorta for my bank in Spain we smoked hash for long I think since 726 year when the Arabs came to Spain they came with hash and also I think the word hashish in is coming from that because they was smoking the hash before they came to the war they were smoking hash before battle yeah hashish in that's where that term came from exactly so he's bringing it back this is his culture this is where we came from this is really what we've been mimicking this entire time is is this culture in this generation that that came from you know this man's hometown so bring it back for us so we've been smoking a hash for long and there has that we wasn't smoking it was has mostly from Morocco from Indian from Pakistan and the quality of that hash now now we know that it was low quality but on that moment was the early only type of highs able to smoke so we thought that the hash was amazing and on that time we'll learn from them from the Moroccan people that we have to smoke with tobacco's so the way we smoked in in Spain is with tobacco where all the highs with the tobacco so people in Spain they used to use like half gram of hash in a joint so they smoked four or five John's a day so two or three grams a day so people buy hash at five ten dollars a gram so now we have these amazing products that we can do as you say with fresh frozen whole plants but we all have that market in Spain ready to pay hundred bucks for a gram so that make us a little bit difficult to improve and to grow as a hash maker doing top-quality six-star pros so since the beginning I've been doing highest just with trim and that trim was trim from plants dry so we know that the quality is not like when you use fresh frozen materials because you have mortars on that because during the dry process you lose a lot of terms but that was enough good for us if we compare with the moroccan highs that we was smoking before now so that's what I do I try to do as you say magic with with trim I try to explain to the growers that they have to keep the trim fresh they have to trim when the plan is fresh and keep that that trim on the freezer for me but it's a little bit her but yeah at the beginning people was throwing away that trim I was asking them for that trim I was giving back money or hash to them so they was really happy now they realized that I'm making money with that so they charged me they charge me money for that trim so it's been a little bit hard for me to do high-quality product and be able to sell it at a fair price for me and for the customers no I think this has been an issue over generations you know in reality as I was mentioning you know I started up in Mendo in humble humble County where I was collecting trim off the side of the road it was all dry trim that the farmers didn't even want on their property because that was just more weight that they could possibly get in trouble for and it's crazy where the education has come you know we're where we started where it was just garbage previously and now we're turning it into gold and really yeah it's all about education what are your first impressions of the LA like the u.s. slash always and then kind of globally what you guys yeah so the question is uh what are your first impressions on the LA scene versus like the global scene and it's interesting that you say that it's harder for you guys to get $100 a gram I actually want to touch this real quick because in Colorado when we first brought these solvent list products to market I mean I was stoked if I was getting 40 a gram so the education and the slim amount of amazingly protected and curated material has created an increase and demand in this product along with the regulation the over-regulation and everything else that comes with the licensing in California but you know to get back to the question what is what have you noticed here in LA or in the United States as the market compared to the global market I mean I've been coming to America a few times during the last five years I used to came for the expose like high times seems like that and now that I'm here in LA I feel like it's a little bit like Barcelona in a Spain if we compare we have a Spain that we have all these cannabis clubs and all this cannabis culture and we have Barcelona that is like the center of everything now I feel like a ladies a little bit the center of everything here in America there's a lot of market here and people ready to invest and ready to spend money on the that high quality products I agree I mean especially here in the United States is what we have seen is a lot of the hype a lot of the education a lot of these products start on the coasts whether we're talking about California LA San Francisco or New York you know whether we're talking about style trends whether we're talking about trends in hashish trends in food coastal trends are real as far as what I've experienced yeah I think that that $100 a gram hundred twenty allogram that's a very la or California thing even in Colorado it seems to be much cheaper than that but I do have a question - as far as the the European market one thing you know I've traveled the spannabis a few times into Spain Barcelona like you said is the epicenter it's very much the LA of Spain in regards to weed for sure but there's a lot of hype you know over California strains right there's the gelato there's the cookies there's these newer flavors that have come out within the past ten years that people are getting excited about and even over in in Europe because California now with the legality is a lot of people who do a lot of Hardy but you rarely in California see sativa strains there's a lot of beautiful Hayes's like I'm a I'm a haze lover at heart right I grew up in the Northeast we got a lot of haze and sours which you really don't see anymore but hey is like I mean it's manageable its traditional hashish making strains nobody does it anymore partly because the flowering time but like what's your experience with washing and pressing different types of Hayes's over there do you or do strictly stick to like is the American strains the California strains the hyper in my case it may be is it a bit particular because since I love high alert if my highs is clean I like everything I like is I like in I like sativas I like indicus but yeah in Spain haze is really popular we didn't grow in and there's a hey super Silver Haze this or a strange from from Amsterdam that I I was really love of this specialist range but people don't like to grow that strength with 128 that's a rarity that's like the true Terp lover we only take him 50 60 days what are you hearing how are you yielding on him not that much you know that it was done deal that bad and they don't look really nice that they're real city where they don't do they don't do bats bro they do like small stamps you know yeah fingers it's like really special but if you are a real connoisseur you have to like City was a thing I do every time I every time I go to Spain I'm waiting to see some some different Hayes's in live rosin or full malformed I mean every time you know I hate to bring it break it to you guys but I think one of the reasons that you guys don't see a lot of it I touched on the yield but when we're talking about yield in water hash let's bring it back to the history of rosin real quick pieces have a thick waxy cuticle generally speaking super Silver Haze Jack any any of those strains uh amnesia haze what are some of the other Hayes's that are out there the blue Neville's haze there's been a few there's there have been a few outliers to this rule but most of these Hayes's that I'm seeing have a very thick waxy cuticle so even if you're gonna yield almost enough to make it viable when you make water hash when you go and then press that water hash into rosin he was talking about 91% yields we're lucky if we see 40% yields on Hayes's and that's something that even if you get a little something that might be high-quality that wax also attributes to making darker colors right you have to heat up the temperature higher to actually extrude the oils through the wax so less the color matter the less terpenes higher temperatures less terpenes you know there's a lot of variables that attribute to haze is being extremely unpopular to hash makers i feel the high i understand the haze high but when you break it down it's very high it's very hard to find a haze that's gonna be viable you know if you sell it in flower form it's extremely viable but when you break it down and you're seeing one to five percent yields after rosin it just doesn't make it viable to send into that allocated route I mentioned allocations earlier but there are some outliers and I do want to bring up an outlier it's one of my favorite Hayes's to run ghost train haze there's a few phenotypes that do combine the haze taste but with that Ghost power from the ghost OG and the train wreck to help that trichome production and we've been seeing things that are viable we are seeing 15-20 percent yields over 20 percent yields they were running one called the ghost train haze number 9 but you know no numbers at this point are dictated by the grover themselves so you can't say run the ghost train nine and you're gonna do great everyone's got a different ghost train number huh number nine but they have been able to breed Hayes's that that taste and that feeling in two strains that are viable and those are the things that I'd look for the pure Hayes's the Pure Land race Hayes's are gonna be very very hard to come by in water hash form or rosin form because of the structure of the trichome and it just not wanting to make water hash even the plan is not worth it because if you have to wait 128 130 days flowering I mean it's gonna be more expensive that with than others grow your own is what I say without one lead that haze that 100 30-day haze hi which I don't I don't discount I see that there's a lot of people that need that hi but it's gonna be really hard to find it at a shop because it takes a lot of energy and a lot of dedication yeah I don't think you'll be seeing strains like that a lot of what we do focus on let's bring it back to you know the positive side of things I actually want to hear everyone's theory on this is I've been really focusing on strains that are yielding viable amounts because it helps our cultivation see that it's it's worth it for them to give us that flower it helps our business model right so first I'm looking at that you know I don't want to be generalizing but I do look at a lot of the yield data but oftentimes that yield data also attributes to higher THC a higher THC numbers in general higher terpene amounts because if you have a thinner waxy cuticle you have higher terpenes generally which is a higher yield terpenes are heavier than waxes so there's a lot of things that we look at that yield helps us attribute to but I really look at things like the yield when we're talking about material starting material to finish product rosin I look at the potency right that's the second one and the third one is I look at that terpene representation and so those are the three things that I look for in doing my wash is if it doesn't hit those three things it's not something that I generally want but in those three things I want to have very specific terpene profiles I want to have one that's got the limonene I want to have one that has that gasps the Piney I want one that's really sugary and so I have you know my five favorite hash water hash aka rosin strains strains that do really well in water hash and do really well in rosin what are some of your guys's favorite strains I'll touch on line after what's your favorite strain to wash right now your top two been east coast I have to say ages Sour Diesel that cut specifically is like whisper my fresh frozen will yield like six percent which is which is beautiful from fresh frozen barbie Karthus of anything like I mentioned haze before like I'm a Terp seeker I don't care like really what it yields I mean at the end of the day like we all got into it because it was for what we wanted to consume so even like you know I was trying to a five haze the other day which is I could new one flowing around had the profile and it was amazing so that I'll give you three so that was that was AJ's the a5 is nice but the peanut butter cup that's been going around is I got this gas eNOS to it that I love yields well and again the Terp I mean Terps are number one for me like you go Terps are third for you Terps are number one by far makes it hard to do business fun ya know and I I I wholeheartedly love that and I love that answer but how many times are you gonna get more material from that grower you know when he sees you know if you're doing a trade you know it all depends on how you're working but say you're spending a certain amount of money on a pound of material you know and you're getting from that same farm you're getting one strain that yields that 6% that AJ that one strain that yields less than 1% it's a rarity for sure and it's not ideal every now and then you'll like run something that that yields you nothing but the end result is fire you know shall never ever wash oh yeah how long how often does it continue to come back I guess there's two sides to personally to like a business standard for sure yields always a question but gotta grow it yourself with that yeah you know because the farmers not gonna keep giving you that strain you know your boss isn't gonna keep letting you run that strangely he loses that money yeah I think you know I think as the market develops maybe they will I think that you know price will start to be dictated on the flowering cycle if it takes on takes you 120 days for some mazes to grow with that flower should we priced more right I think develops those those things might come to you know we might be able to see those things hopefully you know Phil what are some of your favorite hash strains or rosin strains okay so my favorite stuff I like to wash I definitely got to hand it to strawberry banana that's like my hello it might go to for R&D as far as like a very stable strain it's it's it's really consistent with a lot of things that I do and a lot of the experimenting I do and like it's really good for everything as far as jar tech jams you know making wet batters like the second press method solvent lists our mechanical separation like making the THC a it's very high in THC a with the greater Keane profile so definitely got a hand of straw Deana but right now one I fell in love with was cement shoes and that's just out to me I think it's just the terpene for profile that gets me as well as the just the the effects from it you know number one for me as well as I'd have to agree with then as the terpenes it's number one on my list and then next is everything else because I'm gonna do a dab after a dab after dab anyways so you know it's gonna do its job but that that terpene profile really really got me what's the cross on the cementery there's bread bite cult-classic seeds correct I'm not a hundred percent on it and with the profile man the profile is like a really gassy funky savory almost like it's unique it's that's why I like it so much because it really isn't comparable to what's popular on the market you know it's not GMO it's not papaya it's not strawberry banana it's it's none of those it's not just gassy but it's it's super unique and I'm that's one thing that I really love about it beautiful beautiful I want to talk about one of my strains in it and it does touch on some of what you guys just mentioned but one of my favorite terpene profiles for a long time has been the lemon rind terpene profile like the outside of a lemon not super Lemon Haze which has more of like a lemon orange cleaner type of a smell to me a little bit more round in fruity I really wanted like the rind of a lemon and to me what epitomized the lot of the rind of a lemon was the strain called lemon G growing up it was from Ohio it was a clone only it was really hard to get it grew like [ __ ] it grew those fingers you know you got it under a little bit too hot alight I mean really you only have Fox I really only wanted to grow it under LEDs I learned eventually but that thing foxtail like crazy the flowers weren't good my hash concentrates yielded less than 1% so I turned a whole garden into concentrates and I might have pulled like 30 grams for my head and like lost maybe $15,000 right so like I love terpenes right but I started then looking towards that lemon rind terpene and that strain called lemon tree came out right and if you guys are familiar with the lemon tree some say it was renamed from some other things you know but basically it had a very similar lemon rind terpene profile I started washing some of it maybe 1 to 3% said of less than 1% so I was like sweet a little bit higher right we got something here so I'm still hunting this lemon terpene profile this lemon rind and it was until recently that we started finding some of these lemon rind terpene profiles that were actually becoming viable you know that the farmer would give to me that we're able to run that were yielding enough so that we didn't have to turn that lemon flour into dried cured flour on the shelf and the hash maker could actually get some and so I want a big up man like Brandon third-gen family and men like Shiloh for breeding the lemon bean I know they've gone separate ways since then but they combine help to create that string called the lemon bean and we've been finding specific fee knows that have that same lemon rind terpene profile that are actually yielding so that's one of my top top strains right now is finding that terpene that actually does do the work that we need to do to keep it running through the lab what's one of your favorite strains to run right now because I smelled some fire over I did a little tour of his place earlier today and I know that they were taking down a strain that smelled ridiculous you can talk on that if you want if you want to but what's your body rating huh got a beta that Gary pains for real though but what's your favorite strange so far that you run over there at that facility or in in general because you've ran stuff in Europe before Nia yeah in Spain I've been running a lot of those widows I like that that strain it deals really good at least the the fennel that we have there and if I talk about about flavors I like GMO a lot strawberry one and I love it and that papaya that it's been popular for long now I love it bro true I love that both flavors I like a lot crazy too you know I love that I actually just recently followed the the trace of where that papaya came from because I was so intrigued by it now you guys you guys are aware that the papaya strain that's been going around its won a lot of cups have you guys seen that recently can I see the show hands if you guys seen papaya win a cup I was intrigued by this because a lot of the strains are new you know like and a lot of the strains have been around for a long time I briefly touched on lemon tree and there's a lot of people that say the lemon tree has been around for a long time I remember smelling that profile in Oregon you know back in the day but it really really got popular out of Santa Cruz but this papaya strain I think that a lot of the seeds originally were bred by Nirvana am I correct in saying that Nirvana seeds out of Europe who is who originally bred that papaya strain and then Oni seed co actually got a phyno of papaya from a facility that I help curate actually I brought those seeds from Nirvana from Amsterdam to Colorado and just recently found out that Oni Seco got that cut from my facility in Colorado and has been continuing to breed it into this couple winning strains so it's been around for a long time that stone actually came from your backyard so you know it all starts somewhere it's all in how you curate it how you hold it what you're stabilizing it with and genetics play a huge role in what we're doing out there playing with hash so I have a quick question for each of you as starting source material do you prefer indoor/outdoor do you like both I like depth to be honest with you indoors always looks great but it's a little bit of it's like Fugazi weed sometimes do you can't beat the power of the Sun like when I first started coming to California my family's had farms up north and was always like that we had this Sour Diesel that way I like an aftertaste to it that you could taste I mean for hours after you smoked but you just can't beat the flavor on light depth I mean this and then as far as price-wise from a business standpoint like it's much more expensive to grow indoor I prefer light up every time but light depth over full Sun what about if it's light depth during a time of year that you're having to use a lot of supplemental that stuff light I've made a full Sun it can be tough sometimes can be a little dirtier I just haven't had in my experience you know hash makers always good as just as only as good as your starting material right if you don't grow your own you're allowing a lot of variables into there and unfortunately I haven't I haven't had been blessed to have a super clean clean outdoor farm to produce like a like a light DEP scenario and I you know I come from when I first came to Cali and like you said I saw my family had garbage bags full of trim they were doing nothing with we were never able to get that full melt out of the outdoor but lighten up every time maybe the environmental control some of that wind barriers with yeah with the greenhouses I could always tell if your farm was next to a road sure for me I'd say I prefer indoor fresh frozen I've had a lot of experience with like outdoor fresh frozen mostly mostly fresh frozen but and I just seem to find a lot more consistency with indoor and you know a lot of it goes back to like the flower rose and days and being able to you know just take a small amount of weed and press it and and see what a yield is from there and it kind of gives you an indicator on whether you know there's a good resin content and if it's gonna even be a contender for you know washing so you know for me I really like indoor fresh version and mostly because of the consistency and variables and and also like the Terp retention without like you know depths I don't have a lot of experience with to me I think that's gonna be the next best thing as far as all around but indoor you know you don't really have much of the leaf matter and it's just more of the turps and less of the plant taste so that's really like what's big for me it's hard for me to talk about whether I prefer full Sun prefer a greenhouse depth or prefer indoor it's really about the environment and whether you can control that environment so I've actually seen full Sun grows in desert areas like Colorado that just happened to be in this crazy valley where the Sun is perfectly hitting the plants there's no wind in this valley there's no dust and dirt being picked up to hit these trees and some of the best hash that I've ever made in my life came from this full Sun Valley where it was just protected the environment was perfect the temperature was right humidity was right they didn't have a lot of wind because it was protected by this valley and we got amazing yields amazing terpene profiles you know big up Steve down there in the desert because it was like a one-man thing you know it was crazy and that was some of my favorite hash in the world that I've ever had we do see a lot more consistency in our in or operations year and year but you know it's all about environment and genetics to me you know I can't really decide whether I like Depp or outdoor or indoor more at this point it's more so controlling your environment control your genetics and me that if you can control all the details and you can grow with the Sun you don't think that the quality of the trichomes because y ou is that's why I opened up with that was my favorite girl that full Sun that was fully controlled it's a rare situation and not many farmers get that availability to have that valley where no wind's coming in they've got the perfect Sun but yet I don't know if the full Sun has been replicated yet can't beat the power people are trying every day I see a new LED mark you know LED light on the market each and every day I've seen plenty of outdoor hash that you couldn't even tell if it was indoor/outdoor beautiful sometimes with hash I mean like it's just trichomes and resin right it's about yields and the the terpene profile the flavor retention the like your conditions will allow you to get you know you guys are all touring globally so kind of talk about like different markets and what you're thinking about for the next year I have the benefit to go to a lot of places in South America which is Chile yeah I've got I got some experience in Colombia and Uruguay actually not Chile but man the cups everything competitions down there different there's some motor oil getting pressed down there in a lot of cases that people are extremely happy to have you know and it's it's interesting to see you know a lot of the technology and advancements that have happened in California going over to Europe and stuff creating these higher and ice-water hashes and live rosin is like pee it's still foreign to even freeze any product in South America you bring it down off the mountain there's no freezing anything you know so you working with what you have and it's interesting to see how far they come some of the cups down they're really interesting you get you know there's no live rosin there's none but some of the stuff they do with cured resin you know this is where it all came from what secured resin and that's what you're seeing in a lot of South American countries there's no live resins that we're so accustomed to to here that's the like the only thing I smoke is live chirping profiles I'm really excited after the show to check out some with that dried material there but that's what's really means everybody's working with cured resin and they're you know different strains to there's you know you'd be surprised what a border keeps out you know there's all you know there's a lot of strains the papaya making its way over from Europe but you know South America is is really isolated and with the legalities changing in South America and in Colombia in particular being poised to be a major player in the cannabis market I'm really curious to see the strains that they produce for outdoor and the hashes that they produce I think in a lot of senses it'll be not as superior as the States or Europe but I think that we're gonna see some really interesting things come out of there as far as mass productions and and you know solvent less cartridges and stuff which is not necessary to have extremely great terpene profiles you know it's more about the process but how much they're able to do down there is exciting and you know the u.s. never stops innovating so one of the things I wanted to touch on real quick is the the vastness and maybe it might not be the highest quality production but let's just start from the seed what I've seen happen in Morocco and in Spain in places like Valencia where a lot of the breeders are actually doing the bulk of the breeding for the United States for Europe is the seed selection is amazing they're able to pop a lot more seeds in Fino hunt to a capacity that I haven't been able to see in the United States and so that's one of the main advantages that I've seen from my travels around the world is the ability to Fino hunt on a really really specific finite level because you can pop that many more seeds in places like valensa in places like Morocco I'm excited to see the this ice water hash market in Europe as you were saying that's the only thing Europe's ever smoked is ice water hash and spliffs that'll be the hugest market for ice water hash which is my personal favorite of concentrates its most unadulterated form of trike heads or resin I think that's gonna be a huge huge product as far as live and everything as far as the market develops really excited for Europe and Spain Amsterdam we're seeing I mean we have a lot of corrosion in Spain because as I told you we have big high school tour and there's a small amount of people that they really love top-quality and they are pushing and helping us to to be able to do high quality products oh yeah and also there's a lot of people now from England that they are introducing themselves to non-solvent extracts and they have money and they are ready to pay for high quality products so for sure I think the community is gonna grow in Spain and in Europe a quick question in the traditional hash producing countries are they still doing like dry like traditional methods or they all like rocking the washing machines and that's a great question or a mix of the two and it is there is there a future for dry so the thing for us it's like it's been really hard to try to make them understand about quality because they've been doing in Morocco for example they've been doing hash for a long time okay they've been doing tons of money every season and when you go there and you explain them that they have to do it in a different way to do it more clean they've realized that at the end of the season they have 10 tonnes less than last year and they ask you who is gonna pay for these ten tons less so they don't really care about quality they care about money so of course hash from Morocco becomes more more pure right now because European people is going there to train them but it's gonna be really hard for them to change what they are doing for hundreds and hundreds of years extremely difficult but at the same time we have seen friends of ours bring freeze dryers to Morocco yeah that's true so technology is changing and they are accepting of some new technology right and some of the hash that I've seen come out of Morocco in the last two years since the freeze dry our technology is come into play they're using generators to power freeze dryers in the middle of Morocco right like this is real okay and some of the hash that I've seen is [ __ ] amazing bro we bring some of my favorite house barracks freezer freezer tracks to Morocco from Spain to do a hygiene side because we might have to stop the car I think we work at Mountain Grove nothing so yeah it's crazy that we're trying to today they've third they are fighting it we've seen the same thing in Jamaica when dabbing first became popular and I went to Jamaica you know they saw the torch and they were like nah we don't do crack man no we don't smoke out a pipe Rasta nom on my smoked spliff peer spliff well I mean you know and so the first time we brought that that technology in that culture to Jamaica they were scared you know and I think that the email and advents like that have have helped and you know really the education that we pushed have have helped as well and the same thing that we're gonna be seeing in Morocco we started showing them what we can do with a freeze dryer and what we can do with their material that they're going what strains we can bring into their growing technologies and we are starting to see some slight changes in that realm just displaying a little bit what's going on in Morocco in Morocco they have few problems the main one is that they they are growing on the same land for hundreds and hundreds of years so the land the soil is dead totally dead so they've been using chemical products to feed the plants so that the soil is dead and full of salts so the heel of the plant is really low so the quality becomes from the plan and if your plans are shitty the Hajj is going to be shitty you can clean you can use freeze-dried machines but when you grow a lamp you cannot control all these small details that we control here and as you know has is something that you're doing a small batches when you try to do big batches the quality is it's going down it's really hard to control all the small details that you have to control it that's my opinion so I hope that everything is gonna change in Morocco but it's gonna be really slow really really slow it's happening slowly all right we have to think about how you move all these highs from Morocco to Europe in all this process there's no temperature your highs it's gonna be [ __ ] up because the temperature because the time that you need to move this hash for more over to Europe so it's not that easy and Moroccan hash traditionally is a dry sip - yeah you're saying they're bringing freeze dryers there they doing I sell a lot of ice water hash and things there no moles ashes has he mentioned I'm really excited as Peter touched on as far as dry seft you know I mean ice water hash and Rosen's have come a long way for sure what we've kind of forgot about dry cept guys like Cuban are making super full melt type of dry seft which is an even more unadulterated form of resin head than even ice water hash to a sense and with like static and this different technology I think that that's gonna be from a commercial production standpoint which is like California is all about you know can we scale it is like the most popular question you get asked driveshaft is like has enormous potential yeah I'm like it III like I like I like parts of it I don't like it as much as ice water hash I don't quite think it's there I don't know what but it's exciting as far as like creating a new time although as I think we know that what it is a solvent will lose something on the water but something happened on the water process that the quality that you have at the end I feel that this bird and the dry season yeah it's cleaner for sure and I feel like a lot of this is the strains and the variables because in reality I think to get enough of the yield and to collect those heads those heads have to harden out when we're talking about dry so the heads don't have to fully have to harden when we're talking about water hash so I think we're able to retain a lot of those water soluble terpenes when we're making water hash compared to dry sift which those terpenes are falling off in the air to the environment because to enable to make to make sift you do have to harden out those heads now we've seen some some frozen sift some fresh sift but I don't know if the yields are gonna make it past that hash maker that's that's about you I've seen freeze-dried sift like freeze-dried flowers and sift and I've heard of people doing that I'm just not too sure on the yield and stuff like that this is what we wanted to get into in the history of rosin we were gonna explain what we've seen in the past and we want it's up to you guys to keep educating and keep trying these different things play with some frozen sift post some freeze dryer sift you know keep playing so you guys were mentioning the terpenes and yield are very important to you when choosing which strains to press but I was wondering also how important in terms of terpenes are the medical aspects or the medical benefits of each strain going into that and what they will be useful for in terms of when deciding what to make well a lot of this is unknown you know and a lot of this is just us playing with these different things and doing R&D because for the longest time we haven't been able to do research on paper this is still a federally illegal product that we're talking about but we actually do mention terpenes because I personally highly believe that terpenes have a huge benefit in the actual interaction how they make you feel you know I go back to the analogy of an orange when you crack an orange generally most people are gonna smile when you open an orange and that's a terpene that's present that's making you feel that specific way I think there's a lot of value in the terpenes combined with the specific cannabinoids to make you feel a certain way or help or benefit a specific effect do you guys want to touch on some of the things you guys have witnessed yeah you know THC cannabis is actually classified as like a psychedelic right and it does have psychedelic qualities and anybody who's experienced with psychedelics you're set in setting right and how you experience the power of THC is pure is is very much dictated on your mindset going into it and a little bit of some what aromatherapy and and how that strains smelled you just like you like certain foods that make you happy and certain foods don't the terpenes have a big aspect on your set and setting on creating a positive experience to start where the psychoactive components of cannabis start to affect you you're you're in a better place subconsciously almost yeah no I agree I mean I think I mean the way I look at it is THC is the the road and terpenes are the driver you know so and you know we're all not gonna feel the same off of each strain or the terpene profiles but I think it's it's like Ben was saying it really does have a lot to do with your mindset going into it you know and just you know your overall feeling you know I think it's just we're all gonna find what strains we like in the way we feel and you know it's getting to a point where with with the extraction and stuff you know we're separating the terpenes from the THC so you know now we're able to concentrate the terpene profiles and the THC profiles so you know it's definitely changing and I think that's gonna be a lot of R&D and observation with you know us trying it and figuring out you know how we like it like for me for instance you know when we remove the terpenes and you just have THCA I had fun with it you know I dabbed it I'm not a big fan of it I don't really like the way it makes me feel you know I get really high yeah but I just don't like the overall high from it you know but you know if I do a hit up THC a and then I do like a nice herpe dab maybe two and it's definitely you know it's it's way more relaxing and it's just more of a direction you know rather than an anxiety or you know just stuck in your mind thinking crap you don't want her you know I think terpenes give you a feeling you know you when you want to relax you buy things with lavender and you know like it's it's it's Terps definitely are they dictate the way we feel and I think THC just boosts us up there so a combination of all of those cannabinoids is really important one more thing to briefly touch on the medicinal aspect and why we all talk about terpenes so much is a good example is most of these strains that we're finding extremely high in CBD aka strains that are classified as hemp or drug variety hemp strains like ac/dc strains like Harlequin strains like the cherry or cherry wine and all these cherry crosses that we're seeing now in the CBD world canna tonic those strains all have a very high beta Carol awfully no file that's the terpene that's extremely present in that series of strains in all these CBD strains we're seeing now we're starting to see a fused outliers we're seeing the bubba pushes that are testing is hemp which in reality hemp is just anything that's 0.3 THC and less or less THC that's what's being classified as hemp but what we're seeing in most of these heme strains like I said there are outliers we are finding CBD and strains that don't have this terpene profile but for the longest time those strains had that cherry or that cherry cough syrup flavor which was associated with bethe Kerala flame beta care Laughlin is also the smell you're finding in anise and black pepper and some black pepper if you look in the history and what those things can do those smells those the terpenes that come from an ism black pepper are they're good for anti-inflammation the same thing that we're seeing CBD is good for so I think that there's a lot of analogies and things that we're gonna find and amazing combinations between the terpenes and their counterplay cannabinoids that do some amazing things for the medicinal aspect I was going to say I think that cherry taste is the CBD in my opinion I got to agree with that actually you know when you isolated like I played around with isolated CBT too and smoking and and just find that heavy cherry taste with it I think that's where the the name was coined 100% yeah what's that terpene I don't think there's terpenes at that point yeah it tastes like cherry that out that exhale you taste a predominant cherry I still think that it's terpenes that are left in there what else provides a flavor because I don't think a molecule is gonna have a flavor at that point but I could be wrong you know it's just what I've noticed over over generations whenever I've tried CBD when we extracted CBD from Ryan Laughlin farm in Colorado we got that same flavor and what I've been seeing in history is that flavor is associated with you know that black pepper anise type flavor the anise is very cherry like that black pepper anise beta-carotene which has been known for anti-inflammation I just think that there's going to be a lot of correlations between the terpenes and the cannabinoids and that's what we're gonna be fine-tuning as we move into the future and what rosin holds for us there's a few then out there nice but it's definitely not as exciting that's for sure we've done some awesome demonstrations that appear like we're running cannabis THC heavy strains we're washing it it's turning out to be a pure gold color we're pressing it live we did one at the endo Expo that people were like how are you guys running weed out here you know like live you know it's it's hemp however said have I think we're actually gonna be doing one together at the dabba-doo around Miami I'm doing some things out there with some hemp that looks like cannabis as I'm saying there's a lot of cush varieties coming out that are washing well it's smell amazing that smelled like your bubba kush that you're seeing at the dispensary shelf so there's things changing everyday I'm excited it's late but I to start soon I think to get specific with that question with the tens of thousands of acres of flavorful smelling hemp farm flour do you think there's gonna be a market for just like there's a market for smokeable flour some farmers are growing for those varieties some farmers are still running a bunch of seed crops trying to figure it out but I think it's definitely going towards running for specific allocations whether you're growing for smokeable varieties where they're growing for topical or they're growing for extraction purposes well also I mean talk about allocations when you have a lot of hemp farms out there you're talking a KERS and acres and acres of cannabis at the end of the day hemp is cannabis right a hard time calling it HAP it's the same thing just no THC you like Nick said but who's gonna have I mean you have 20 acres of hemp who wants to freeze all of that you know what I mean they're dried in barns and and and dried with much less care than THC is so to get high-quality solvent less at the end of the day is a little bit harder you can save part of that crop if you wanted to to make a live rosin CBD and I'm sure it would come out amazing but the amount of people doing that are very very minimal if anybody I hope to see that in the future and I think we I think we absolutely will again as the markets tend to mature we will see that but right now I don't know if anybody's doing that thanks for changing because we went from growing average of 7% CBD hemp crops when AG first certified hemp facilities in Colorado and now we're Fino selecting for putting clones out and putting seeds out of over 20 30 % CBD crops and those are going out there to produce CBD isolate which is concentrate you know and CBD distillate so I think it's definitely out there now we're seeing the smokeable varieties people pulling public push and the cush varieties coming out of Southern Oregon right now are pretty spectacular so just to bring it back like Ben said hemp is cannabis it's just testing below 0.3 percent THC people are breeding now for trichome production of CBD we're breeding for THC production since hundreds of years ago right really going after it since what the 50s or 60s that's just starting to happen now with CBD so I mean and give it five ten years we'll see some really cool stuff we almost lost CBD because people are like oh this stuff's not getting me high we're not gonna get that one you know so we almost lost it for regulation so we do have to give thanks to regulation and some over-regulation for allowing us to test all these products we literally almost lost CBD because lack of testing and lack of the ability to you know protected while testing so so I kind of have a two-part question and you kind of touched on it earlier how important are the smoking devices consumption devices to the expansion of your market and bringing new people in to enjoy these types of concentrates nude a Briggs ear IG's opening up the market to people how important is that and for each one of you do you have a device that you feel perfectly expresses the concentrate the experience for you are there devices that are inferior what is the best method for each one of you maybe I'm not the best to us to answer that question because I mixed with tobacco I've been trying to find another way to smoke without tobacco probably because that heat that comes from the tobacco I don't quit and I like that I don't smoke cigarettes I just smoke tobacco with my joints but I've been trying a lot of device and finally the only one that I like is the puff copic in my opinion it works really good I used to smoke rose in on on the Pascoe Peaks and I'm not gonna join and I think that that's my favorite I love hearing that I love hearing that you know like I mentioned one of the scariest things about promoting dabs when they first came to the industry into the community to the world was the torch you know in reality in explaining to a lot of folks we are in a different generation that this torch is for healthy purposes you know inhaling something via vaporization rather than combusting it there were a lot of things that it were really really hard to explain so I do agree with that I believe that devices like the puff coke peak and there's so many other devices coming out now the cart GPN just put out a new device there's a ton of electronic dabbing devices that are coming out to market that are a lot safer than utilizing a torch for dabbing and that are a lot easier to travel with a lot more portable much more approachable I've taken to answer your question I prefer a rig a quartz nail and a torch every time there's nothing really that you you really cannot to implicate that what I actually think one of the coolest tools and I wasn't into it at first is the turbo meter that came out to measure the actual temperature of the nail I took it dab dude a little while ago that was really like never do it without that now because you get the exact time but I think one of the most instrumental things and making dabbing more approachable I've dabbed with my grandmother on the electrical devices you know who's she's almost 80 years old she like sweet but well I only ever smoke joints and I get to tell her you know the new appreciation you know we all have for for hash and rosin now which has come I mean many you know it's come a long way let's say since her time was smoking ash but a puffs go or a Carta you know for to put that in front of her was so much more approachable and to take this generation who you know sees a torsion thinks you know really hardcore drugs that's really been the biggest revelation and leap in the industry but I don't think that as far as flavor wise and what we're searching for on extracts particularly solvent this is is it's not matched with a nail and a torch I want to touch on that real quick just because he mentioned something and you mentioned something that's it's been coming up a lot recently you mentioned that your favorite thing is a torch with a timer and for me this whole time earthing has been interesting because all nails are different all environments are different so you take that same nail in your same dag rib that you're normally torching at minute and 20 seconds but you take it outside in your backyard and that time were completely changes right minute 20 to 50 seconds right so so there's been some variables there that have confused me a little bit what you just mentioned this new device this Terp timer turbo motor it actually puts a laser on your nail itself and gives you a recoil to it laser touches a straight up coil to it to get used to have to be skilled but now there's a new one out there that's actually I think that can talk about these things because there are a lot of variables when it comes to this and you know he mentioned the puff Co peak it's all personal preference for me and judging a lot of these cups I couldn't deal with the variables of the timers I mean I took the punch because I was able to put it on a very specific temperature each and every time yeah yeah the consistency so that I was able to give an even platform to everything that I was judging was was key to me now I'm not saying that it was the best dab you know so these guys might actually have more experience with you know their favorite favorite dad but I think it can be subjective I think for judging I mean most people are probably just gonna have access to a torch and a nail you know so I think that's where most people are going to experience it you know like a peaks great I love a peak don't get me wrong like on the go I'd still rather have a torch in it you know with me but a peak is great you know for travels or things you know and it's just just convenient like Ben was saying you know to approach like my father-in-law with that you know doesn't really smoke but we're at a wedding hey he's interested it looks cool hit it boom he hits it so it's like you know the experience is that I've come across what the peak is great because of how sleek it is it takes away the whole stigma of a torch and well what are you doing smoking crack like it's it's definitely a whole better approach but I think being at home you know we all figure out our ways you know we got our glass for our beer a specific glass we got our specific rig we got our you know the time that we hit it at and and that's also gonna change there's so many variables cuz if you're doing a fad dab obviously you're gonna go in a little bit hotter you know so there's a like area will solve that but it's just being a connoisseur about it you know if you love it love it you know I love it to the fullest and I love it the way you love it I've seen I've seen your judge comes rolling hash into spliffs out of my what the hell but it's it's to experience taste like the actual resin in a bong and there they use that as their platform you know they can actually they can't taste it they just taste the weed some people need a blunt they need to back on the outside it's weird to taste the weed inside and I don't condone it you know I don't condone utilizing the tobacco but for some reason it's like that standard you know for them it might be the taste of the titanium nail or the torch maybe a little bit of the butane from the torch you know has that standard effect you know it tastes like that every time you know I'm not saying that's the reason by any means but I think it's just a subjective answer I'm loving a lot of the handheld stuff I feel like one of the first things that puff coke came out the really revolutionized things was their puff coke Plus which was the first ceramic insert portable pen that you could load your own you know it wasn't a cartridge where you had to rely on going to your dispensary to purchase that cartridge you could make your hash at your home you can make sure make your oil load it into that puff co+ I think that was a really cool referred over the really pretty cool one as well so lots of devices out there from your hash spliff to the peak to the dabber with the nail and the torch if that answers your question sir hey I was just wondering if you guys had heard of CBG of course the the mother of all cannabinoids that's what every other commie Neustadt every every cannabinoid for the most part that we see THC CBG starts as I mean CBD or THC starts as CPG and once the plant matures turns into the other cannabinoids that we value so much so where is that are you seeing that if you taken a plant down early and just seen CBG if you cut a plant early you'll still see like the ratio of THC that you have but the if you cut it early you will see extremely high levels of CBG my experience we had we cut a harvest early at a facility in Connecticut for various reasons and it had predominantly CB gene we got extremely high yields from our extraction and I was think we were seeing like 50% CBG in there but this was a like of just a almost a vegetative plant at that point so will the CBD you know as it oxidizes will it basically transform or cross over to whatever it's supposed to like for instance you know if THC a start says CB GA does CB GA at some point oxidize whether it's in concentrate for him because you know like THC a will degrade to THC and then THC degrades the CB n so like this CB g will do the same word I would assume so but we never had it around long enough to do that we've always been infused it and put it out to market into topicals I think capsules and different and different things like that from I remember some research that we were that we were into at the time CB g was supposed to be a great cannabinoid for cancer patients and stuff like that so we pushed it out in capsules and stuff like that so we didn't have the time to let it sit around or try to decarboxylate it into the cannabinoids that follow i personally don't have a nice experience with it why do you ask the question why is it three times more expensive expect more expensive than what it's three times falsified already I don't have a lot of knowledge on it so it's going for ten to fifteen thousand a liter in Oregon versus that might be some hype because in all honesty I think the reason oh you're seeing a lot of CBG stuff might possibly do be due to what Ben saying is we're seeing higher concentration of it if you pull early Organa had a huge freezing issue this year a lot of water you know and a lot of those farmers pulled early and they had to do something with that product I was seeing a lot of CBG distillate CBG kilos on the market in my forums actually just in the last three months and that might be the reason there might be trying to create a market for it I mean CBG in my opinion is easy to get I mean it's hype like who's creating CBG nobody wants CPG they want THC or CBD so CBG just because it's like what'swhat's that acronym let me get some of that you know THC V is super expensive too has a little bit more value in my opinion but CBG is I mean everywhere cut a plant early you got CPG it's easy to get but you know there's a lot there's a lot that we don't know about all of these cannabinoids their interactions with other cannabinoids their interactions with the terpenes so really you know I think that it's all gonna have to do with more testing more education freeing up the plan on a federal level to really really dig into these you know the entourage effect really the interaction of the different cannabinoids with the different terpenes I personally don't know enough about CBG and its effects alone to give an answer on that one thank you there it has anti-inflammatory properties anti-inflammatory properties yeah okay okay anyone have a comment over there what about the like whistler tech kind of closed systems that they're coming out for bubble hashing i do i was i was gonna ask you about this to other kind of projects along those lines and what that might do to just like the production of hash maker i think that we cannot be run in a lab that we have equipment really expensive and be using plastic bubble machines so since I found that that company's creating a big machine stainless steel with high grade medical grade everything proper I thought that that was the Machine I had to say that the price is two hundred fifty thousand that is important to know nobody kind of for there's quarter million dollars exactly oh and I know that part Eddie was actually gone and visited the facility right yeah you've gone and seen the machine yeah what'd you guys get to wash there how was the we do it in a random facility that they just bought the machine because the wizard company if they don't have a way to show you how the machine works if they don't buy width so they don't buy width they do machine so every time that they sell one machine they use that client to show to other clients how the machine works on that facility the people working on the lab they was just people from lab not from hashas world you know so they don't know they don't know nothing about how they was just running fresh frozen plants but I don't know why the quality became really low so I'm not really sure if that machine is it's been created to do formal hash it's been created to do massive production probably with have always always weighed but not to do like formal it's not for that so I love the question though and it's something that a lot of us have been working on for a long time there are a few units out there that are 100% stainless steel and there's been other companies discussing it the I I do see a lot of value in the fully closed loop version you know having stainless steel as your agitation but I still to this day have not seen anybody bring it to fruition and have the agitation coupled with the separation in one unit you know bubble bags ice water extraction bags essential bags ice extract bags bolt bags you name it the pollinator bags you know these bags have been around for a long time and it's what we use coupled with whatever agitation we're using whether we use in hand agitation with wooden doors or paddles whether we're utilizing a washing machine I said it was mentioning these plastic washing machines that have been used in our little space and industry for the last 10 years or whether using one of the brand new Brutus stainless steel barrels from pure penetration there is a huge need right now to couple that agitation whatever it may be whether it's magnetic or electronic or mechanical agitation with separation because in reality when we first went to states like Nevada and talk to them about water extraction bags they were not for it the health department didn't like it there were a lot of nose that came with reusing nylon bags over and over again so as we move forward there is a huge need for some type of closed-loop unit I for one have been working on a unit I've got five seven prototypes at this point still haven't found the exact thing that I'm looking for I'm flying up next week to a place that we're working on but I hope to be another final one but I think a lot of us are working on it Ben looks like he's itching to talk about his newest product coming out of rosin tech products but you know there's a lot of people working on this and to be honest whoever comes out with it first I'm gonna support me to like say for sure I'm excited for it things that I think all of us are like drooling to get you know agitation is one thing collection is total something totally different I think with Whistler tech and a lot of the other machines I've seen or trying to utilize the stainless steel mesh is utilizing a totally straight flat stainless steel and to collect the trichomes off that it's not as easy as like a bag a bag is easy to to put a spoon in there and scoop it out nice and generally and not disturb those heads where if you try to collect it from a straight up stainless steel flat screen you're just pushing smashing heads these things that we've done delicate harvest with to put all this energy to grow and they're just smashing them against the stainless steel screen is quite an issue so I mean not that we you know have anything to announce but you know it's I'm excited to see you know and I don't know where you have been playing with a lot of people trying for these columns that the shaker columns you know they're used to separate paint or used to separate different settlement types and sizes these shaker columns for years for dry sift but Eddie you mentioned that you know even with those units we've seen a lot more raw or crude end products that then have to be cleaned further so there is value to getting a lot of a crude product and then cleaning further down the line and I think we're all going towards that same goal of finding a closed loop unit that doesn't just produce crude but produce the craft that we're looking for I think there's always gonna be there's always gonna be a market for handmade ash and I really don't think that handmade hashes is going anywhere I think that even with these developments of larger machines whether it be even the marketing of handmade hash it's always gonna be slightly higher quality I think how can you get I made handmade hash that smelled like mildew and was black and pliable that about commander casinos so you know there is value to changing up what we've known from the past and you know being open to what's coming in the future for sure I think I think the Whistler tech I mean the closed-loop systems are gonna be great for rosin extraction for sure I mean especially if we're going for like full-spectrum and you know I think it's gonna take a lot of us getting in there really testing these machines and and tweaking them and putting our little techniques and really understanding what it's doing and what we can do to change it and adjust it you know like any machines just a base you know but then you start putting the people who don't know what to tweak and what to add you know add this do this my feeling when I was there it was that that they are just people that they they do machines they don't do hash so there's few points that they do they don't understand how they have to do it because they don't do hash so they need people like us going there and telling them a that machine is good but you have to change these and that or I need these or that on your machine so we have to like do it together there's there's a lot of chemistry going into it whereas chemistry and hash making are two different things in my opinion were separating heads were mechanically separating oil and a lot of people developing these products are from a chemistry background was a science background that is extremely valuable but doesn't always translate it's really hard to say that there's a science to extraction because in reality you make a rosin press for example where you can create you know a certain pressure for a certain amount of time at a certain temperature and right and you call it Sour Diesel so right you you think that you're coming into your lab and you're like okay perfect I got a bunch of Sour Diesel I'm gonna press the button that says Sour Diesel and everything's gonna be good because it's all programmed for the Sour Diesel temperature and pressure and everything else but not all Sour Diesel is the same you know and not all rounds of Sour Diesel the same maybe it's the same phenotype from the same grow but this round it was you know that he had too much magnesium or too much fossil load or something he added to that round and the pressure and the temperature changes up so it's really really hard to just say that you know you're gonna press one button and you're gonna be good to go cannabis is a different plant and it has a lot of variables associated with it I think I think it really matters I think we can all agree that us up here I have a true passion for it I think that part of what makes like a hash maker or somebody is is to be able to define what is a good product what is the real Sour Diesel cut what is you know a good development of that cut you know what I mean there's different hues different levels to the terpenes that you can hit and a little bit comes with the with experience and knowing what a good cannabis product is or hash or a good strain a good profile definitely definitely I agree for sure I've been doing highs for a long time and I've been losing money a lot bro just trying to find the best product so if you have passion on doing high as you are not doing hydro wrong we're all consumers first right like the passion is what keeps us dedicated and pushing forward in innovation and it's what so why we've evolved so quickly as Saul says you know all of us on stage want to smoke I actually I actually loved hearing Nick you and Phil talk about the origins of hash you know I still I still nerd out on that on that stuff where you don't get to you don't forget to hear to guys like Phillip Nick you know talk about you know putting it to an email you know and doing a five times that's you know that's cool stuff and I think that you know a lot of us really appreciate and nerd out on those types of stories the old genetic stories and the beef in the cannabis industry is like it's the juice this is real oral tradition this is what happened now a lot of this is written down but we're gonna tell it to you straight here today give thanks for coming out

straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well

it off how beautiful it is this is my ambassador version so i just got it in they were nice enough to ship that out david came out here to be able to unpackage it with me take a check look and i am getting ready to do a nice big squish on it so i'm gonna really break her in and have a uh see how well it does on i don't know squishy here so we're live we we're doing good here all right so let me get this set up exactly how i want to go i'm going to do four bags of 15 grams three bags on the bottom plate all right so i'm getting this set up here basically i'm using this so that we can get a good look at the flow coming out let's give this a little pressure here [Music] and i have two more 15 gram bags we're gonna do on the top level this is what i love about this press not all the time do i get a lot of product that i can push through but when i have multiple runs on the same product it really is nice to be able to get it through here all right that should look just about right just want to make sure these are in there good i don't want to have any problems okay now the fun begins okay paper set up like i want all about the prep work make sure you got everything placed right where you want it looking good all right got each one of these bags here with a directional flow so that's basically going to push everything out the front here on the front i've got these bags that are made just a little bit longer which will give them room to drip over what i love about this press is it gives me the ability to change the direction so i can tilt this at any angle i want to be able to get that rosin to flow off those plates a little bit faster when i'm doing a lot you know i can what i'm doing over i can just turn it all the way 90 degrees have it run straight out but this makes it a little bit easier for collecting and i feel like getting air mixed in with it is is kind of a little down from what i'm opposite what i'm trying to do actually so here we go start taking a look here oh that's so pretty but i like it still one bag that's still kind of everything's looking good though they're all holding pressure's just about right there we go that there is beautiful girl scout cookies ice water hash fresh frozen whole plant a few more farms here in tulsa grit beautiful that that looks a lot better than i thought it was going to that uh it's gorgeous i'm pressing that 180 on this i've been kind of changing all over the place on temperatures uh i'd like i like getting it off the plates as quick as possible you know i just don't want to have any reason for it to sit on there any longer going slower temperature wise lower temperature wise and i found this really is the best trade-offs on all sides because you're always going to give up something for something else speed temperature that's artwork right there we just need to put that up on the wall talk about expensive artwork bringing it up probably close to about three three thousand right now two thousand tons of psi i feel the bags are pretty much have given me all about all of it just want to make sure with having this many bags on there you kind of go the extra mile because some are just a little different definitely don't want to leave any i have to get this weight up see how many grams we really got off of here so the biggest thing about this is that i'm an ambassador now for triminator here in oklahoma so if you want to check out this press if you have one of these presses anything interested in it give me a call hit me up on instagram 9180g underscore and i'll be glad more than happy to show you answer any questions kind of just give you an idea in education we're going to be doing educational videos with terminator doing on the rosin education series and we'll have some really good information on there people just you know trying to get basic information not too overwhelming but also have some really good details for people that already know what they're doing just little tricks of the trade all right i really feel like that's about all i can get out of her fighting back on all the bags okay sorry i'm kind of concentrating on getting these out of here without making any mistakes and i didn't i don't know if the lighting in here will do it justice oh you can see all those terps in there beautiful the smell let's take a look at one of these bags on the bottom row that'd be the one with the least amount of power let's see how she looks so all you want to do one one good indicator of how well you did is to take a look at the bag through the light and how clear it is gives you a really good idea that you've got all of the product out of there you can see just pushed it out to the edges and that's going to be all your other material that you didn't want out of there anyways so very pleased let's look at that let's look at one on the top shelf and just see how they did comparatively all right taking a look at the same thing very similar they look pretty much identical this one has a little bit bigger that looks really good that's one thing about this product is just the hand pump everything about it being able to really feel the uh the pressure that i'm getting back and where i am in that bag so bva throw it out to them like great pump and the primary man you just can't beat it so let me know you guys want to check them out again i'm the ambassador here in oklahoma and um looking forward to putting out a lot of good uh educational videos and different types of", "OtRdhFVqP5k": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

checking out some punch-drunk live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm we have a map on there you know few of our local stores you know throughout the Denver metro area you know pig and whistle Northern Lights you know star bud so check the website the website you know pretty much a good majority of Colorado stores and make sure to follow these guys on Instagram they got great content its cush dot masters is that right yep awesome very final thing for we wrap up our show here for the day the award that you won that was with the rooster right yeah is the rooster they have two competitions that they do for twenty and seven time yep the two kind of holidays of our industry and 710 being oil spelled backwards and 420 I mean who knows the real jet that came up but you know it's it's cool to see them embrace the industry and actually the companies within that industry it's really awesome to be able to do recognized for your hard work I feel like that is just unanimous in other industries that's the land here it brings a lot of legitimacy to the table check out coach masters if you're in Colorado they you can get tickets to the rooster events when they come around so make sure to give them a shout out they're really fun last one we went to a temple nightclub down in Denver we all had a great time so thanks for coming on the show thank you all right thanks for tuning in guys that was some really great product so to get more solvent list reviews make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel right here below check out the rest of the episodes and all of our great solving this videos thanks for tuning in yeah [Music]", "9FFnQhc2sgk": "hello and welcome to today's webinar solvent list extraction explained profiting from rosin my name is Eric sandy and the digital editor of cannabis business times in this exclusive webinar pure pressures director of marketing Eric glass key will give you the tools strategies and key information on how to capitalize on the quickly growing solvent extraction segments of the cannabis market focus on actionable insights this webinar will cover solvent list concentrates across every aspect Eric will explain exactly what saltless concentrates are which eske use are the most popular how to cultivate or source material that yields well for Robins and how to attract customers to your brand just a few quick housekeeping notes before we begin you'll notice on your screening questions box please do feel free to type in your questions as the presentation is going on and I will relay them to Eric at the end and also know that if you have to leave any time we will be recording this presentation both the audio and video and emailing the full archive link to all registrants in a few days here so you will have access to to the whole presentation with that I'm very pleased to welcome today's presenter Eric Blackie thank you Eric appreciate the time in the intro and I also appreciate everyone who's tuned in right now this presentation was designed with you guys in mind and it's going to be really focused on educating everyone about what solvent list is and how you can incorporate it into your business profitably so to get started just going to do a quick intro here and go over what our agenda is so everyone gets an idea of what the cadence just like Eric just said my name also Eric I'm the director of marketing and now business development with peer pressure I joined in 2016 and I'm also the marketing and brand strategist for peer Cannell abs which is our sister consulting agency I've been working in the cannabis industry for just about there is now big passion for what's going on it's awesome to see the growth in the industry so today's agenda first I'm going to be talking about what is solvent list we're going to be going through kind of the layman's overview of solving Wisconsin traits and all concentrates just as they fit into the market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you and have a fantastic day", "-zzGD_SOGVA": "if there was one thing I think I wish the new patients knew when they first walked into the shop it was probably just that all the information that they got online it's not necessarily always relatable to you one thing I wish first-time patients would know is that they can't touch the flower you can't touch the bud it's like a strip joint you can look but don't touch people come in first thing I'll tell them hey you can smell it you can take a look please don't touch it the first thing to do is touch it like okay let me touch it like a kid no no touching honey they want to smell every single jar but then they know what they're gonna get already and I'm fine with that it's just when there's a line it's like you know what you're gonna get over it it just you know they sometimes get very upset because of the taxes right now there's a heck of a lot of tax and your price is gonna change I wish they knew coming in that your lungs and your liver process THC differently so just because you're an OG smoker and you can smoke the heavy stuff of today doesn't mean you can handle 100 milligram edible when you get a bottle of xanax and it says 10 milligrams a pill it's 10 milligrams of pill and it's kind of like the same way with an edible it's always best to start less you start with 5 like the rest of us and figure it out let's not risk it and have you call the hospital thinking that you're dying I wish they knew that it's okay to ask things and not just assume because a lot of times people will come in first time and they act like they know everything we'll know like I read this or like oh like my friend told me this and it's like just keep your mind open you know go in there and try some stuff out I don't know just give me the best strain okay so are you in the mood for creativity are you in the mood for relaxing your body it's not gonna kill you try it a little bit see how it does bring it back if you don't like it we'll give you something else it's medicinal now you're not coming here just to get hot it's a medicine that's what it's there for first and foremost is to provide relief there's so many questions about CBD and it's so beneficial I wish the general populace knew that for a lot of people it takes seeing it to believe it a family member of mine who is never consumed or smoked weed in their lives now uses CBD to sleep and this is someone who still would never smoke weed but is now fully understanding the in the benefits of this plan", "59wx-UVVMPA": "[Music] [Music] well one more time we are glad to be able to come to you to facebook via zoom and we have as our guest one more time our pastor veronica otterbridge and we are dealing with a topic that is i almost want to call it precious and the reason i want to call it precious is because it's about our future it's about the future of bermuda and we're dealing with that topic of weed and we're saying that our borders have been compromised and when you compromise the borders of bermuda you're going to impact on the community the neighborhood every family every family you know and and just as a little preface to this conversation lots of people talking about the videos going around and people fighting well just just keep adding some weed and the rest of it see if it gets any better uh we've got a ways to go in the island of bermuda nevertheless as a good pastor as two good pastors we're going to pray and then i'm going to formally introduce uh pastor otto bridge let's pray father god again we thank you god we thank you for your plan your plan that is perfect it was perfect before in the beginning and it's already completed perfectly and god we ask that during this time of chronos this time right here that you will perfect our steps god what we discuss what we share with the people god that it is indeed ordered of you now father we pray that for every listener that you will enable them to not only hear with their heir but here with their heart hear the heart of the matter i pray that you will indeed bless bermuda because we're dealing with situations and not just hiding them sweeping it under the carpet i pray that you'll give our pastor otterbridge divine and just holy ghost field wisdom in how she shares all of the information the knowledge the knowledge base that she has we thank you for her she is a gift to the body indeed for such a time as this bless her keep us covered god in the precious blood of your son jesus and god at the end of this you will be glorified in jesus name we pray amen amen so as as you heard we have our pastor veronica otto bridge a fireball of bermuda that's what we're gonna call her tonight a fireball of information and that fire is the fire of the holy spirit and you know what god made sure that she had certain knowledge you know nurse the bible such a time is this nurse about marijuana the weird issue nurse about it as a substance and they are nursed through counseling people families that have been impacted by this drug and so we're bringing a real live person who can speak from three aspects of it the knowledge base the counseling base and the christian base and i believe that this is the reason this is the reason why she is the ideal guest and hopefully informing multitudes here on facebook and then it's going to be on youtube on swim tv about what's going on and why we should be concerned why should we be concerned that bermuda has tabled legislation to legalize a drug called weed and so tonight god bless you pastor otterbridge i thank you for bringing your wealth of knowledge and your passion uh to the forefront and it helping us to understand in the totality of things what's going on last time we we talked a lot about uh the weeds some of the symptoms what's happening yet we had more questions and you read those questions and so listen i greet you in the name of jesus and i give you the platform teach us pastor talk to us and tell us what's going on what's happening and why we need to be concerned welcome one more time and thank you uh pastor seaman for having me one more time and uh certainly uh i believe that god will be pleased with us and that we would do what uh god would have us to do and the thing that comes to mind right now is run down to caesar the things that are ceases but what belongs to the lord we give it to him and uh i'm not muzzled by anybody i'm retired and closer to 70 than anything and so nobody can uh fire me and neither do they hire me but we get our calling from the most high god and i am able to speak because we've seen the effects of this drug on people's lives and therefore as we said on last week we do applaud our government for uh all that they've done in trying to guide us through this pandemic however uh i do believe that in the mid sometimes of doing good uh evil can raise its head and so we said you know we asked the question why would anyone in the midst of a pandemic try to push legislation through you know when the people are just you know they're tired because of the virus and and here is the government who are supposed to be intelligent people trying to push a legislation through that needs the people's undivided attention so i believe that it was a strategic move but it was a wrong move and i will say that boldly it's a wrong move and should this government go to any further to legalize and cultivate then it will go down in history that this government were responsible for the lives and the minds of young people in this island and it will go towards the record we have not heard anything from the opposition but then again probably they have their reasons as well because if it's money to be made and that's all they see and they see money over people then we have a problem bermuda he do and i rest assured even if i'm not on this earth heaven will not be pleased with what's going to come down the pipes with this we want to save our generation our young people and so first you save their minds yes we're not going back into slavery and bondage maybe we couldn't talk to the masters of the olden days cannot talk the drug talks to us the drug tells us go get me what you've been giving me and so that's what we're dealing with tonight and certainly i've looked at some of your questions that you've given i thank you for all of your applause and the people who reached out as i moved throughout the city now praise the lord but um as i said i have some murders in mind and that is to rescue our young people nothing else not to get no glory or anything but when you step on the passion of my training then i step to the forefront because i'm called like you're called to speak to powers amen maybe some people are afraid to speak to powers but i don't have a problem with that that's it because when god hates something then i hate it and i know this is one of the things that our father would hate but we look tonight to try to go over some of the things that we had shared on last week so that our minds could just slow down a little bit and i know i said a lot last week and so we're going to uh try to go over but then again add to some of the things that we uh shared on last week and so i'm going to just get my sharing screen so that we might be able to share with you some of the things that we had on last week and we talked about cannabis as it relates to uh what it is but most of our training and all of our research comes from nida it is the national institute of drug abuse uh in america they are the researchers and they are the agency supporting scientific research on drug use and its consequences so even if our government wanted uh to get research at its best uh they needed to turn to nida and i'm sure that the uh department of now drug commission national drug whatever it is in bermuda uh i don't keep up nowadays unless it affects the people uh follow their research from nida and also samsha f-a-m-s-h-a which is the substance abuse and mental health services administration and because it deals with uh mental issues uh when drugs are taken uh these are the experts in the field so any clinician a substance abuse counselor uh would go to neither to find out what is the latest research and so uh for anybody that's watching today if you don't understand you can google it uh nita and samsha and see some of the research they've done up to today and why this drug is not always considered to be a safe drug for anybody whether it's recreational medicinal research has improved in that it's all that in medicine but if a person who is sick has shown to have results then certainly and so i want to say up front and i want to say it very clearly that i am not against medicinal marijuana neither am i against sponging records in the island of bermuda what i did say on last week was that um if the government of of this island wanted to really do something for those who are on the stop list then why not do a dialogue with america so that not only is the record as sponged in the island of bermuda but that bermudians are able to travel because as of this point even with all the sponging of the records we we'll find out that that does not uh basically uh go far enough to address that bermudians still cannot travel but then again if you put this drug in their their midst then there are a lot of other things that uh possibly uh questions are unanswered as to driving a bus and so on or will they be drug tested so i recognize that it has not been uh probably thought through because the right people have not come to the table as it relates to getting the right uh consensus about this drug and uh last week you talked about principles and teachers and certainly they should have been to the table and being a professor myself uh you know we know that people come before us who we are suspect have used drugs and i know enough about the drug to know when somebody has been using and like a lot of teachers and you yourself as an educator have probably seen them coming uh before you as you said a little bit yeah and so those are the things these are the people that should have been to the table certainly the bermuda drug court judges should have been to the table and if they were to the table then did the government listen because there is enough to basically uh give us a consensus that it's not something that we want to pursue i see that the legislation has been tabled as relates to a sponging of the records of individuals and that's that's fine but please bermuda government don't go any further and talk about uh cultivating this making yourselves legal drug pushers in the island please do not do that because you are moving down the wrong road if you become the drug pusher in this island you could call it regulated you could call it legalized at the end of the day you're making profits off of people and so let's put it up amazing we talk about uh marijuana and we said on last week it's the botanical name of marijuana and it's cannabis sativa and this is the greenish grayish mixture of the dry flowers of the cannabis sativa which comes from the marijuana plant and of course we said that it has many street names and we didn't get into all of them but of course marijuana has many names such as pot reed joint blanche cannabis reefer mary jane that's what i call it because you know she takes control over most people uh bugs stink weed grass for training ganja dope herb tobacco hay rope kemp blaze block boo charge and birth and this is of course it's not an all-inclusive list because the names are ever-changing as it relates to this specific drug however we do get the names of marijuana and culture uh for example we said on last week that in south africa which i traveled to quite often uh it's dagger and in north the north african moroccans called the drug chief o'keefe uh in jamaica of course it's called ganja and the spanish term is mota and in hawaii the name for marijuana is pacalola and so marijuana also has names that is based on the culture of the country and its origin so you talk about apollo you talk about the acapella gold and and that's a strain of cannabis sativa that is popular was popular during the 1960s and the counter uh of movement for its potency and the unique color of the acapella gold and then there was the thai stick of course this comes from thailand now and it was grown on the hills of the northeastern part of thailand and and it was it was some of the highest quality uh marijuana found in the 1970s so if you had any type of debt you had some stuff probably just mess with your neurological system so that you started shaking because it does mess with the nervous system in many instances uh there was one called colombia rare as well way back in the 70s and the 80s and then is the panama gold and the texas tea the maui the mexican the black russian the colombo and these are the names of these drugs in their culture and their countries and so it's a lot involved in learning about this and research and during the years and as i said my my best uh experience and learning was with my clients and one thing about a person who is addicted when when something hits and identifies with what they're doing they are the most honest people in the world the the dishonest people are the people that are looking on and trying to be in denial and we're not talking about the riven island africa we're talking about denial that denies the very fact that something is going on with them and so we've had clients look at another person who has talked about the experience and and start to cry because they say you know oh my gosh that's me you know of course i have to ask why are you crying if you came into the group saying that you were not addicted now why are you crying because many times we see ourselves in the lives of somebody else who is addicted especially when you don't realize or admit that you are addicted right and then is the cannabis also that we talked about the psychoactive ingredient uh and that is the mind-altering element and we said that anything that has to do with the mind specifically drugs and their effect on the mind is regarded as psychoactive and that's what marijuana is a psychoactive ingredient which causes an altering of the mind and how the person feels and that uh ingredient is called as we said last week and don't be afraid of this big word but that's what we get for the thc and it's delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol and we could see how we got thc in there and the main psychoactive mind-altering chemical in marijuana is this so for people who who talk about you know they felt a certain way or you know a little high or worsen a lot of this is to do with uh this delta nine this thc level and it's found also and produced by the leaves and the buds primarily the female cannabis plant there's a stronger form of marijuana that it's included called cincimilia and specifically it is tended from the female plants and is concentrated resin containing high doses of marijuana which is the active ingredient and we get hash oil we get rexy we get butter we had uh amber shatter and these resins are increasingly popular among those who use them for recreation and for medicinal purposes so the plant also contains about 500 uh different ingredients i saw where somebody was talking about that one and they say well we don't use all that stuff that they put in it no it's in the sea and that's how uneducated people are they they talk oh well it's a lot of preparation yeah it is to get it really is but the chemicals are already in the scene so when you talk about embalming fluid and embalming it's certainly the undertakers you know they get you if you're not there time they put that embalming fluid in you you are dead i know and so if there is an element of the embalming fluid that comes into uh one of the ingredients of cannabis then you're gonna have a sedated effect you may not die but that's why you feel sedated or calm down mixed into it you know trying to prepare it and so the thc level when people say about uh it's low or high this is based on that thc again the soil is important the condition the weather and also the time that is harvested and the strength that's the potency of the marijuana but one thing is for sure and nobody can deny it marijuana does affect people if not they wouldn't be using it right so it does a fact yeah and for whatever reason you know people take it whether it's to get high or make you feel good or increase your sex drive or whatever you have in your head she's in your head marissa and after a while she takes control of this because once she gets in the transmitters and the there's we'll talk about that a little later but some people smoke marijuana in hand road um you know the riesler joints and the pipes and the water pipes i remember i did a workshop for a conference in bermuda and uh it was at the seat of the annual conference of the amy churches at that time and we were speaking on crack and and so i took some of the crack pipes in there you know that they had used and whatnot as uh instruments and um one of the seniors after i finished the presentation i had some of my clients who were on the panel and they talked to the issue of the crack pipes and the marijuana of course we had it all was full of stuff and she said you know what my tenant has first in his bathroom window they're lined all up i say yeah those are crack pipes but when we don't know we don't know and you should find out but i'll tell you one thing if it looks like a duck cracks like a duck it probably is a dog so marijuana is also rolled in uh cigarette reps and marijuana can be used to brew tea which some people do they brew tea and that's why they think it's okay or they put it in brownies they put it in biscuits and cookies and candies and now vaporizers are also on the increase used to consume marijuana so they're vaping so the more potent marijuana now will of course increase the physical and the mental effects in the individual using which varies from person to person and as we had said uh depending on the makeup of the drug and it's cultivation it's time but also the body chemistry of the individual so when a person says that's don't do me like that and that don't do me like that half the time what's so brand damn to the drug we don't we don't have no more facts my mind because we are we have reached our level of tolerance and so then some people say well they're going for another high so then marijuana does become the gateway drug but i want a little bit more something so again if somebody says let's just lace it a little bit put a little bit of you know crack cocaine on it or put a little bit of um you know hair and you know just lace it up a bit make it more exciting very deep there's no such thing about a weak mind because the person that thought that the next person was a weak mind when they took it they end up in the same predicament addicted and they say the mind is a terrible thing to raise so why would you put something in it that you're not sure about and be used based on a lot of factors a harm environment we use because our friends use for whatever reason you don't want to go there and as i said if marijuana has a sign on her she'll probably say use me at your own risk and i guarantee you maui doesn't have a lot of them down there with psychosis because they knew how to handle it wow wow so pastor let me jump in here and just say it sounds to me like there's a lot of escapism in people not being able to deal with their in reality and wanting to make life more exciting or forget what they're going through take a break yet what's key is this compound you don't know the extremities that are in it and how it will coincide work with and against your own individual biological makeup so no it doesn't respond to everyone the same mary mary's different absolutely and again why would you continue to use something that has negative effects but the thing is is denial is the blocker here because you know i like the way it makes me feel but then again i can't explain my irritability or for the child who was a a student and now his song to a c or he's failing and i could understand it with the young the adolescents but with the adults and sometimes marijuana is no fool like an old one hmm because when you're in denial to something you have to abuse it too and that's what happens but we don't realize that you know we're not the one that's abusive she's abusing you right because when you first used it you were in control now you can control because you need her and she's telling you go get me what you've been getting me all this time if not i'm gonna make you irritable based on here so rather unbeneficial or not or health problems or instability to perform even sexually because it's known to affect sexual organs and many who use it would not readily admit that right however if you were to discuss it with a female partner there are many times dissatisfaction is expressed in that area but again it becomes personal you see but then again i have clients and they'll be ready to admit it because you know it is true then they want to get better so the partner may just suffer inside and say well you know it's my spouse or whatever you know that's my bow and i believe them you know but they get mad when they're in bed uh-huh so so so really the substance has become the other woman well that's right in all of them you know so even when you know why i say you know i think my husband is being unfaithful and uh you know and i've got them and i said no they're not being all faithful they just have miss coke mercy that's the other woman miss coke wow and so we have to recognize that these girls all of these girls and and don't leave out the alcohol don't leave her out that's right the most legal one and she'll take down people before all of these other ones because she affects every organ in the body alcohol she gets at your liver and without a liver because everything metabolizes in the liver you're gone that's right you've got a bleeding liver and they can't get it to stop because alcohol has done our thing but then again let's get to mary jane yeah she's got her makeup too so when we talk about the sexual organs now in some cases and these are cases that are on neither so even if you go and you look at it you'll find the cases that are there that um though uh many people talk about marijuana and sexual performance and deny it marijuana many times delays ejaculation when it comes to having sex and in 2010 the survey of 8 656 australian adults this in the journal of sexual medicine men who had used cannabis daily more likely to report reaching orgasm too slowly or not at all compared to those who never use but that the study also found that calabash use was associated with premature ejaculation as a reminder this is a self-reported study so the men give an account they're not afraid to tell you what's happening with them but we could be in denial all we want we cannot deny facts and there are some uh evidence to in humans to suggest that frequent use of cannabis can cause undesirable effects for instance among chronic heavy cannabis users the drug can negatively affect sperm production this is dr early wine and again you could find this uh one nita and in a study published in 2015 in the american journal of epidemiology researchers looked at the semen quantity of about 1200 men didn't matter if they came from the moon or not the research showed that those who use cannabis frequently more than once a week hello 20 my god reduction in sperm concentration and a 29 lower sperm count compared to those who use once a week or less let me interject the thought here if it's impacting the sperm concentration as a scientist that's got me thinking then that when the sperm even reaches the egg that child is not going to be born like the normal child is born that's where you can have some children that are born addictive fidgety won't sleep talk a bit about that now we're gonna come down to that about okay uh the screams and the cries of babies who are positive because what they're screaming for is what they were given down to the many times and and so the research is ongoing with this because it is a sensitive issue that people don't want to admit and many of our children who are adhd and what do they give them retalin which is highly addictive another substance and so most likely these children then end up you know being on some sort of drug too and they're quick to put them on ritalin rather than to try to find out exactly what's going on with the child so we see then the effects of marijuana once it's inhaled uh the user may experience a increase in heart rate or the dryness of the mouth the eyes reading and we've seen that we should you know they come into the house and parents are saying why are your eyes all red my eyes are not real now the only one that does doesn't know that the eyes are red it's like a monkey and he climbs up right and it's just the grin and grin and grinning and he's the only one that doesn't know he's sharing his tail so the higher the monkey climb the more he shows his tail but he's around giggly giggling giggling there but it's laughing because he's climbing high thinking he's okay so all the things there come out and also the inability to be able to perform small tasks which which require concentration and quick reaction so can you imagine driving a bus in front of people and somebody comes at you and you have to swerve but because of your delay oh because you had your joint in the morning to function you cannot pull the boss over of course the person can get the blame but you know that quick reaction that is needed can prevent an accident because the drug is a sedative drug and nobody's going to change that at the end of the day you're going down your gun down you could call it mellow you could call it cool you could call it relax you could call it you know that you know what peaceful you know and all of that that's mary jane they don't have to be violent people but they become very lethargic and laid back wow euphoria relaxation by the oldest sense of your body and your mind yeah so the exaggerated laugh pastor they may not be um seemingly be an outward danger but internally they're a danger which then results in their the impact of the family to where they're a danger individually they think they're fine but they have just become a danger yes but as we had said last week when you talked about the welfare and all of that yes go towards getting my marijuana so the excuse that they make oh i don't have to buy it my age boys give it to me or my ace girl somebody's got to buy it and somebody's paying the price and somebody at the top is bringing it in and making a profit again off of people so are we saying then that bermuda government is going to be the one that's going to be the drug the legal drug pusher to push drugs to our families so that it could be bred off at the table of individuals or children who are in that environment watching their parents use drugs huh my chances of use and drugs is going to be the same furthermore if my parents function which you call a functioning attic that's all a function and addict is a person that gets up and still goes to work they still get a badge sometimes if schizophrenia ain't come in because skit spreading worrying about no no bad but these people are functioning addicts every day they go to work but they need their drug in order to remain calm cool and collective and as they quote call functioning so if then i can be functioning at a hundred percent i'm probably functioning at about 80 and i think i'm cool so the fastest soccer player on the field used to be slipped and used to be sharp all of a sudden is not running so quick because he's out of breath because marijuana has taken a toll on his respiratory so he he can't do a 90-game so he'll probably be substituted so i say to even young people have aspirations of going overseas to perform at that international level mary jane is not the person that you want to take on yes furthermore if the rest of the world is is drug free in sports why would bermuda be going there how do you then tell your your legal sports body you know not to do or help them with our youth if you're putting the poison out there it seems like a house divided against itself is gonna fall so if it's not thought through at all in fact it's poor poor thinking so if money is the motivation we are in big trouble and depending on the on the quantity and the quality and the method of consumption marijuana can produce that feeling of euphoria yes hi and they love it but brain cells dopamine so the somebody asked the question last week and i wrote it down the effects of the marijuana on the pregnant woman and the unborn baby and again the problems with child development during and after pregnancy so one of the study by anita found that 20 of pregnant women 24 years old and younger screen positive for marijuana 20 now if smoking a cigarette was not right how did marijuana become less than marijuana has more tar and additionally in one study of of dispensaries non-medical personnel at marijuana dispensers were recommending marijuana to pregnant women for nausea but medical experts want against it so there is no human research connecting marijuana used to the chance of miscarriage otherwise i mean has anybody ever said that's the reason they had a miscarriage if they used on that one no they're not going to tell you that so we are doing more research although animal studies indicate that the risk for miscarriage increases if marijuana is used early in pregnancy although anita and some have associations have been found between marijuana use during pregnancy and the future developmental and hyper activity disorder in the children the effect adhd attention deficit hyper activity disorder so we want the wife of the all every place and the teachers calling them rude oh they're not listening to me they're not paying attention to me or they want to put them in a special school because of the adhd but then again if mom was doing marijuana where she was carrying me then chances are possibility and this is all about research so marijuana has shown that pregnant women who use marijuana have a two to three times greater risk of stillbirth so is she still going to use in many instances yes because she's now addicted i need my mary jane i wouldn't use as much i'll just do one a day but you're feeding it now into that unborn child and gynecologist they went against it we protect our unborn young ones not try to send things down to the placenta or in the breast milk because there are also studies to show that that's what has hap what's happened now this is one of the leader that they put out recent trend in treatment admission of marijuana use during pregnancy and we see from 1992 right to 2012 it started to go up and up and up and then of course good doctors tell them what you're doing is not good so it gets down on the decline but certainly we see that it went up and the effects that it had on the prop on the pregnant woman animal studies have shown that the moderate concentration of thc when administered to mothers while pregnant or nursing could have long lasting effects on the child including increasing stress responsibility and abnormal patterns of social interaction so when you see these children who are just withdrawn and you wonder what's wrong animal studies also show learning deficit in prenatally exposed individuals and yes they've been able to do it already but if it's affecting the rat and most of the uh species that they use is red but it's still science it's still research and it brings out results for humans that's why we can get two cures for types of cancer so don't say that so on the animal what else you're gonna use but they are the specialists they are the scientists and so therefore we have to listen to the experts and again these are children who have deficit problem-solving feels memory skills ability to remain attentive in school not the child's fault a product of their environment a product of their parents so we're talking about prenatal exposure and of course most doctors would not recommend it and also the breast fleeting one study suggests that moderate amount of thc fung found their way into breast milk when a nursing mother uses marijuana and some research shows that exposure to thc through breast milk in the first month of life could result in decreased motor development at one years of age for the child and there are other things as it relates to the brain and the development of the young person when it relates to pregnant women and if it's all right or not we had some parents who tried some things on babies the baby didn't make it because we get this thing in our head that if we could as adults can do it but let's give it to the children give our children a chance they are our future and as i said if all people want to be fatty dog but don't mess with our future our heritage god's heritage marijuana and its effect on the young mind and as much as regular users would like to think that we is an entirely harmless drug really it's not marijuana the use of it has not only been leaked to significant number of short-term psychosocial problems including problems with school work family friends and the law and i know what i'm talking about but how does this affect the young mind because they can't they can't make it in school and therefore self-esteem is going down because i used to know how to do this work i really did you know so mama you're always picking on me but i was making good grades no you know nobody weren't saying anything yes they were but now it's changed so why has it changed because nobody's thinking about a drug test a screen a urine test and often times when i see young people who were a students or b students or you know hey they may not be they pass or see but when i see them flunking out i said do you think that they're doing marijuana well you know the behavior has changed take them get a drug screen get them urine tested so the effects on them may last a long time or even be permanent and that's why many young people do end up down maui because they end up suicidal or they want to hurt somebody else because then their anger is assassinated and it's high can't explain why i'm going off like i'm going off but we'll look at this through this next document the distribution of cannabinoid the receptors in the rect brain and the brain image reveals high levels shown in the orange and the red in this section right here this is called the hippocampus and this is the complex brain structure embedded deep into the temporal lobe and it has a major role in learning and memory so when mary jane gets in here i remember too much what'd you say huh oh what the ball ran into the net i didn't know that oh we call them the punchy because they miss that it has a major role in learning and memory and it can get damaged by a variety of stimuli and marijuana can be that stimulant studies have shown that it also gets affected in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders so attached to that if a person was predisposed their marriage may heighten it and so you see their bipolar tendencies disorder comes up and it might be heightened or schizophrenia so if they're smoking so it may be more intense they're hearing more voices now so rather than take their medication they're taking mary jane but mary jane is only intensifying it more so we we talk about this area right here in the brain that affects the memory and alters how the hippocampus the brain area is responsible for memory formation so research has shown that marijuana negative affects our attention memory learning can last for days or weeks and marijuana can stay in your system you know for a month so you test positive and we had a lot of uh individuals who um mary jane was feeling the system and they said well i use it you know but we could tell by the the the level of of the drug in the system if they have or have not and they have some drug tests that will show you the level and the potency of the drug so if the potency of the drug is more than the last drug screen then guess what you just blew it because you that means you use some more and they think they're beating it the only person they're getting beaten is you because you still got to play the drug pusher and just imagine that our government is trying to be a legal drug pusher calling it regulation let's let let's let's not insult intelligent people in this island especially rackets go ahead do it remove it from there so that no they're not criminals it's not on the record but certainly do not lead them to believe that they're okay if they continue to smoke because some of them want to be soccer players they want to be basketball players they want to be athletes and you're going to put some drug out here that's going to make it easy accessible for us uh-uh no records also showed that a lot of them were not able to graduate did not graduate reduce the chances of graduating 48 relevant studies from marijuana used to be associated with reduced educational attainment and we put them in these remedial schools and and you know we tell them i'll get your ged ged it's just a baseline we shouldn't be telling our our young people if they get a ged okay that's a baseline that's just a school leaving certificate we want to press our young people to be better than what we were but do not set them up but they also had a much higher chance of developing dependence using other drugs attempting suicide as we said being depressed staying at home overeating or not eating enough eating everything out of the refrigerator so now your grocery bill is 400 from 200 eating every bit of sugar because they gravitate to the sugar the chocolates and everything so you can't keep anything in your refrigerator and as people edge they lose the neurons in the hypocampus which increases their ability to learn new information can't take it in i don't know what you're talking about i know what you're talking about talk to my wife talk to my husband i don't understand all of that can't comprehend anymore and so it hastens their age related laws of the hypocampus neurons so in one study we found out that rats that were exposed to thc every day for eight months approximately thirty percent of their lifespan showed a level of nerve cell loss so when we talking about a little bit brain day sure enough because it chips away at those brain cells animals twice their age ah they under respiratory problems okay you think smoking is bad now i've had some people tell me and i i laugh every time they do they say i don't smoke i say really well i don't smoke cigarette i don't smoke cigarettes i said i said but you smoke weed and that's got more tar in it than the tobacco cigarettes but you're you're causing now the breathing problems we're talking about tobacco my gosh and they mix it with tobacco so you got double lung diseases high chances of lung infections and the study also marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than those tobacco and you know why because we got to inhale deep so when we draw any marijuana you know you know we're doing the deep thing so you're going into your lungs even more and deeper can we get real here and then you know um i'm irritable i can't sleep you know i can't sleep all night you're pacing the floor and you got to go outside four o'clock in the morning you got to get a joint because you got to go to sleep or you get up in the morning i got to go to work so i can get my journey and launch time i need to go home i gotta get a sniff i gotta i need to function here not knowing that you're pressing the dependency issue like i said the man takes a hit the hit wants a hit and then the hit wants demand so marijuana users are also more likely to develop temporary psychosis long-lasting mental disorders including schizophrenia does marijuana have withdrawal symptoms oh yes and the average marijuana user does not even realize they are going through withdrawals what some of the effects anxiety anxious irritability sleeplessness craving decreased appetite or increased appetites oh i gotta have this i need a chocolate and then eat that whole chocolate they go get another one and another one and then you look the teeth are all rotten all out or it's turning all brown or spaces in between the teeth used to be a commercial that we had in bermuda it was about smoking nicotine and the guy he smoked the smoky smoke until his face was just like a snake don't realize that it changes our our whole persona many useless will report they are not addicted but cannot explain why they need to function in order to get to sleep why i need a split why i need to kick start my day like i said many of them are operating in denial but then again someone will tell you look i'm addicted i am addicted and you feel good about it so now you can't talk to to your master the master talks to you the only thing it's not in a person isn't in a little bit of weed or is in a bottle the alcohol and none of them is bad than the other so don't don't come and say well we've got alcohol the illegal drug and as i said i don't see anybody giving anybody a license to kill each other with these guns that they run around here who's given who's given them a license to kill each other respectfully let's just kill each other you know nicely it's not happening so marijuana use can lead to development of problem use disorders marijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence and so most people who are uh are diagnosed you will find out that they will be diagnosed also with marijuana dependence on the axis mood swings okay so in 2015 about four million people in the united states met the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder and 138 000 voluntarily saw treatment for their marijuana use out of 4 million so again these are some of the withdrawal the uh irritability anorexia weight loss weight gain brought on by excess eating and strange dreams a lot of report that they had a lot of strange dreams so denial is a huge factor with the drug because the effects are are many times not quickly identified in fact with marijuana just one of the slower ones but rest assured you use me and i'mma tell you that you're using me i'ma let people see that you're using me because your looks will change your edge quicker your memory is not that sharp your concentration not that quick you're not a skiller on the field anymore of soccer so your chances of becoming a professional football player what people out there running shotguns around you because then your breathing is hindered so then what about marijuana and driving somebody asked the question uh you know will they be testing you know bus drivers that's something that you have to actually bermuda government i don't know if they thought about it because if you put it out there to send it to them and if that bus driver how can you then accuse them of testing positive and going on the bus and driving somebody so the low levels of marijuana can impair driving ability because marijuana does affect your judgment also it affects your perception if something is closed or not your motor skills so there we are a lot of you had questions which are questions for your bermuda government why they didn't ask the principals and the school teachers why didn't they again i said nobody wants to rock the boat so uh i don't know if any uh principal is gonna go out there on the ledge out there and say well you know you can't do this or go on tv no their job and that's why a lot of these uh entities need to be separate from government i agree because many times when government has their hands in things it only causes chaos i don't care how good they may be doing but the professionals who have gone to school to learn to basically invest in their children and take time out cannot then say look you can't do this because it's affecting my child my student you're putting this drug out there on the streets and the drug people that's the thing i'm gonna make money at whose expense everybody else's and then your own family gets caught up in it so you could say the bermuda government is the big parent but at the end of the day the whole family is going to get caught up in it and we're going to get shown out so we're going to have more social issues with less social workers what's going to happen to the drug court overflowed overwhelmed what's going to happen to maui ever overflowed we'll have to build another facility suicide of our young people depressed and don't know why they're depressed so from the centers of disease control national institute of drug abuse national institute on drug abuse for teens you could google it you'll find out what you need to know but do not sit there and say that you do not know and you do not understand because there is enough information out there for you to understand and our seniors don't do this to our seniors don't put this stuff in their backyard where they can't sleep because of the smell who's going to police it you cutting back on the police budget certainly things are going to be more more out there you're going to need more police the other the other day they were on the news they don't have the the scales to raise their seven ounces so you're leaving the police at the deficit marijuana is a schedule one but also also one in the schedule one we have drugs that are in schedules and with her is ecstasy molly she's there in the schedule along with the other drugs and so this is our educational uh portion as much as we can and there's a lot of research out there everything is research-based i'm not trying to tell you anything that the national anita hasn't done or samsha has not reported but it's up to you to try to uh go and investigate before you say yes to the bermuda government don't let them slip this in on you pastor you have really i feel educated us in detail i i it's like i could feel every sentence helping us to understand that we're we are headed on the slope that is so slippery and we won't be able to catch a generation to come we won't be able to catch them from falling you know i was driving thinking about this and and i thought about it as you spoke i remember in science learning about darwinism and this is like i said this is like darwinism it's the survival of the fetus you put all the traps out there all the negative things and just see who's dumb enough to go for it and if that that dumbbell they deserve to fail and the rest of us will reign we'll be in charge and i feel that's what's happening what parent does that to the child what government does that to the people that they represent a government that wants to remain in control and have told the people this is how you make money so it's money other people as you keep saying it's about the government saying we are going to be the legal people and just because you're the legal business does not mean the business is legal because if the business that you're selling is disrupting the minds the neurotransmitters the synapse don't know how to act but you can put that child in a classroom we don't have enough classrooms now we don't have enough counselors now but our government is going to put somebody may say well it's not for the children but then they get it now when it's illegal so when they get more of it being legal duh nah and it is almost you know i laugh sometimes you keep on crying because it's like ray charles lee and stevie wonder you wonder where where are they going where are we going where are we going we just we're talking about freeing our people from slavery and we're about to take our people back into slavery into mental slavery again mental slavery financial slavery how are we going to stimulate a compass by you getting the money and put the people in poverty so then more social workers and you get right back into poverty because now you've got to pay them because your social issues are that high so so therefore hold on sounds like a chain gang to me by the way a chain gang sounds to me like those that have will have more meaning those who are the educated who are the social workers the elitists the entitled people they're going to have more because they're going to have to now cure which they're going to do of course they're going to have to try to counsel and deal with these imbeciles these illiterate heathens who have partaken of these substances it's like they just failed the test and they deserve to be where they deserve i this just feels so wrong on so many fronts but the sad part about it these are this this the next generation these are future leaders this is the next premier's mind so maybe the next premier is coming from a family that wasn't so dumb to partake in that substance even though it was legalized so a certain amount of people even though they're letting all the bermuda yeah you can have it they're gonna make sure their children don't have it or it's controlled or it's dealt with you see what i'm saying it's still creating a cash system it's something that has been going on because the statistics uh they show um they're not accurate statistics because many times when even caucasian children got caught up their parents took the money and sent them abroad again the black parents don't have money to send our children away real quickly so that they don't become a statistic but they may go out to united states and commit suicide but at least they're not in this culture so that everybody knows so then we continue to operate at a deficit because i want to be rich too the government's getting rich i'm going to be rich too of course i'ma break the law why should you be happy all by yourself so this legalization of weed is not going to turn the um is not going to turn the street business weird person into a now upstanding business person of course not i'm competing with you because now your government and you're taking all the business i'm not making it much as much money and so really isn't that how another substance arises on the black market of illegal substances to be the next thing that they control that the government's not controlling because the government took away their business company is sticking away to business i see more problems i'm tired you just made me tired you made me more tired ah psychologically you could become drained if you look at this because these are supposed to be intelligent people and even though they want to use a throw of words and again i asked the question why did you wait to the midst of the pandemic to strategically introduce this this bill i'll tell you why it makes all these sense in the world because the people are already under pressure feeling intense and so those that are still that are open got the drug got weak i got weed during the pandemic that's saying well this is helping me escape if it weren't for mary i don't know how i'll be dealing with it so what it is i'm going to go to the christian side of it is we've set up a mini god um i answer small g to people's issues so again they're moving away from elohim to this weed and then trying to blame god for planting uh planting the seed for the natural plane not understanding god didn't mean to destroy all the um the the the connections that the drug could be used for for good you're supposed to destroy them through smoking and fire no combustion not in your brain so even if it's medicinal purposes that it was put here certainly that's not what i wanted i want to smoke my pipe and i want to get high i'll tell you what doctors are going to get richer because they're going to have a lot more appointments with a lot more people with asthma and the rest of it so you the rich will get richer and the poor will get poor of you have so much social ills in this country huh what they say you can't even lick a stick at it the courts will be loaded because if they if they seriously think that people's going to basically adhere to the rules the regulations that they set they're not smart they're not smart at least they have a level of control now and i and i submit you know uh in this island 22 square miles somebody's turning a blind eye two ways in here you can't come come over the border from state to state like america two bears in by boat and plane who's turning a blind eye to this oh yeah definitely definitely and so what we're going to find is if it becomes legal all of a sudden you're going to know right away oh you see how it's been coming in because you can't come in like hey jack snap fast maybe if i'm a big business person nobody's gonna check me out we're about to destroy a generation even more we are about to lose control at a state that we are not ready to deal with and and then when you even think about um numbing i don't want to deal with stuff as i say to individuals who who use drugs when you come down from your high or you're numbing you still got to deal with life on life's terms yeah so if nothing is all that there is let's let's deal with the reality let's not try to escape which we normally try to do in so much so many things because it's a spiritual warfare whether you once don't want to recognize it or not and guess what the enemy has found another way to destroy you escapism yep so when we're talking to the teens the young people middle school secondary school about peer pressure we're walking right into it oh yes we say because they're all doing it so since they're all doing it which they're not uh then we might as well just open it up but what's really happening is the uh the year 2020 the modern day black 40 thieves who are gonna make money of it or the new 40 thieves front street whoever they are because it certainly can't be me it's gonna be people with the with the ability to hire these soldiers on the street this thing can't be pretty it's gonna need some soldiers we would need to increase uh the regimen oh stop talking crazy stop talking crazy yeah well in the midst of pandemic did we not do a boss did we not did we not seize them a whole lot of marijuana uh cocaine uh mali did we not seize it in the midst of a pandemic yes you just think that the man's mind's gonna stop trying to find a way to make money why the government's talking about they're gonna um be the legal pushers so so the government and all that brilliance they think they're going to be the legal pushers are not going to outdo the real ones that are on top of this thing holy smoke they may have to go to them because canada now uh you know the ones that they're looking at have had to go to the black market because they cannot produce enough for the people that are using that's the sad part about it so again as i said last week and some people may laugh i'm gonna have to go to the bush and say hey you got a garden snacks for me anywhere 22 square miles long and then spiritually speaking we've got to then pray away all the evils that will come up against this island because prophetically this is supposed to be the lighthouse and we're turning it now into what lighten it up and the choices we make just with everything else we're gonna have to deal with the consequences we're gonna have to deal with the consequences well pastor you have like i said certainly educated myself and bermuda and this tuned in i saw a friend from boston she's tuned in and um truth is out there your hands are clean my hands clean and for that reason we know that god is on our side i just want to um you know encourage parents and you know fight for your children fight for your children don't let the government railroad you like this fight for your children fight for your heritage because it will be yours it will be your child or your grandchild or your great-grandchild they will be the ones using this marijuana talk about peer pressure and fights and somebody wanting you because you look clean you're a clean student to carry to do this carry the drug saudi drug and you're afraid of the bully say this situation is not gonna end well a lot of schools will close because they're not gonna be able to fill them at least not those ones they're gonna have to build more remedial schools schools of children with special learning as i've been saying you're saying that i'm saying this i hear nothing of the chief education officer and commissioner everybody everybody's got the degrees but ain't nobody saying anything they're hired by government oh right the hands are tied they're shut down the mouse is shut down but they'll be the same people complaining one thing i've often said you can sleep with the devil and witness to him too well yeah so if you find yourself in bed with the devil you certainly can't witness to you and it makes you a poor witness and and like i said we're gonna go through some hurricanes and the rest of it and so then the church has to be praying lord sparrows we're opening us what does it mean to open up pandora's box you can't handle it now you can't control it now what what what would possess you to go down this road and stop deceiving the people and telling them that you're doing it for the black man and you're not doing it for the you're doing it for the black market your earned pockets it can't be for the children that black man now the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help us god you cannot do this to god's people and expect god to come back to you my lord because doom will come on you doom and sudden destruction and it's a word because if you do this to god's people you will pay a price and it will be a big one well pastor let me say it's been a surreal lesson having you as my guest and talking on this subject subject uh the compromised borders i you know it's like the immune system and it's compromised you know whatever just enters in and just wreaks havoc on the body and i do feel that this is this gateway you know we we as pastors as ministers we are supposed to be prophetic which means we stand at the city gates and we speak the truth we warn the people and in that sense i do take joy that god has connected us for this season and we are at the city gates speaking and that means that we have done that which is required of us and i can only pray we can only pray that governments someone in government christians in government church people in government in government they say no we it's not worth this type of money we can't sell our children for money like that we can only hope and as our citizens view this we begin hopefully to hear an uprising and people begin to call their politicians as you would say and ask them what are you doing here don't you see that this has already impacted bermuda for generations in a negative way don't you understand our school children suffer some children yearly they're given school clubs and the rest of it because they have parents who are hooked on to to this drug and we're going to do what with it we're going to do what classrooms what classrooms are students bouncing off the wall don't know how to and we're going to do what we've done we've done of the watchman being on the wall as an intercessor when we go before god and intercede on behalf of the nation i can't speak for anybody else but i i listen for an answer because i want to have a dialogue with a with a father who cannot speak to me so when the church say that they're praying on issues i want to know what has the lord said to you come on now talk to me talk to me say something say it if i'm dialoguing with you just as we're dialoging we are speaking to each other and we are getting answers so when we pray as watchmen on the road on the wall to keep up the inroads of the enemy then what is the lord saying to us he's always told us that i've raised you up to speak to kings and princes where's the voice in bermuda because we're too satisfied with what we have we don't want to rock the boat we're comfortable we're doing okay we're going to protect our own children so the rest of you if you choose to do that wow our hands we we will be held accountable that's the bottom line today it's very spiritual and it becomes spiritual because when you mess with god's people you mess with god and so so now i have to pray lord cover this island absolutely spare us all the more because you have already sent prophets into this island that have spoken over this island that this will be the the prophetic place of of soul winning and we're turning it into a den of three thieves robbers pushers hypocrisy is what it is and so again um i use the opportunity not for for nothing else but i have a god to glorify and guess what that's the only person that i have to listen to today the god of my salvation and because i'm academically trained in a field it's still i have to listen to to god because these are god's people that we deal with on a daily basis we're not raising up a generation of vipers these are god's people and we must be very careful how we handle god's people and don't put out their poison for them don't trap them god is about life and anything that steals demeans uh robs the folks of life is not of god and so i'm i'm very saddened that we in bermuda have reached this place again but if i think back 10 years ago five years ago three years ago somebody would tell me that the government the plp government who happens to be the most of them the race if not all of them 90 of them the race of the population that's most negatively impacted by weed will pass something to legalize it again like you decriminalize it yes we don't want you to be a criminal you need help uh you know expunge the people's off the you know list whatever fine um use it medicinally yes yes fine but to put it in that way out there where it is already a danger delayed and and and put it out there as as pushy and and strange enough if you look at the remit and all of the mandate for uh the uh ruling party of the day it was to decriminalize it nothing about legalizing and cultivating it enough culturally so if people are telling you uh you know it's going a little bit further then where are your uh um ritz and smart to say no you know and out of your survey and your consult 520 people that should have told you something because when you went on the government website it was very hard for you to even make comments because they directed you things to comment on so you can tell me to come on and give consultation if you are there telling me what to do otherwise the mind is made i'm not the blunt do you think it should be legalized or do you think it should not be but don't stop talking about cultivation and growing and regulating and putting words in there that seems like words of a fool to me because one thing one thing i'm not when it comes to to to this this field and that's a fool i've had to try to help people not to become fools to a drug and so well again if your remit was to to to do that as part of of what you said you were going to do for 2019 2020 then stick to what you've done you tabled something in the house of assembly i admonish you to stop it's known commit doom and destruction i think it's just such trickery you put legalization when you're writing legalization in the platform did you already know you really wanted to sell it and just make money for government i i wouldn't i would have had something to say about that well guess what you'll never get out of that deficit no and let me tell you something you can get out of the financial deficit let's pretend that happens but the spiritual the family the educational the deficit there you'll never get out of that and and i and i and i say that because when you mess with god's people you think you're going somewhere you go nowhere try to make us like make it make us to be fools axe our room yeah yeah well pastor for someone who told me they didn't have a whole lot of talking to do you did very well amen praise the lord and i tell you what it's been absolutely wonderful in the sense that i believe you've given quite a lot of detail it's not just it's not merely our passion or opinion it's scientific facts and so therefore people are not gonna be able to say oh they're just talking no it's a whole pile of people that do a whole pile of researching so that we could talk on what we're talking uh tonight this evening and um stay tuned pastor uh again i i want to thank god for you uh this time of sharing and um let's let's see what god has us doing for the next step uh certainly i believe that you have done bermuda and the kingdom proud in in your delivery of this information so god bless you and god bless you and god bless everyone that tuned in to us thank you thank you do not take it lightly do not let it rest but go do your research and do not let the cancer worm come in and steal from us with that said facebook again thank you folks for tuning in and we know some folks will catch the replay and whatnot make it a matter of prayer make it a matter of making calls to your local mp it's time to start uh letting politicians know that this is not just gonna happen wow just smoothly without there being a noise from those that have been gifted to speak out and make the clarion call and that's what we're going to do so again god bless you thank you for tuning in and we'll we'll catch you on the next time blessings abound [Music] god [Music] you", "0_hzG88HlSE": "[Music] here we go we're back at it again we hit up your people here

the video out i did the uh review out there between syria revolutionary and also ahead of your people at liberty cannabis with the strain brand they got some fire they failed in many different ways as far as that review went for the revolutionary product service and overall experience so this time we'll give it another shot because i believe in giving everything another chance another opportunity so here we go folks we've got today afghani purple yeah i mean it sounds fire high thc big numbers this should be a winner let's go ahead and give this baby a pinch let's see what you do you're in first what do you say fam how's that look get in here look at that where was this when i needed it look at that that little trunk it has a has a kind of a fresh smell i will say that there's no boat with a pack no boost it it does rock this slightly fresh smell sometimes it happens let's get it in the grinder that's out of here we're gonna roll the whole [ __ ] up as always we got the vibes we got some blunt bills today and you know the torch game is heavy let's go ahead and get into this review we'll ride this [ __ ] up and let's see what it do what's that you see the grinder on the train nah here it goes check it out i've been getting into this a little bit this resin made it's pretty dope black and green colors like the final fan yeah that's right my little sister made this for me she's doing a little thing starting out a a business she put together a rolling tree put together this grinder i told her i'd check it out i only usually review stuff that i've used i've enjoyed or that i think you should know it's the straight-up [ __ ] and to stay away from it as you know i'm into backwards i smoke blunts we use a grinder it tends to grind it up very fine very powerless little tiny teeth i don't know if you can see here i've got some use out of this get your [ __ ] in there and give it a little grind just like this and it's got pretty good little grip there we go let's get this on the train nice and clumpy as you can see it got that clump factor so it's gonna grind something up and you don't want it to turn to powdery dust and you know gonna roll yourself up wood go roll yourself a bluntville dutch master you need a little more chunk than fine powder work i've enjoyed the hell out of it this is something i got given with love thanks sister i appreciate you i told you i wouldn't talk about it on the video but i love the hell out of this thing shout out to my sister you can find our instagram i'll leave a description down below custom creations by elizabeth she's got these little things going on masks all kinds of little trinkets my sister's very crafty that's not my thing that's more weird i get into this but let's get into the review there it is it's a little just ah again they have this eye drying it it doesn't it doesn't really smack you there ain't no smack smack in this let's roll the [ __ ] up put some fire to it let's see what it do there it is we got it all rolled up the afghani perk what else could we do put some fire to it i got my fingers crossed on this one toes knees i'm hoping this [ __ ] is going to be good come on afghani perk let's go you looked okay [ __ ] up little drying process i don't know what goes on there and had that off kind of smell let's see i got nothing on the first one there was no excitement involved there diving back in [Music] i don't know funeral fam i'm three four five seven pulls in once again we got a sizzler here on our hands sounds like i just popped a [ __ ] soda this thing is straight sizzling just like that solar pop seltzer sound when i think of the words afghani and i think of the words purple i don't come up with anything else in my mind except for funky and berry this is just as bland as the smell and the taste the look it's good the dry it's so [ __ ] weird i don't i don't know how they get it to the end point or what they're doing but it's it's not they should have snap crackle and popping let me get back in well at least i got my fresh cup something else that my little assist rocking here she hit me with this that's that gsr drip on the cup you can get yours however you'd like this is what i wanted got the flag draped the colors going down i think it came out pretty dope this kind of stuff she does you do any kind of custom orders you want your design your labels and she's a small business so go ahead and try to support somebody local if you want i'm not asking you to i'm just telling you that this is the kind of work she does it's good stuff the grinder you see how it does if you're smoking these woods smoking these blood fills it great gives you a nice little chunk you'll end up with that fine powder mess this afghani purple nah i can't i don't wanna for the 60 bucks it cost me for this blunt i really really want this to be good i really really wish that this had some kind of boop bap or anything you know a papa a little smack a little something but it's just so not there it's just so bland it's just a waste it looks pretty decent it's just not carried the right way to me not dried the right way to me this is all again in my opinion what the [ __ ] do i know i only been in cannabis for 30 years a resume that is not written down anywhere you know people always ask me about myself there's nothing i can tell because i wouldn't ever tell myself this right here though i will tell you about it it [ __ ] sucks afghani purp bom you're going in the trash you're out of here bro i ain't [ __ ] with you you know fam as always thanks for coming out thanks for watching the show thanks for rocking with your boy and as always stay high as you want to be peace", "6klJ1KfIQEk": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps and today on this very windy day we're going to be checking out some more affordable rising guys so yeah like i like i said in the title this is another one of the cheap roses this is the lowell herb co lemonade aged cured rosin so this is about 55 a gram out the door and like i said for rosin it's pretty cheap so i'm not sure if you guys seen the video yet maybe you have or maybe you haven't released it but there is another cheap brand of rosin called uh honey butter and they make some great stuff so um gonna see if this can top that so the honey butter rosin is 45 dollars that's 55 and rather normally floats around 80 to like 90 bucks a gram so very expensive normal uh you know in any normal circumstance so yeah hopefully these you know products encourage more affordable rosin to come out so let's take a look at the stats shall we this is the pink lemonade hq rosin once again uh here's the backing for y'all right there just in case uh it didn't it doesn't focus this is the stats 656 percent thc uh 1.65 milligrams of cbd so that's probably about uh 1.6 uh cbd there uh i don't think yeah we're not seeing too much of yeah no there's no cannabinoid percentage here but i do like the packaging of this this box is super sturdy like listen to that it closes like that it feels like uh like a jewelry box you know when you open this thing up if you feel like a little bit like royalty or i guess a little fancy maybe not royalty is the right word but yeah so this is the cured rosin that is inside and it smells phenomenal guys it smells a lot like flour of course like most rosin does and it's got a really really nice soury cut heart kick to that smell so a lot a lot on the nose for uh you know that pink lemonade name you know you like you like having that uh that sourness of course from the limonene and a little bit of sweet tartness there from whatever wherever else that might come from sorry guys i'm only really familiar with limonene as a profile but yeah we're gonna take a fat glob boys a fat glob right there and then i'm gonna let you guys know you know how it feels when i'm tasting all that good [ __ ] so cheers [Music] hmm oh uh [Music] it's still quite a bit to go here boys whoo try to finish it on one rip so i didn't finish it there it is that should be the last of it [Music] okay okay so what i'm tasting and what i'm feeling so i'm going over the taste before it tastes a lot sweet or not a lot sweet a lot of that like limony kind of uh you know citrusy kind of limey kind of like or a lemony flavor yellow tininess at the end there with the slight tones of sweetness not too bad on the taste actually you know like i said it tastes a lot like smoking flour so i imagine excuse me so i imagine this is how the pink lemonade strain you know tastes now like terms of potency this thing definitely hits hard you know a lot of people see aged or or aged cured silver they you know they see cured resin cured sauce all that stuff and they just automatically assume it's old weed and you know that's right in some regards but not really you know like hearing something doesn't necessarily make it worse or old you know i mean i you know well don't say old because technically curing something you know the product is going to be older than when it was fresh but you know it's curing something isn't bad at all i used to love curing my nuts you know keeping me in the jar for a little bit longer letting them lose a little bit more of that moisture just so they can dense up more and get to uh a kind of like i was about to say consistency but you know a kind of level of you know that i like you know like i like then snugs with a little bit of moisture i don't like it too moist you know i don't want to touch it and feel kind of like feel it kind of wet i like it when it's a little dry there's some bounce to it but um not not too much uh fresh wet kind of smell on there that's my preference though but i do think that sometimes uh you know fresh flour hits a little bit harder than uh cured flour but honestly guys it really is dependent on the strength yeah but yeah in terms of don't see guys this is this is a hybrid first this is hybrid as it says on the box and um i don't know if it leans anywhere uh specifically you know whether it's leaning towards sativa or indica uh right now this isn't the first time i've added this you know i've had in a few other videos maybe you guys have seen those maybe you haven't but um yeah this it's uh it's a little it's always been a little bit rough for me to decide what this one is i feel like it's because the lemony cup taste throws me off and i start thinking oh it's a sativa but like you know the effects get get me kind of stuck so like i just feel like you're not gonna be going out to smoke with other people or hang out with people who don't care if you're loaded i don't know you should go hit this before going outside and starting your day you definitely could get away with it if you got used to the high but me i think i'd like to be a homebody with what i'm dabbing on this one so without further ado i'll take one last hit for you guys and uh yeah so this one isn't as big as the last club because guys i can't lie i'm pretty faded right now but uh we're gonna go ahead and take one last one here for the video and i hope you guys can join me so get the bulls pack some dabs ready get your carpet or you know smoke up that joint and uh cheers boys just drop that in all right here we go all right thanks guys for joining me for yet another video and i hope you guys join me for yet another hit cheers hold on still a little bit more in there sometimes i miss my old rig you know dabbing the old way for those of you who are curious i know i get that question a lot but um you know like i said i'm just waiting to get a new rig and then i'll probably be dabbing again on a banner because i have turp pearls and all that stuff that i should be using okay yeah that's about i'm gonna do it for the video so once again our flavor profile we have here it's a little sweet a lot of that you know limonene kind of lemon lemony citrus piney um honestly it's really delicious you know like any rosin this tastes a lot like uh flour would taste i think you know in terms of its taste you know because flour has a distinct taste when you're smoking it then a concentrate does you know sometimes concentrates have their own kind of taste and i feel like that's just because uh when you extract something down to its very like essence like most concentrates pretty much are you're like you're gonna lose some stuff you know there's definitely some uh compounds in flour that make it taste more you know more distinctly um yeah and uh in terms of potency well this is a hybrid you know i did get i am i do feel kind of like a tv high like in the upper area but um you know i could definitely fall asleep off this too if i laid down or if i uh you know didn't want to do anything this would be a great strain as well i feel like this is a good hybrid because like i said i can't really tell where it lies but you know me personally i feel like it's laying laying there on the indica more side but um yeah the way this is hitting me is more like a 50 50 split i feel like i'm just saying indica just because i like indigo but yeah thanks for watching guys and if you enjoyed this one please like comment subscribe hit that notification bell all that good stuff please i would love to see you guys again on another video see you guys later peace out peace", "9VmAM7_IT60": "Amaury latest

may recognize this some of you may not but for those of you who don't it is Rasen and I'm assuming you probably guessed that from the title but today I'm gonna be sharing with you some practical tips about how to use rosin what it is and just things that you can kind of generally do to keep up with your bow so in this video I'll be kind of gearing things more toward the violin just because that's what I play personally and that's what I am most knowledgeable about but this can also apply to other string instruments such as the cello the viola the bass so if you play one of those instruments and you're looking to know a little bit more about rosin what it is and what it does then just keep watching and if this is the first video of mine that you're watching hi I'm Lauren welcome to the tune project I make videos just like this one every single week I post typically two times a week covers tutorials violin maintenance things like this so if any of that interest here then be sure to hit that red subscribe button below and also click the bell so you can keep up to date and be notified whenever I upload a new video all right now let's talk about rosin so when you get a brand-new bow that has been either just newly haired with fresh horse hair or maybe you've just had a Bowie hair and there's no rosin on it yet what's gonna happen is it's completely clean right so when you go to play no sound is gonna come out of the instrument you'll notice that it's a very light and very Airy sound and if that's happened to you and you didn't know why that was happening it was because there was a lack of rosin rosin is what provides the barrier between the bow here and the string to give it a little bit of friction so that sound can come out of the strings and if we don't have rosin on the hair it just simply does not work so when we have brand new hair brand new horse hair on our bow we want to make sure that the first thing we do is put some rosin on it now there are many different types of rosin and I'll probably leave some photos here to show you different kinds that you might be used to seeing this is the one that I happen to have at the moment Gustav burn Adele is the name of the brand I'm not married to that brand or anything like that I just happen to use this kind I've had it for years and there's different types of rosin there's light rosin there's dark rosin there's rosin that's a little bit stickier and things like that so it's really up to you and your personal preference and the longer that you play the more you'll kind of adopt a preference and rosin type so when you have brand new horsehair that's never been rosin there's no coating of anything on it the way that it was described to me many years ago is that on the horsehair there are many teeny tiny microscopic particles along the hair of the bow that are lying flat up against it okay so what the rosin does is when we apply the rosin it shoves little pieces of dust underneath those particles so if you can imagine velcro for example if you've ever looked really closely out a piece of velcro you'll notice it has really teeny tiny little hooks on it so that's kind of like what's happening here with the bow is we're just putting pieces of dust from the rosin underneath those microscopic little particles and it causes them to stand up rather than lying flat and that's what causes the friction so when you go to play what's actually causing the sound is all of those teeny tiny little particles kind of coming across the string so if you think of putting velcro across your strings which I do not recommend please don't do that but if you're an imagine doing that you would hear all the little hooks hooking themselves along the strings and it would be just kind of a burst of different sound right so that's what's happening here but on a microscopic level we can't see it and it's so small and they're so miniscule that all we hear is just the end result we hear all of the sound together so that's how we're able to play a solid note into our ears that's what it sounds like but what's actually happening is it's all these teeny teeny tiny little particles that are grabbing onto the string like little teeth or little hooks that are gliding across the string okay so that's what rosin does and that's why we need it in the first place now let's talk about how to apply it to the bow so if you have brand-new rosin it won't look like this mine has indentations of where I've applied the rosin with the bow but if you're if you have brand new rosin some people say that you should scratch it with something like with a key or something personally I've never had to do that I don't really love the way that makes my rosin look when it's all scratched and scuffed and everything and I found it to be perfectly fine and perfectly usable to just go in on brand-new rosin and just start applying it without anything it might take a little bit longer to kind of get the dust out of the rosin but it works so what we want to do is we want to hold the rosin in our left hand and then you'll go ahead and just make a bow hold hold your bow like you normally would and then the bow is what moves across the rosin so I'm just gonna give an example my bow doesn't really need rosin right now but we're just gonna apply a couple layers of rosin and you want to focus on the areas like the Frog because that's where it tends to get rubbed off the most and the tip of the bow as well and generally depending on how fresh your hair is you might need a little bit more if it's fresh or if it's just a freshly hair to bow but if it's like mine where you've been playing on this bow for a while and you've been playing on the bow hair for a while you've rosin dit here and there then you probably only need just a coating of a layer or two and what I tend to do is I don't really have a set schedule for Rosling and I talked about this a little bit in my violin maintenance Hawks video but I generally just apply rosin when my boat needs it and the way to tell if your bone needs rosin is if you're playing and it sounds like there's a blank spot or a bald spot I call it on the hair where you play and it's fine sound is coming out and then all the sudden it just doesn't anymore there's a little kind of gap in the sound or it kind of slips or slides or something like that then you know okay maybe when I set my bow down or something or it knock something and a little bit of rosin got rubbed off and I need to apply some more so that would generally be the only time that you might need some more unless maybe you're playing something where you would like to have a little bit more friction maybe a little bit more a better articulation for the bow depending on what you're playing you might want to go in with some more rosin at that point but generally speaking you really don't need a lot we don't want a Charlie Daniels situation where we have layers of dust underneath the strings it's just it's not necessary we really don't need that much rosin flying off of our bow when we play we just need a little bit of a coating and then the important thing to remember too is and this especially goes to maybe younger players is you want to be careful with your bow about not touching it we don't want to put our fingers on the hair ever because the oil from our fingers actually breaks down the rosin and causes it to come off and it can also be detrimental to the bow hair as well and can eventually start to break that down so just kind of a bow maintenance thing in general but as far as rosin goes that's that's really it guys it's just kind of a matter of applying it when necessary not too much not too often just knowing when it needs it and then hopefully that was helpful in terms of you learning about what rosin is and why we actually use rosin so thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you in my next video and as always happy practicing bye [Music]", "qEHh3MLoDms": "hello hello hello welcome back to another video in our intro to african history series this is pan-african lectures and i'm your host as always dr. Cindy Murphy ma today we are talking about the development of colonialism in the 20th century its growth and its its evolution its establishment and as was the resistance that continued to audit in the past few which we've spoken about the Scramble for Africa we've spoken about some of the 19th century resistances you know is talking about Bashir a revolt in Tanzania who've spoken about these different things the Anglo surah wars the last of the frontier Wars between the the whites of the tour sign South Africa at the Gaza resistance we've spoken about the shorn and the belly uprisings in Zimbabwe so we continue on that tip just that now we are into the 20th century so yeah let's get right into it and if you haven't already make sure you like the video subscribe share it tell somebody to tell somebody to tell somebody so we cannot continue to have this conversation this is the intro to history series like I said I'll be putting I'll be starting other videos in a few weeks that are more in-depth and more specialized based on my own scholarship but for now this is an intro trophy in history so this is a great place to start with this conversations and as I always I'll put some on my sources in the description so without further ado let's let's get started here and like I said we're talking about colonialism in the early 20th century we are cooking with gas and I will see you guys at the end of the video all right so we touched on this earlier when we spoke about the Scramble for Africa in which I explained that there were four main types of colonial rule and these four types are as goals the first one was the economic companies the economic companies were a staple of the early years of colonialism in which European nations allowed these companies that were granted large territories to administrate in Africa these companies were formed by businessmen who were their focus was on exploiting the natural resources or the territories they were allowed to govern our vergis in the the Sierra Leone Company at the turn of the 19th century then others such as the British South African company owned by Sir John Rhodes which came after the British East African company the companies could set up their own systems of Texas and in labor recruitment and for their part the European powers who provided charters to these companies took responsibilities for all the expenses related to establishing and administering the colonies so this was a good deal for them because they had a political benefit of having additional colonies in Africa but not the expense so so so so that's sort of the the cat's right that the give and take you are allowed to have your company set up shop in in or Devia in South Africa in Kenya and this in these places and you exploit its resources and its people right but your offer the political protection off of the of the British Empire or the German Empire at the time this companies were eventually are successful in that they were unable to generate consistent profits for their shareholders our governor colony is very expensive and the company's faced opposition from Africans from different African groups the missionaries want the missionary started to speak up as well even though we've seen that for example with Reverend Charles helm who work with the British South African company insisted on rosin them to trick Robin gula into signing over the country we've also seen that some of the missionaries although they were agents of the Empire they had they came through with bleeding hearts and so they condemned some of the practice of the companies which is why the economy companies didn't last too long and by 1924 all company rule was replaced by various forms of European colonial government governance which includes this a direct rule that's the second type of colonial rule there was right and this was synonymous with the French the Belgians the Portuguese the Germans so it was a very common colonial system of colonial rule it constituted of centralized administration's usually in urban centres that stress policies of assimilation these that what this means then is the colonialists have the intention of quote-unquote civilizing African societies so that they became more like Europe as part of their strategy colonialists did not try to negotiate governance with indigenous African rulers and governments or in these indigenous authorities where we undoubtedly subordinate in the system of direct rule so what does this mean what this means is there was a spectrum to which the most civilized educated Christian eyes you got you were regarded as being more European that's why in Portugal we talk of the assimilated in the Portuguese Empire we talk about our record assimilators in the French colonies was for we'll talk about how they have all the way which is the evolved ones these are Africans who were on the path to becoming more European there was no regard for for existence structures of Rue and these things then to this day you know part of the the things that you will notice and I've explained this in a previous video is to the extent that French as the language is so ingrained in francophone countries francophone African countries in a way that English which is which had a system of indirect rule which we will talk about shortly is not necessarily ingrained and that is to say culturally what do I mean by that so for example many English speak o Africans from from Anglophone countries are pretty articulate in English but a lot of them are also not whereas and this may be anecdotal I am I have hardly met any Africans from francophone countries who are not at native level proficiency of French that's how and the last part of that is it's a legacy of this of this tradition of direct rule in which the the colonies were an extension of Greater France if you will or what they called it so and we'll talk more about that as we go to the 20th century that's that was what they worked for was indirect rule was something that it was synonymous with the British this system of governance used indigenous African rulers within the communal - tracin although they often maintained and inferior also the Chiefs and and and traditional Kings were still utilized right albeit inferior and in a very manipulated role that served the British overall was a more cooperative model than direct rule the system of governance assume that all Africans were organized as tribes quote/unquote with Chiefs so so that is where it falls short of respecting these traditions because not all systems had that truck would be the long tribe alive and she is right pre-colonial history but they just assumed it that way so a lot of the Chiefs we're maybe influential people in their community prior but they were now posited as Chiefs in a way that disrupted traditional life but that that's indirect true you know which was you know the way Miss Ghana and Nigeria where we're government and and these are the African colonies that were not settler colonies which is the next category we're talking about so the idea was was not so much to make these African people British in the way that the direct would have for the French and the Belgians of the Portuguese but it was a way of just making sure that we are able to extract all the resources that we can from them orbit without totally disrupting the instructor's of life the final rule is known as settler colonial rule or settler rule which refers to the type of colonialism in southern Africa right South Africa Namibia Zimbabwe those places in which European settlers imposed direct rule on their colonies the settler colony is differed from other colonies in Africa in that a significant number of immigrants from Europe settled in this colony so you get people like in South Africa which they maintained the large white population in the millions Zimbabwe as well at the time Rhodesia had several hundred thousands you know the numbers dwindled over the years the post-colonial era Namibia as well significant white population then you go to Algeria in North Africa where there were three million French people set out there at the time of the Algerian revolution so and that is important a lot of people don't think about this when they think about colonialism in other parts of Africa it was these paths were governed by these European powers by proxy they set up administration centers and maybe it maybe had troops so but in some places that the the Europeans actually settled in this countries and that is what is known as settle colonialism and like I said these were found primarily in southern Africa including the columns of south africa south and in northern rhodesia which has involved in Mozambique Angola Mozambique II ah sri sultan motor no diesel just babble in zambia of course southwest africa namibia as well as Kenya then Algeria which we've already spoken about so these are these are the more four main types of colonial rule a particularly interesting case is we're going to into the 20th century and this is something we have spoken about who spoke about it when it's brought about the Scramble for Africa and and and in subsequent chapters or any talk of when we talked about seafood chip and his resistance to to the settlement of the of King Leopold and the Congo Free State so the Congo Free State is already established was given to King Leopold as a result of the Berlin conference as his personal property now the property of Belgium of the Belgian Empire which of which he was of which were sovereign but the price use private property right it was this private belong to him and for context the Congo Free State which is the modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo formerly known as IRA is 2 million square kilometers it is the second biggest African country in terms of space only behind argyria it is 1/4 or they're about the size of the USA so this is a gigantic space right it's a gigantic space also with one of the largest populations on the continent and one of the most resource rich territory so and it belong to him right he does belong to the king so what he would do is he would grant different companies rise to do business in the country in exchange for them building infrastructures you know for example so companies such as the Katanga company or was one such company that came in and settled and had its way with the resources of the country while they would you know build railways and other such things um the main product at the time was rubber that was the the briefing that was being produced in in the Congo Free State so that was the main resource that they were extracting and there was a boom around the world primarily because of the advent of the automobile and bicycle industries so Braavos was a big deal at the time and didn't subside until you know between 1905 and 1910 which we'll talk about shortly so the the group of three states even though colonialism across the board was a very brutal process the Congo Free State is renowned for its brutality renowned for its brutality and I want to take this moment to just plug a book that may be of interest for you if you can find a book called King Leopold's ghost I'll put a link to to it to to it in the description section on Amazon or something because I think it's a great book for any sort of MJ story in North Africa and if you really wanna know more about the Congo Free State and this portal abyss and the ownership develop it's a fantastic book to read but it was renowned for his brutality because the companies had no regard for for for human life and for for for rights or anything like that even the king himself obviously did not care so it even by the brutal standards of colonialism the Congo Free State was particularly brutal and the companies reduce some of the people who have been enslaved by the lack of capital as their army and what proceeded was just a very very ruthless way of doing business one of the let me see if I can find a port real quick that describes some of the conditions in these spaces this is from 1895 from an American missionary working in the in the Congo Reverend JB Murphy who says describing the system it has reduced the people to a state of utter despair astounding the district is forced to bring a certain quantity of rubber to the headquarters of the camisa every Sunday they're soldiers right the ex-slaves were now as the Army's drive the people into the bush which they will not go they are shot down and their left hands cut off and taken as trophies of the commies on these hands the hands of man women and children are placed in roles before the camisa who cause them to see that the soldiers have not wasted their cartridges the camisa is paid a commission about $1 a pound upon all the rubber he gets it is therefore to his interest to get as much as he can let me give an incident to show how this unrighteous trait affects the people one day is a state corporal who was in charge of a post at Lorne if I was going round town collecting robber meeting a poor woman whose husband was away fishing he said where is your husband he then said where is your rubber she answered it is ready for you whereupon he said you lie and shorthair dead shortly afterwards the husband returned and was thought of the murder of his wife the Richard men then raised his gun and killed the Corporal the soldiers run away to the headquarters of the state and made representations misrepresentations of the case with the result that the commissar sent a large force to support the authority of the soldiers the town was looted burned and many people killed and wounded in November of 1894 there was heavy fighting upon the boss IRA because the people refused to give rifle I was told but upon the authority of the state officer that no fewer than 18 1890 people were killed so very very brutal system and at the point there was little concern from Europe from the rest of the world around us right you know late 19th century early 20th century there was little concern a large part of it is because at that ribbon of the Berlin conference really sort of granted the king some sovereignty in this area also the other countries that free navigation as we've discussed before in the in the waterways of the empire are mean of the Congo Free State so folks were not really that concerned and again these African bodies were largely considered to be you know to be spoils of war right however the Congo Free State would collapse by 1908 as due to the work of missionaries and other people starting to spread this word there was growing international condemnation of the activities of King Leopold and the Congo Free State companies and police policing system the other reason why it collapsed is because there was growing armed resistance as many African people as we've already seen that they've started resisting but I started going out there to the eastern coast of Africa the Swahili coast Tanzania and the likes and getting armed so they were starting to put up on resistance as well so the truth was lying down then finally falling robber prices made it unsustainable for some of those companies to maintain that space within the Congo Free State prices were falling in large part due to from an in large part due to the discovery of the discovery of not the discovery there the introduction if you will of plantations in in Asia in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines and the like so it wasn't as profitable as them you know bear in mind this was a very brutal system and the companies I include very interested in just the bottom line so after that they you know the the Congo Free State as we knew it succumbed and became the property of the Belgian Empire despite being the sole property of King Leopold himself but it became the project became part of the Belgian Empire and changed his name to the Belgian Congo the Belgian Congo which would be its name for the most part throughout the other colonial hero of the 20th century now in West Africa right we're back to talking about West Africa Nigeria Ghana these spaces what is interesting about this because remember these were not the settler colonies but they had a between direct rule in the French colonies an indirect rule in the British colonies but the West West Africa provides an insight into the way in which Africans maintained agency and initiative even at the height of the colonial era right and one of the ways that you see that is even though there was a lot of pillaging by the by by by the Europeans and this attempt to assert themselves to continue to assert themselves in a way that they had a view that the slave trade they ended up finding out that it was actually more profitable to live the raw material production in the hands of the peasant farmers right they quickly found this to be more that they are forget to be more efficient producers of the they've done off of these of this raw materials than the plant European plantation owners right because for two reasons one the Africans were very very familiar with the space and then what products brought in the best farming practices that's one the second thing is forced labor is very is notoriously inefficient right and which is why after which is why even the the the institution of slavery as we knew it ended up dying out once more efficient ways with the scuffle right this wasn't it Damascus Road moment where people just got better characters all of a sudden but we've spoken about that in previous weeks so what I did the Europeans did is for the most part in West Africa they they left them the Europeans left the Africa to their colonies alone and encouraged foreign put them to turn away from food crops and produce cash crops for the European markets so and the way they made sure that this encouragement worked was the Africans were heavily taxed by the colonial masters so which means they have to move away from products that maybe they needed themselves make things like cotton and and such and palm oil that would be beneficial to the trip to the market to the European and a global market because they knew that they would be taxed heavily and if they made things that were not as profitable then they would suffer as palm oil remained we've spoken about palm oil already but it remained the the main exporters out of equal land while the production of ground nuts in Senegal also expanded but just to show the impact that colonialism had even as how I remained the main legal and export it just never reached the level of pre of his pre conquest of his pre-colonial production right because again he were being forced into this thing and the interruption of industry by by the European colonialists now cocoa cocoa butter which is again synonymous with Ghana in particular and West African general to this day is a very important example that shows these ideas of African agency in this face now cocoa is not even originally from Ghana it was brought in by by a metalworker from who from Guinea who who brought it in 1879 who brought it to gun in 1879 then he set up a nursery and by 1890s was selling coke was hidden seeds seedlings by the thousand two local peasant farmers now in the British governor sold this and they set up a similar thing you know just hoping to exploit it but the credit for the rapid spread of inland cocoa plantations lay firmly in the hands of local peasant farmers these from these local farmers would buy land from the local accounts and developed a thriving peasant operated cocoa plantation system by 1914 Gold Coast had become the world's largest single produce of cocoa apart from the payment of tax taxes cocoa farmer spend their earnings on important manufactured goods the local building of houses right roads bridges and the education of the children in the mission schools none of these facilities were provided by the colonial government and this would become key in a week or two when I do my discussion on the balance sheet of colonialism the pros and cons of colonialism remember this particular point I met mother none of these things that they built for their communities were provided for by the colonial government it was all as a result of their own enterprising with cocoa and established a whole industry around now let's talk a little bit about the rebellions in the German colonies what characters did the Germans have after the Scramble for Africa well prominently among them were in West Africa cocoa and Cameroon in East Africa they had German East Africa which is modern-day Tanzania okay in then they had German Southwest Africa which is a modern-day Namibia so this is some of the spaces that they had we've already seen some of the resistance the German colonialism at the in the in the end of the nineteenth century they are bashira devote of 1888 and they have a resistance which was led by kava who committed suicide in 1898 to avoid being captured but with the defeat of those two resistance movements and others colonialism was in full effect by the end of the 19th century going to the 20th century this right now we are talking about death in both places that we're talking about right now German East Africa in German Southwest Africa so but in 1898 in German East after the modern day Tanzania and I doubt checks and a dog or a doubt head tax was put in place right which meant that whether you were working or not every adult had to pay tax which is not only it's a very unfair sort of system right because you know a lot of people were not working but they were but then they will that would force them into into enslavement and into into our rest if they were they were if they were not able to pay their they had taxed so and it was also very violently I enforce with the cops very brutal in in in in in seeking payments from from these adults as time moved on right as time moved on the in by 1905 that people are frustrated and what occurred then is something that is referred today is the magic magic rebellion the margin margin rebellion let's talk about the magic magic rebellion the local people remember I've already said that one of the defining features of the colonial colonial authorities was forcing people the local African people to grow goods that they maybe did not need themselves so local people in in Tanzania were forced to grow cotton for export and they revolted against this and this revolt spreads rapidly to other region with attacks on all foreigners missionaries administrators and and the Swahili people that that even there were local people that represented that the colonial colonial authorities you know even though on the surface it looks like it was spontaneous the people of southern Tanzania came together in a way that is unique in the history of African resistance to colonialism so what they did was they turned to their beliefs in the powers of the other spiritual world and the particular thing was what they decided was they sprinkled their bodies with magic water known as the mighty much that's what the name comes from which they believed would turn the bullets of their enemies into water it was a simple device and one which brought the people together so the people sprinkle themselves and they begin to rally right their confidence is through the roof still touched by the ancestors and by the by the spirit world the Germans were amazed by how quickly the spread and the initial success of of their quote-unquote rebels right but the turning point came at the end of only four weeks armed with nothing but Spears and that's them depicted here with nothing but Spears and the maji maji the the African stormed the German machine gun post only to be gunned down more down by India thousands right in their thousands so it was not a positive outcome ultimately however here are some positive results as well one of which was it showed that that the Africans could come together and and unite for a long time at this point was let's assume that tribalism ethnic differences between the different African groups meant they could never come together to resist colonialism this was one of the earliest times that we saw different African groups incomes Aniyah in German East Africa come together in the resistance to colonialism so that was one and it would be a summary deaths repercussions for the rest of the continent as the anti-colonial movement grew throughout the 20th century the other result of this was was that the Germans were slightly less violent in the treatment of the of the colonized African just slightly because they feared that another uprising would occur and the German employers also had to treat their workers a little bit better again these are not huge gain these are not Damascus Road moments that change everything but it's it's there some gains of the movement to the west to the southwest we see what we call the Herero namaha rising we have already seen with what last week about how the nama led by the vid boil the naam and they had error are the two main ethnic groups in this in this in the space of modern-day Namibia the Nama led by vid boy the nominee had arrow and historically had conflict historically at conflict but so when they when the Germans first came in the Herero sought their protection and now my led by vid board at one day had aro that you know you and I we've had our problems but this is African stuff right this idea of your second protection from these white men is only gonna lead to you gonna regret it even if you defeat me today you were gonna live with it and true to his word but the nominee hello were in car entirely under the terms of the Germans by the 28th by the pain of the 20th century in 1904 the very Herrero who had sought the protection of the Germans earlier decide to true to rise up against against the Germans due to what they they saw was what was their brutality and the fact that more and more Germans have been coming in to the space and thereby disenfranchising and more and more so they decide to stage an uprising in 1904 they rose up and killed over 100 German traders and settlers and reoccupied much of their former territory oh this is important in 1897 1898 they've been a rinderpest blight that's a disease that that kills off the bat cause of cattle and the Germans that use advantage of that because a lot of that carols nama and their arrow to create territory and start to claim it for themselves so they were starting to flood it with other German colonial immigrants a few coming from you so this is what the the hetero in reaction to so the Cubans are the traders and settlers and reclaimed much of the attack or former territory however because of that conflict that they restarted confident that they had with their wooded nama they did no we're not able to get them to back the uprising will you approach a bit deadly so it was true late by them truly by then to get the nama to turn them so they did it themselves killed killed a hundred Germans at which point the German commander in chief in in Namibia German West Africa the Southwest Africa commanded the troops to circle up the the the territory in which they had ever lived and announced these words the Herero are no longer German subjects they have murdered and plundered the Herero nation must leave the country very mad at their country right if we do not do so I saw compared it by force inside German territory every embrava tribesmen on Iran armed with all without cattle will be shot no women and children will be allowed in the territory they will be driven back to their people are fired on these are the last words they had a donation from me a great general of the my kitchen German Empire and boy didn't live up to his word massacred there was a population of about 80,000 Reta prior to that only 16,000 remains 80% of the herrera people were killed in that moment right in that moment and eventually 2,000 of them left and moved to which one a land the british protectorate of Quechua delayed which is more than Davis one so it was it was a massacre the nama separately ended up rising up the following year and were slaughtered as well with the food boy killed in 1905 the leader of the Nama the faint lead of the Nama he was older by then but he was also killed and by 1907 they the Germans were in full control you know however by the outbreak of the first world war by 1914 1915 hatred of the German of German rule that becomes so intense that some of the Sultan nama you know welcomed South African invasion in the early months of 1915 right this gelfoam acre will be better than our own devil with widows are something at the time and we'll see how that plays out when as we prosecute the 20th century typically when we talk about the world wars both of them and yeah when we talk about the the world wars it seems that they are quote the world war but we don't really see an African presence in them right and to an extent you get it and I was just having a debate with somebody on social media about this who claimed that you know how dare they call it a world war when when it was just a European war right but the flip side of that is if they were codified at a European war or a Western war it would also be very it would be it would be erasing the important role played by other non Europeans of non-western groups right which famously exposed include the likes of Japan but also it is very important to recognize that Africa was very much involved in both world wars and today we are talking about Africa's involvement in the first world war the first way in which Alfred was obviously involved was there were particular arenas you know the world first world war was fought significantly on earth and continent as well as other places right that's that's one so here's territory such as tobu right which belong to to Germany the Domino's talkin pretty easily and this is why Tobel we remember it now as a French colony another German one because it was taken over in the war by the French away from the Germany Cameroon was a lot more problematic there was much more fighting there and eventually chose taken over by the French as well as well as parts of heat taken by the British from that from that some were friends I mean from the Germans German East Africa were just talking about was was another prominent site in which another prominent place on the continent in which the war was fought the project was quote-unquote property of Germany but it was eventually taken over by the British who by the way as we'll talk a little bit later were able to do so with the support of tens of thousands of African troops brought over from their colonies in Nigeria and Ghana and Sierra Leone so after that were also very involved in in naturally fighting in these spaces South Africa South Africa and even as a colonial government allied with the British in fighting in German East Africa then as we just mentioned on the previous slide South Africa defeated German forces in German Southwest Africa in 1915 this is what we were talking about when the nama and at the nemedians readily accepted them just based on their hatred for the brutal German forces so you see the war is actually happening in several African paths right also bear in mind that a lot of a lot of the the supplies used in the war not only was it fought on african ground a lot of the supplies using the word come from Africa which included the British claiming Egyptian corn caught on camels labor which were all use in the fight against the Ottoman Empire so so you see that not just the Africans face but African products were used in the first photo as well but most importantly however is this idea of the actual African people who fought in the war okay there are actual African people who fought in the war for example we see here that more than 1 million porters were recruited from Kenya and Tanzania to fight on behalf of the British the porters are baggage handlers and other people will carry staff for fall for the militants 1 million right returned with hundreds at least 100,000 of them at least a tenth of them died from disease malnutrition overwork 50,000 West Africans were brought in as I explained earlier from Ghana Nigeria Sierra Leone this British colonies in West Africa to fight in German East Africa I mean to fighting yeah so 50,000 West Africans 14 in East Africa 600,000 francophone Africans were brought in to fight as well with 150,000 of them actually serving in the trenches in Europe on the European Western Front and 30,000 of them were killed as a result of that and further 40,000 African troops were killed fighting for France in the Mediterranean so again these are stock numbers right then you see that this wasn't a my nitro friend at the war this was a major improvement the French also at hundred forty thousand laborers from North Africa who served the war so again if you're doing the math we are probably after a few million Africans were involved in this so these are some of the prominent ways in which Africa was was I was involved in the world and this picture here is from you know my home country as in Bob with other time Rhodesia and this is a Rhodesian regiment right here right this is the Rhodesian regiment marching to Salisbury which is the capital had added a powerful East Africa during the first world war so these were also troops recruited from Rhodesia that went on to fight in in in East Africa also this one I mentioned this year I you know this is a very interesting anecdote through which South Africa recruited so many troops to fight on their behalf right from from from from South Africa whoa they recruited them true to join the forces to fight against the Germans however they would not allow the African people to carry rifles you know why because they believed that it would set a bad precedent if this African people started shooting at white people so it doesn't matter that the white people that they were shooting at with the South African governments enemies it just wouldn't be right for black people to sue that Europeans because they felt that not only emboldened their resolve and they'll come back and do the same thing back in South Africa and the same mentality was used as well with when the British people and and other people conscripted people to fight in Europe a lot of them were not actually allowed to the front line so they were reluctant to put them on the front lines I mean to put them in positions where they have where they are armed because they do not want to get into their head that you could shoot at the white man or for fear settings so what are the First World War consequences on Africa the first one a very important one is the removal the invincibility myth now of course we've seen that they've been some successful battles here and there we saw the angles Zulu War we saw some of the early resistances some of the winds by the facility vote but of course they are not been sustained so based on their military might and and technological advancement the Europeans were looking very unbreachable at this point they're looking very invincible yet all of a sudden Africans are involved in this Wars where they see the Germans defeated right the Italians defeated so austria-hungary Empire defeated and not only do they see it as we just saw millions of the Africans are involved in this so they start to see that you know maybe eventually these Europeans can be defeated and another important consequence of the First World War was prior to to the First World War a lot of the African interior was still rural right we saw that in North Africa for a long time that had been urbanized early we see that in West Africa and the Swahili coast they're big cities but most of the interior was was rural but what we see is a sudden surge in urbanization as you know the the European countries are the colonial governments are started trying to develop ways in which they can move supplies and people up and down you know quickly with some efficiency so they start to invest more in that trying to improve food products and try to improve all these things as well as many of the Africans who came back from fighting in the war in Europe and other places were not keen to just go back to like so they became part of the urban poor for the most part so which led to the growth of this urban areas and the growth of the urban cities another important thing was the Treaty of the south which prayut reott was you know as was one of the concluding things of the world walk was the was the 14-point is outlined by by Woodrow Wilson and his peers and among them was the right to self-determination okay even though they're not really meant for this to include Africans they're educated Africans for example the you know we've spoken about the the ANC of the time the southern African native National Congress of South Africa and others seized on it and started to use it as a as a rallying point for their own independence that if you argue that these European countries must be self-determining and as a sovereign how does that not apply to us right so I mean then of course Germany lost his colonies we already thought about German East Africa became became Tanganyika is a British colony german south-west africa became Namibia you know Togo became a French colony right then of course the League of Nations is established as a result of the First World War and if you appear it becomes the sole member of the League of Nations and this will become important as well as the fed that we go in and we talk about the advent of the Second World War so these are some of the major consequences of the first world war on the continent and of course in all this we cannot downplay the major consequences which are the deaths of tens of hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands of African the loss of life or the destroy was also immense of their africans so that's about the consequence that i did not list here but i don't think it's it's a with something to be taken lightly right so the africans were very much involved in the world war the war war war was fought on African territory the world war was financed and and furnished by African resources and the World War was the first world war was fought significantly by Africans as well so what our key takeaways from today why don't you take ours from the day the first one that uh you know the first thing to remember are the four types of colonialism the four types of colonial rule which are company rule that went through indirect rule and set up colonialism the second thing to think about is who the president that on the Congo Free State one of the main raw material and what led to the decline of King Leopold's mainly extra of the Gold Coast and just think about the ways in which I described that this represented African initiative I think about two prominent anti German colonial anti German colonialism wars you just talked about and importantly in what way is three or four ways with Africans involved in the first world war and name three consequences of the war on Africa that is there for this week thank you so much for joining me if you enjoyed the video like it share it and asked me during the channel subscribe we will be back next week as we talk about more resistance to colonialism in the twentieth century I look forward to seeing you guys soon and stay well", "q3pGSMEpzCY": "I

see it yes yes perfect perfect all right this is working great all right uh well hello everybody i think most of you know me i'm dale skaggs i'm uh director of horticulture here at the dixon and um this is a interesting topic for me um and i just want to sort of have a little disclaimer at the beginning i approach this mainly as a curious gardener i'm certainly no religious scholar i have no training in that but i'm merely trying to understand what plants are being discussed in particular bible stories you know i suspect some are merely metaphorical and it really doesn't matter what the plant species but i think others are deeply rooted in history and uh so this is my attempted understanding there's about 128 species of plants found in the new and old testaments and some of them like the grapevine everybody knows what a grapevine is so there's no problem in understanding what plant they're talking about but there's other much debated species like the rose and the apple and there's a lot of speculation about those and i suspect one reason is the fact that theologians and botanists don't necessarily see the worlds in the same way and biblical scholars are probably not necessarily keen on plants and they're not you know they're not plant folks so um but one thing that i learned doing this is in trying to put these plants into context is there's going to be confusion and hopefully after you view this we'll all be confused and you'll be confused on a higher level so um even the um even the experts disagree i had eight resources and a couple of web-based resources in order to put this presentation together and there was discrepancies all over that so the task of exploring these plants of the bible seems like a pretty simple and straightforward topic but it's as as complicated and splintered as christianity itself if you think about how many versions of the bible exist today there's over a hundred in english alone and how many different forms of christianity there are there's a lot of debate and differing opinions and it's not just limited to plants um so as i mentioned there's about 128 individual species that have been identified referenced in the bible and today i'm going to talk about 31 of them so uh starting with this uh map of the climate you know in the bible rain and drought and all of these uh uh uh weather um famine and hunger you know they uh appear a lot in the bible and uh so i think famine and drought and these things were probably some of the most feared disasters uh probably right there with locust forms i would imagine but um i just wanted to point out that this is a mediterranean climate and to define a mediterranean climate it has two seasons it has a mild rainy winter and a hot dry summer and in the book of genesis they talk of cold and heat summer and winter and uh so that's kind of what you have uh in the lands that are referred to in the bible um the rain varies with latitude and altitude but if you can look it's pretty much where you grow grapes in the world if you where the great vineyards are that's where the mediterranean climates are if you think about it in that way so i'm going to start talking about uh uh the seven species um in the old testament in uh in in um you know they talk about the the um the the the different most of the seven species are mentioned and uh uh they have played an important role in the food uh of the land of israel uh and uh and they play heavily into the traditions of judaism um and references to these foods are found throughout the bible and uh in in deuteronomy talk about a land with wheat and barley vines and fig trees pomegranates olive oil and honey note six of the seven species are mentioned here these were uh important species to uh to israel and that part of the world so um starting with the genesis story genesis 1 12 the earth brought forth vegetation plants yielding seed according to their own kinds and trees bearing fruit in which their seed according to its kind and god saw that it was good so we're going to start talking about the the seven species and we'll go into a little bit more detail because they're mentioned a lot and they're uh they're sort of important um this needs no introduction this is uh obviously the grapes um and uh an important uh uh historically important uh uh fruit that uh obviously uh wine is made from um i mean this goes back to the beginnings of man's history this relationship with this vine and the fruit um that about uh 3 000 years bc uh you know they found uh pips of grapes in northern greece um so it's been cultivated for a very long time um the vinus sylvesterous which means uh a vitus silvestris means uh plant of the woods anytime you see sylvester's it's referring to woodlands so uh that one was dated to southern europe so these were probably species of that wild plant that were cultivated but interestingly enough the vines were actually unknown in ancient israel um and this shows as one of the seven important plants but in ancient times it was not uh uh really known in israel um you know the the uh bible refers to you know sort of the the uh vintage season which was the yearly feast when the grapes were harvested um and so they they became uh their symbolisms for bounty and when grapes aren't bearing it's more about sadness and and desolation uh so it's used a lot as metaphor in the bible um at one point the vine was regarded as national emblem of israel even though it wasn't cultivated in ancient times and as i said it was one of the seven species which the land was blessed um there just an uh a huge number of words in the bible are associated with the care of these plants with planting pruning pruning uh vintage wine production um and uh so it's it's uh throughout the bible uh grapes are very important um in the new testament uh spiritual meanings are attributed to the vine and the most uh significant them is recorded uh in the book of john when jesus identifies himself with a plant he says i am the true fine and the father is the vine dresser every branch in me that bears no fruit he cuts away and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes to make it bear even more so um that's sort of emphasizing the significance of the uh of the grape let's talk a little bit about grapes primarily in in the mid-south uh you can grow some great varieties here they're not the best uh for making wine but you can grow grow grapes here as i said mediterranean climates we have too much heat and humidity there's a lot of mildew and fungal issues and problems with trying to grow grapes here but uh the fig on the other hand although it's borderline hearty if you select the right varieties things do well here um so i found this uh this parable in in the bible in the book of luke and i thought it was very fitting um it could happen today at the dixon um so uh i'm going to read this to you this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none he said to the vine dresser look for three years i have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and i find none cut it down why should it use up the ground well you know a lot of times when there's trees here that are declining at the dixon i'm always uh i'm always thinking you know we can save them we can save them and kevin is very keen on what the grounds look like and often he'll say you know we should probably have that removed so this is like an answer that i would give him it says uh uh annie answered him sir let it alone this year also until i dig around and put put on a manure and then if it shall bear fruit next year well and good but if not you can cut it down so he's giving this tree a second chance and so it's kind of like me saying uh kevin i'm going to get uh adam who works here in the garden to put some of his magic compost tea on it and uh anyway i thought that was a fitting story but figs are very important it's the first fruit to be mentioned in the bible in the story of adam and eve it's been cultivated 5 000 years bc they found remnants of it in archaeological digs um it was also grown in ancient egypt and it was a big part of nutrition in biblical times it has uh they would press it into cakes and store it for the fruitless season kind of like you would a raisin and uh it's among the seven species uh symbolizing the prosperity and peace um it's believed that the one the the wild plant in uh northwest turkey is the ancestor of the fig and um oh sorry got a little ahead of myself all right um like i said it's borderline hearty here but you might try uh if you want to try your hand at growing figs uh brown turkey is a good cultivar hearty chicago is another one that works pretty well there's one called brunswick there's one called uh celeste and um there is also why am i jumping around you're sorry um uh violet d bordeaux is one that we had in the plant sale it's supposed to be one that's good for containers like on a patio or something so uh so all of those are supposed to be among the heartier end of fig trees they uh they like it a little south of us this is zone eight plant all right let's talk about another plant that you can actually grow here this is the pomegranate in the koran pomegranates are mentioned as one of the provisions of allah who sends water down from the sky which we bring forth the buds of every plant from these we bring forth green foliage close growing grain palm trees laid with clusters of dates vineyards olive groves and pomegranates uh in the quran he's mentioning uh there's five of the seven uh uh gifts from from god that are mentioned in the quran uh that were so celebrated that we're talking about now in judaism so um it wasn't unique to judaism as well um you know drink a drink is made from pomegranate and even today we sort of celebrate the health benefits of pomegranate how many of you have had a palm uh drink that's uh has pomegranate juice in it and uh the juice contains uh uh a chemical that's being investigated to be beneficial in cancer research so um the uh it's also used in ink and in in um in tanning uh uh clothing and as a dye plant um although uh it's numbered among the seven species for which the uh land has been blessed it was not as big of a part of the staple diet uh during biblical times like the the date or the fig um like i said it was used for both food and art um they they come in several places in the scriptures most notably um uh the solomon's temple as a garland on the pillars of the temple it's uh supposedly had 200 pomegranates engraved on the capitals of the two pillars which were at the front of the temple so uh a significant plant no doubt another uh a plant that was hugely significant is the date palm and it's one of the region's most ancient fruit trees it's a tree of desert oasis and uh cultivated about uh four thousand uh bc um the palm trees and the leaves were used uh in king solomon's temple engravings uh the maccabees used the palm as an emblem on their coin and roman coins depicted a woman seated under a palm as well so um significance uh illustrated there the plant is common in many gardens even today and often people will take the seeds from commercial dates and plant them and grow them in their garden apart from the palm having a spiritual role in its spiritual image imagery through the bible it had many practical uses the fruit is sustaining and it's still a mainstay for uh tribes in arabia and africa um you can get juice from the trunk a tasty juice can be made the leaves were woven into baskets uh the wood was used for fences roofs and wraps so it's a very very useful plant one of the seven blessings on the land and here's the fruit here it's grown commercially uh for fruit in the united states in texas arizona and california and uh the high sugar content like the fig makes it great for drying and storing so having fruit off season without refrigeration is is a big deal probably second to the great is the olive tree uh in a number of times that it's mentioned in the bible it was very very significant it grew among the rocks on rocky stoney soils and uh they're scattered on the mountain slopes of galilee today um um the olive was one of the seven species of the land it abounded in biblical days both in the mountains and in the coastal plains um interestingly enough the olive leaf symbolizes peace and uh ever since the history of mankind extending the olive branch you may have heard um anyway um the tree was immensely popular because of its fruit and apart from the daily diet the oil was used as an ointment uh you know when you anoint heads with oil or for anointing the sick they also uh used it for a light source for burning lights the oil was used to to light oil lamps and it was used as a solvent of various spices and incense and uh perfumes and cosmetics uh the wood was very very nice it's richly grained and dense and it's great for household utensils and uh interestingly enough at the foot of the uh mount of olives where oil presses uh there were oil presses located there and uh the site was called yosemite and yosemite means oil press so the garden of gethsemane was obviously a garden of olive garden uh of oil presses uh it grows all over the mediterranean wild and in israel um olive pits have been found at various excavation sites so it's it's definitely historically and still is today as important uh crop it's a zone nine plant for us you really can't grow we plant them here at the dixon and grown them in containers and they're really attractive we don't ever get any fruit on them it's kind of a zone nine plant i guess it probably below 25 degrees is going to kill it out right but there are some cultivars that are hardier than others and doing a little research there's one called arbequina there's arbosana and uh poraniki those are among the toughest varieties if you wanted to try your hand at growing an altru but you're gonna have to bring it in indoors and here's the beautiful fruits all right there's two grains that are mentioned this is seven species um it grew what this grain is wheat and it grew wild in the fertile crescent in mesopotamia where uh where life uh began uh most scientists degree um early wild wheat would shatter so they started selecting this is the first time that people are actually uh selecting plants for cultivation that we know of that's documented so early wheat would shatter so that so they started selecting grains that wouldn't shatter so that they could actually harvest them so they wouldn't fall to the ground um it has a higher protein than most other grains today there's over 3 000 cultivars of wheat that exist today and they're all derived from 14 different species it's by far the most traded grain in the world and this is the other grain that is that is mentioned and uh apparently the translation from hebrew uh means uh long hair and refers to the long hairs on the head of grain this again is one of the seven species which the land was blessed it's always been kind of considered inferior to wheat it was kind of the poor people's bread you made barley made the poor people's bread it was limited to areas with not much rainfall um so but it's been cultivated longer than wheat um about 8 000 years uh bc um it's cultivated uh today as you know most a lot of it's used barley you feed the livestock um it's but it's always been a staple food among the poor working men and uh when people were in these sort of famines or things they would actually eat eat a lot of barley um i happen to like barley because you make beer out of barley um and the legend is is that in egypt uh osiris taught the egyptians how to make beer um there's two forms that they make beer with one is two row malt which means there's two rows of these kernels and six row has six six rows of the kernels and uh historically today most ales are made out of two row and most loggers are made out of six row but in order to use it they malt it and the malting process they basically spread the grain out over a floor or a surface they moisten it and they let it sprout and germinate and this releases enzymes that actually convert the sugars to from i mean the starches in the grain to fermentable sugars so and the more they roast it to stop that sprouting process the darker the grain gets and that's how you get darker colored malts it's by more roasting but that's the that's the process at least in england how they have done malt for uh for both whiskeys and um and for uh for beer all right so that covers the seven uh gifts of the land uh that were important to uh they're noted as being important to judaism but they also uh as i pointed out the koran and just for sustaining life in general these were important plants um there's a lot of confusion on plants and there's a lot of of things that uh uh are legends and stories that you really can't uh you really can't validate through the bible um and so i put this plant on here this is a plant that's native to the new world this is the passion vine or passiflora this particular one is the maypop native to shelby county this is paso flora incarnata and the reason that i have this up is because um uh jesuit missionaries uh were converting indigenous peoples to this species of passion power all through the america the americas uh this just happens to be the one made in shelby county but uh jesuit missionaries would convert indigenous peoples to catholicism and they like to use props and so this made such a great prop because there were so many metaphors here the purple color was remindful of the color of lint it had a central pillar to the center there's three stigmas that symbolize the three nails that were used for the crucifixion uh the five anthers were supposedly the five wounds that christ sustained um there's references to a crown of thorn in here um anyway they even say the leaves look like the spears that that uh pierced his side so there was a lot of storytelling that you could do with this in fact there were pamphlets made to teach uh missionaries how to how to use this as a tool to convert more earth-based religions to christianity so i suspect the reason that i have this in here not because it's a plan of the holy land but i suspect just like this a lot of plants uh legends and things were created uh surrounding plants to uh for this purpose so i always grew up hearing that a dogwood tree uh was basically uh what the cross was made of that christ was crucified on um the real story is a little bit uh uh uh it's actually just a legend the story the bible nowhere tells us the story of the type of wood that the cross was used for you know romans made a lot of uh a lot of crosses and it doesn't say there's no history on how the crosses were made or if there was a preferential type of wood um so this is a legend that it was made of dogwood it's you know longwoods don't get big enough really to to be a a cross but there's a legend so nobody knows who wrote this but there's a legend that has circulated that i you know i learned uh growing up with dogwood trees and uh uh so anyway but uh this is kind of a little bit debunking the myth but if you'll bear with me i'm going to read this it's fairly short but uh it uh it says in jesus time the dog would grew to a stately size and lovely hue to a strong and firm its branches interwoven for the cross of christ its timbers were chosen seeing the distress at the use of their wood christ made a promise which still holds good never again shall the dogwood grow large enough to be used so slender and twisted it shall be with blossoms like a cross for all to see as blood stains the petals marked in brown the blossom sinner were a thorny crown all who see it will remember me crucified on a cross from the dogwood tree cherished and protected the tree shall be a reminder of all my agony again this is a nice poem but there's no biblical basis to it and they appear to be covering their tracks and the fact that a dogwood tree doesn't grow big enough to make timbers uh by saying you know that this is sort of a curse that was put on it uh but the other real fact is i'm gonna go back the other real fact is is that uh there's no species of dogwood that would have been native to the holy land for them to use so again this is uh uh this is a legend uh uh that was probably used uh to for evangelical purposes all right a plant that is hotly contested in the in in the bible is the uh the apple and it's obviously it you know the apple is a suit assumed to be the original sin in in genesis and the adam and eve story um but the cool temperatures that required uh growth of an apple were probably not there and uh the constant arid conditions uh you would need irrigation to grow um to grow apples in the land of the bible so um scholars suggest that the apple of the scriptures was really either an apricot which is here or possibly a quince or maybe even the pomegranate but uh it was uh definitely another fruit tree other than the apple but again there it's it's uh there's a lot of controversy over this um anyway the the botanists think that it was probably an apricot this is the apple here um ancient egypt had uh had some apples so um and pliny the elder refers to to apples so um and there's some that grow wild in turkey so you know there's still some some confusion on whether the apple was actually an apple or an apricot um and some have suggested that it was this plant which is a cydonia which is uh it's called quince which is a common name that uh most people know the flowering quince here is a multi-stem shrub this is a tree called cydonia which is the quince and it has enormous fruit and uh the cydonia along is a good chance that it would have tolerated the conditions and it looks very much like an apple uh but it doesn't turn red it's yellow and beautiful flowers on that i actually uh pulled this off the web but beautiful flowers on the sidonia all right how about the burning bush moses and the burning bush um you know i know as a horticulturalist uh we often use latin names and i think a lot of people think we're just kind of being snobbish or arrogant to use these latin names but i just want to point out that it's really essential to avoid confusion with the common names if we had the latin names and carl limaeus system in the bible we would know exactly what plants we were talking about but common names only confuse even in modern times the burning bush the plant that we call burning bush is euronymous elatus are winged euonymus and it's called burning bush because it really lights up with the fall color but the actual burning bush in the bible is thought to be a rubus which rubus is the genus of blackberries and uh loganberries and raspberries they're all rubus and so this is a wild rubist that uh would have been growing in israel and all over the uh the lands of the bible so they think that this was the actual burning bush excuse me all right let's talk about uh certain question it's um it's kin to our redbud tree and it's referred to as the judas tree and um you know the origin of the common name is contentious some people say judas tree is a corruption of judean um and then others say it was the tree from which judaism hung himself so uh but notice it even has a heart-shaped leaf much like the uh heart-shaped leaf of our red bud and the flowers are very similar but this is the uh the uh lands of the bible this would be a native tree here's the fruit on it very similar to ours the cilanquestrum is a latin term that refers to the shape of that fruit and then here is our dogwood tree if you look at the upper right hand corner you can see it's pre it's distribution is all over the southeastern united states but it it too has a heart-shaped leaf it has the fruit there are numerous cultivars out it is a great garden plant for us the bark is nice it gets to be a pretty good sized tree so um there you have it there's uh one in bloom over at the memphis botanic gardens that i took years ago it's actually a legume in the pea family as you can see by the blossoms at all the trees in the bible the cedar tree is mentioned uh probably more than any and it was an important construction material like cypress and redwood it has a natural tendency to resist decay it makes it very desirable as a building material and uh cedar was widespread and there were a lot of cedars grown but it was continually harvested it was used for construction of houses of and household items um you know the fabled cedars of lebanon they're um sadly i think most of the cedars of lebanon are not there anymore but uh there are some the original i think there's a few allez and a few groves that have been preserved uh uh in spite of their i think it's even on the flag the lebanese flag but uh um it's uh throughout the bible it's mentioned this this cedar um the cedar of lebanon i think there's only one lonely grove um because it was overused but cedar of lebanon has expanded around the globe where it's used as a forestry tree and there's extensive force of cedar lavonniere in turkey native stands of it um king solomon's temple was built of cedris laboniai and in egypt some of the royal temples are also reported to have used cedar in their construction um there's references uh uh of people flourishing like a palm tree and growing like a cedar in lebanon but notice the cedar tree all the cones are held upright the cones shatter before they come off the plant so you won't find a cone on the ground you'll only find pieces of a cone and there are only four true cedars in the world they grow from lebanon to syria to the himalayan mountains and the island of cyprus the so-called red cedar of the pacific northwest the incense cedar in california and what we call cedar here in west tennessee they're not true cedars at all one is a juniper one is uh uh uh chemist cyprus and uh anyway they're not cedars at all they're not true seeders so again that's where the latin name sorted out whenever you see the name cedric you know you're dealing with a force with one of the four true seeders of the world um cedars are more closely related to pines and they have these dense clusters of needles a lot for originating from these pegs on the branches uh anyway the um they're drought tolerant and they can get 120 150 feet old um cedric's atlantica the center ceiling of lebanon is not that great for us but the sea centers atlantica grows pretty well here in memphis it's called the atlas cedar it's from the atlas mountains of algeria and morocco it has inch inch long needles that are a wonderful blue gray green and the cultivar glauca is a really a widely cultivated ornamental and there are a lot of other cultivars with uh pendulous or weeping habits and uh i'll show you a cultivar here in a minute uh number three of the cedars remember there's four this is number three this is from the himalayan mountains in afghanistan this is the diadera cedar and uh it can get 200 feet tall it's widely planted you could always tell a viadora because the top is sort of droopy and the branches sort of droop downward and sweep downwards um it's got the longest needles i say longest needles they're only a couple of inches but they're longer than the other cedar species and we can grow centers theodore here there's good examples in memphis the thing is you just don't need to over irrigate them and then this is an obscure one this is cedar number four cedrus brevifolia it only grows on the island of cyprus uh i've never grown this it has the shortest of all needles like a quarter of an inch to a little bit over a half inch along and if you go to the great lawn of in san francisco there's a great lawn at the san francisco botanical gardens and they grow all four of these species side by side but again only the deodera and the blue atlas grow well here this is a blue atlas cedar in the parking lot island un-irrigated at the dixon and this is a dwarf cultivar that we really love called horsemen look at the blue green needles on it it's growing there with a hearty agave as well that's been in the ground outdoors unprotected for many many years all right let's talk about the laureless nobleus most of you probably know this as the bay leaf you use in cooking if you do stock you end up adding bay leaves and it provides some of the aroma and uh and taste that you get from from cooking and mediterranean and other dishes um it was esteemed by by the greeks um and uh it's a forest tree um it was used to crown winters in ancient games it's kind of a a plant tiara they would make out of this they would make a wreath that you put on your head so um loreless noble it's the term baccalaureate means laurel berries and it's the ancient symbol of victory and of course it's used with uh with uh univ the universe university and education today um this plant grows uh in israel in uh the oak forest there's a an oak forest uh complex in israel that's native and uh it's part of that uh the laurel is also a messenger of peace uh in so much like the uh um uh uh hold like the olive branch holding out a branch of laurel is a symbol of truce um so anyway so that is the laurel that's mentioned in the bible uh it's uh mentioned as a bay as well uh not as a law as a bay but uh it is a laurel couldn't have a a talk about plants of the bible without boxed wood um this is the box tree uh boxes longaflora is this is simper of irons here but bucks this long of course probably the one that was native to the uh to the land of the bible um it's you know a hearty evergreen tree um it's uh bucks a super virus actually goes into part of lebanon um it's evergreen so that was neat and it's one of the earliest cultivated plants by uh pliny the elder uh uh had uh had mentioned uh a boxwood is one of the earliest cultivated ornamentals in the bible it refers to it as ashar wood and ashar is the box tree uh and um it's called uh boxwood because it's used it's a very hard dense wood uh that was used in carving and making little boxes and uh this little medallion here is indicative of using the boxwood for that ashar tree um some have even speculated that uh uh you know that maybe the boxwood was the what the timbers that christ was crucified on were but i suspect you know i said the longer floria would that would have been the species that was uh found there and it's a rather smaller shrub at least by today's standards but in that indoor this is why they call it boxwood uh because they would make box boxes to keep their valuable spices and herbs and things in this is bux's longiflora and it only gets to be about three feet tall so it's unlikely that the cross was made of that but we will probably never know here's a plant that's mentioned in the bible in sort of the boggy areas and in the wetlands and in the uh um on riverbanks on stony riverbanks and it's uh it's naturalized down in florida in the united states uh it's a poisonous plant called oleander um it was used in medicine it's an evergreen shrub um and it's mentioned in the bible as well another plant of sort of the lowlands and the swamp lands would be the cattail and uh it's a marsh and water plant it was uh referred to as reed mace uh in the bible and i think this is probably what most the baby moses was hidden in it's sometimes referred to as bull rush and today it's even a dominant feature in the ditches and tributaries of the nile and lower egypt and uh just as the descriptions were in exodus and isaiah a really interesting uh a plant that we're all familiar with that other species drove here natively so um another wetland plant that we all know is the uh sweet flag uh sweet flag was an ingredient in uh in a holy anointing oil um the stalk is dried and reduced to a powder that was used in perfumes and in ointments that you would mix with oils and anoint people's head because it has a sweet smell to it it's sweet black grass is what we know it as it's a chorus is the genus and variegated sweet flag grass is a great ornamental in memphis it works well and it's uh almost evergreen in most winters and there's a really attractive plant and then there's a yellow form called ogon which is yellow form that we also like to use but that's sweet flag grass in in matthew there is a reference to um in matthew there's a reference to the lilies of the field and it talks about the different colors of the lilies of the field if you think about the harsh environment uh that you're looking at bulbs are well suited to a harsh environment some of the wild tulips are there crocus um cilla and some other uh uh uh high soy hispanica some other uh plants that that would grow there in the wild in their wild form and so that's probably what's being referred to um along the roadsides the flowers of the field lilies are mentioned numerous times i think somewhere i read like 15 times in the bible and they occur in the song of solomon quite a bit and uh um but there's some debate over whether lillian candida would be the lily of the field based on geography location and natural distribution of the plant most likely the lily of the field was an anemone or a wind flower that blooms in the spring uh anemone coronaria and uh they're called wind flowers because the seed pods dry and they're distributed in the wind but this was probably the lily of the field it's what scholars suggest uh another plant that's confused among the scholars is the rose certainly there were species of rosaceae and rose that grew in the holy lands they would have been much like this probably a single wild rose uh but uh in in researching it most consensus is is that uh the rose that's referred to in the bible is not a rose at all but a narcissus so it's more like our daffodil and this is narcissus to zetta and if you've ever bought paper whites they're in the group tazetta so uh they don't need chilling they're um uh narcissists that don't need the chilling in order to flower and so that was probably the rose of the bible that sort of consensus uh from several sources is that narcissus to zetta was the rose as mentioned in the bible i mentioned bulbs being tough one bulb that was native to the to the holy lands that's mentioned it's called star of bethlehem uh it's uh ornitha galem and if you know anything about latin ortho means bird and galem means dung so the common name is dove's dung uh most botanists accept the interpretation that the star in bethlehem is most likely the dubs dung as in the second uh uh in in uh second uh kings uh it's mentioned and that's what they assumed the plant was um i think it gets the name because if you can imagine a rock filled hill with this growing it looks like the rocks are are coated with uh with uh dung dropped by doves and other birds which would have been a good source uh for fertilizer a natural fertilizer much like the dove coats they used in england to uh to harvest the manure to use in their gardens all right so let's move on to some herbs drugs and spices including some of the incense aromatic herbs have played a hugely influential role in health and and healing and they're part of the lifestyle in biblical times and uh just the pursuit and trade of these alone changed the existence of nations there were routes made for portraying spices um and uh a lot of these were used uh to make incense perfumes or you know ointments and things uh the first one i'm gonna mention is crocus sativas uh crocus was used uh this is the crocus bulb that you're familiar with it's a cult it's a species of that uh this is uh a tiny plant uh with a little subterranean bulb or actually technically a corn and um it's flowers are used for spice they're also used as a dye plant for coloring and they thought that they had healing purposes throughout the bible uh so this is crocus sativa so if you look at those little anthers in there and stigmas those are harvested by hand and this is used for the dye and beverages they're difficult to gather 150 flowers produces only a single gram of saffron so this is a labor-intensive thing but uh a little pinch of that in your rice will make it yellow so this is the saffron so anyway um moving on to gall that is mentioned throughout the bible both in the old and new testament gaul is actually poison hemlock another reason why we look at the latin names um poison hemlock is not poisoned from the hemlock tree that you see on the left of your screen uh that grows here at the dixon and grows native to tennessee in the eastern part of the state that is not the hemlock at all um connie immaculatum is the hemlock and so it's the toxin that socrates ingested that took his life uh the poison is especially abundant in the fruit this plant naturally grows in greece and um it was um it was thought that uh uh gaul was mentioned uh in uh the uh liquid that uh was given the cross to christ on the cross so it may have some other properties as well um all right so one of the gifts from the wise men was frankincense and frankincense the name means uh uh uh the true sense are true uh incense and so that's what it means boswellia carterei um the resin from several species there's 24 species and the the rosin or the resin from these was uh traded throughout the ancient world um it was part of the famous spice route uh from arabia and east africa um incense this is uh the plan incense is uh is this aromatic smoke and people thought that incense would connect the sort of the the here the present world with the with the heavens because the incense uh made us made this smoke that was a link between gods and and people um so um there's archaeological evidence that this was used uh you know in 200 bc um as i said the word means uh in frankincense means true incense um at its heyday uh around 300 bc they said that 3 000 tons of frankincense each year was exported um today there's only a few hundred tons of frankincense produced in the world so it's not as important today but it was a key ingredient in a lot of uh of incense another one of the uh uh uh gifts of the wise men was myrrh and um this uh it was the most precious of all the resins and the dried resins of several species of the genus homophora these shrubs are these are shrubs or small trees of the region and not all species are used for the same purpose some are used for medicine other use for fragrances it's been touted for a long time with its healing quality yes honey sorry i'm listening to something okay somebody used to mute um the scented myrrh um you know solomon's writings has references throughout um and it was used as a perfume as well the egyptians burned it as incense also in their temples um uh myrrh was one of the ingredients uh offered in the vinegar when jesus was on the cross and so uh it was offered vinegar mingled with myrrh and so there may be some uh uh opiate to like qualities or sort of pain relieving qualities that uh maybe that's why it was given to uh to christ on the cross um so anyway that's that's myrrh so moving from the gifts of the wise men to a um to a very curious plant that has been steeped in lore tradition and uh uh it's uh uh the mandrake and uh um it's uh in the bible it's mentioned growing along the fields this is in the nightshade family it's kind to potatoes and tomatoes and it's why potatoes and tomatoes were discovered in the new world at first they weren't accepted in the old world because they were related to this plant which is uh known to be toxic and possibly hallucinogenic and has a lot of uh it's even associated with witchcraft and a lot of things so um anyway it really doesn't have a stem it's just these basil rosettes and it has these flowers that emerge um the fruits are supposed to contain a lot of the narcotic like qualities here's the fruits they're noted in the song of songs and they're produced in early summer and apparently they smell really good the fruit does it's common in greece and they say historically it was uh valued for its aphrodisiac powers especially when you soak it in wine in fact they called it love apple and they believed it would help a barren woman to conceive but interestingly enough in in the uh the uh arabians thought the it was uh uh evil plant they called it devil's candle and um and um it was also satan's fruit satan's apple was another name um in the middle ages in europe it was just steeped in lore and tradition in the middle ages there was a thing called doctrine of signatures and this was the commonly held belief that if a plant looked like a body part it must be medicine given to us by god for that body part so this root looks like a human and it's a long dark root that may be several feet deep and it can weigh several pounds it has a human-like shape and that just aided in its spread of superstition in fact it was said that if you pulled this plant up from the ground that it would let out a shrill so loud that it would kill you so they people employed dogs to pull these roots up um recent experiments show that bandrag may contain sedatives and aphrodisiacs but it's mixed in with all these toxins so it is a toxic plant um but uh perhaps soaking it in the wine made more of an effort easy in the bottom corner there that's a reference from harry potter where it's associated with the witchcraft but this is the the mandrake route that's mentioned in the bible so interestingly enough it's uh it's associated with witchcraft and it's also associated with which witches flying so i guess if they were hallucinating maybe they were flying i don't know um here's a plant that's mentioned in the old testament and the new testament um it's aloe this is the aloe we know but actually the aloe in the old testament is aquilaria aquilaria which is another genus altogether uh and uh they derived a perfume from the bark um it's listed as uh as with myrrh and some of these other things that spices and they were in great demand for their fragrance and oil it's mentioned in numbers and proverbs and in psalms and this is the tree that that actually the trunk of the tree that the bark is derived from growing next to a bamboo here um aqualaria but in the new testament aloe vera is the aloe vera we know um has the sword like leaves and uh it's uh used in medicine we use this to treat burns it's been used for burns for since since uh people started cultivating the plant it was also used for embalming the dead and as a perfume for shrouds um it's also used for constipation um as historically so uh this is uh another plant that's mentioned in the bible is capers the caper bush and uh it comes from the hebrew word desire and uh so when you see the word desire uh it's referring to caper bush um it's very common uh and seeds around in rocks and stuff it's a beautiful plant but capers are only mentioned one time that i could find in the bible so um anyway look at that beautiful flower when we were on our dixon uh trip to italy uh we were uh touring at a place outside of tuscany on the hillside this was growing there's the fruit of the caper bush uh it grows on the wailing wall in jerusalem out of the rocks uh the flowers bloom in mid-summer and what they open in the evening and the next morning it wilts and then from that uh come these uh berries that you see here and then they split open and expose the seeds and any of you who have had locks are familiar with capers i love capers they're yummy i used to think they were the flower buds but i think they may actually be the seeds i used to think we were eating flower buds by the shape of them so anyway that is the story of capers moving from capers i've got this is the last plant that i have and like the capers there's only one reference to this plant in the bible which is surprising because this would have been a common plant and is still common over many parts of the middle east found in the mountains as well as long as rivers and streams and i put it in here because from a horticultural standpoint we love styrex we planted several of them at the dixon there used to be a styrax la here at the dixon and they're wonderful uh mayflowering plants with these pendulous flowers but styrax actually has a gummy resin in the sap that was very coveted uh in hosea it's mentioned uh that's the only mentioned it's thyrox in the bible it's uh it's referred to poplar in this verse but um looking at the poplar and the white poplar that could have been uh attributed to that scholars say that it was most likely styrac's that this is referring to here's styrex of this analysis but it occurs one time in the bible but uh it's certainly a significant ornamental plant there's the fruit on the styrex and i it's my understanding a resin uh a gummy rubbery resin is extracted uh that's uh very useful uh for uh incense perfumes and other things as well so that's styrax officinalis and there's the wonderful pendulous flowers on the styrax of the creamy white flowers so this was actually mixed with frankincense and other herbs to uh burn in the tabernacle it was a tabernacle instance of the old testament so it's been around and utilized for a long time beautiful tree so that is my uh plants of the bible and thank you for for bearing with me i hope that wasn't too long um again i'm not a biblical scholar nor do i claim to be and uh i was just trying to merely understand what plants they were talking about and one thing's for sure is there is a lot of confusion so i hope i left you with some understanding and i'm sure i introduced some confusion on your part as well but hopefully you're like me and confused on a higher level and with that i would love to answer questions maybe lindley would be willing to read the questions to me yes thank you that was amazing you uh always impress us with uh the amount of knowledge that you uh that you have about all of these plants from all over the world well i will start first by telling you uh by referring back to you talking about you and kevin not always agreeing about whether a tree needs to come out or not so uh kevin says dale's first miracle will be bringing a dead tree back to life hasn't happened yet but hope springs eternal a little message from kevin sharp to kevin's point you know kevin wants the grounds to look really nice all the time and i i like i said hope springs eternal and there's been usually i must say uh we will uh step up to these trees we'll give them some love i'll call dr mark foles he'll come and inject them with different things to try to save them and a lot of times by the time the plant is under that much stress we end up losing some of them and have to cut them down anyway but it's sort of a ritual we go through so but i thought that was so funny that when i read that it just resonated with me because it's sort of what we go through and i started thinking about adam with all his compost and compost teas so anyway thanks kevin well um you talked a lot about olives of course because olives are mentioned so much in the bible and um so i've heard that processing olives to make them edible at all is a difficult uh process so do you know anything about that i do not i do not know anything about processing olives i know that uh most of the olives that uh um that are consumed in in biblical lands are much different from the olives that we have stuffed with pimentos here so uh but um i know they have a pit on them and i'm not sure what goes into processing odds that maybe there's some kind of pickling or curing process but but i'm not exactly sure okay and you mentioned um the big quince fruits and i think a lot of us are used to the quince bushes we have here that do have the small fruits on them so um are the big quince fruits good to eat you know the the small quits fruit that is usually a multi-stem thorny plant uh that's kind of a it catches all the garbage that blows around your yard because nobody wants to reach in there and grab the garbage out because of the thorns you know that has a fruit on it and it's it's they're all related they're all uh uh uh related uh fruits whether it's the quince even the apple um but that's uh anomalies and there's several species of that and that is edible the cydonia is also edible and my only experience with it is uh as a teenager working at 45's nursery mr castle had a grove of them and they were growing in pots and they had rooted into the ground so the pots were removed and there was a little grove of them and they had really attractive bark they did have spines but the fruit was extremely large bigger than a grapefruit and um so i think at one time some were collected and uh i saw someone who uh an old friend on the uh on this attending this lecture who i think took some of the seed and grew them when she worked for barbara taylor who was a local local gardener here so that's the cydonia and so yes to answer your question they are uh they are edible okay and i know that uh we had oleander growing in the cutting gardens for a while um is that just because we you know take them in and out or will oleander grow here oleander is not hardy out of doors here it is like some more tropical climate um i think you start to see it at the at the along the gulf coast uh it grows in lower alabama florida panhandle and south of there um you know there's signs on the road talking about the toxicity of it and that sort of thing it's a beautiful plant but it's not hardy here we have planted them in the ground and let them get big in the what we call the bed beds here at the dixon but it is not a uh it is not a cold hardy plant for us it's evergreen okay well uh susie and michael baker once you know uh do you know what gopher wood is which is what noah's ark was made of i did not find any reference to gopher wood but i i would like i'm going to add that to my talk i will research gopher wood you know probably uh you know it seems like an arc cedar would make a great and it was abundant and plentiful it seems like cedar would make a and and i think somewhere in the scripture there's uh um a reference to the size of the wood and i guess that's where the gopher wood reference is i'll have to go back and research that you know this topic is so uh fascinating and i have just barely scratched the surface of it but but i would like to know what gopher wood is or if there's a scholarly view on what that might be well kathy johnson wants to know um something that i want to know too so thanks for asking it are capers eaten straight from the pod or must they be treated first do you know that again that's like the olive i don't i do not know i've never eaten any you know the only time i know that uh uh when i was in italy was the first time i'd actually seen uh caper plants growing wild and uh uh it was on a hillside and uh uh they were in flower and i knew immediately what it was but like i said i don't have that much experience with it it's not something that we would grow here so okay well kathy james says something i obviously don't know enough to know to know about this uh she says i noticed that you avoided problems of rose of sharon and baum of gilead yeah though there's a lot that's a rabbit hole i didn't go down yes that's very much so um so the rose of sharon that we call today is not the rose of sharon of the bible so uh there's debate over it anyway so uh but i didn't go down that that's uh that's even more complicated than the apple so anyway yes so is that um is rose of sharon and baum of gilead uh con are they confused with each other or what's the problem i don't know about balm of gilead i don't know but i do know that rose of sharon is mentioned numerous times in the bible and uh and there's uh there's a little bit of debate over that plan as well so i did not go down that there were a lot of a lot of things that actually if i were to continue clicking on my slide presentation i've got about 25 more slides one of which is the rows of sharon but i omitted them because you know i i just didn't have the time to uh to uh dive into them and maybe it was a little bit more obscure or not as easily accessible to the information well the last thing we have in our chat is not a question but it's julie peratti saying thank you dale this was great and uh i echo that that's cheerleader julie is always upbeat and positive you gotta love julie for that it is true it is true so um so i'm gonna say now we're gonna sort of close things out so if anybody wants to unmute and real quickly say thank you to dale you're welcome to do it thanks dale it was very informative thank you thank you

okay item six fiscal year 2017 2018 community art support grant allocation good morning wording vice mayor members of the subcommittee commenting that we have a new guest we do and I will tell you about here in just a second so we come to you today to share the arts and culture commission's recommendations for the 2017-18 Community Arts grant support program these recommendations include 63 grants to 54 organizations totaling eight hundred and sixty-five thousand three hundred and forty six dollars these are general fund appropriations and the total does not include I want to point out does not include the additional $20,000 in grant funding for youth oriented programs approved by council as part of the fiscal year 2018 budget nor does it include the new neighborhood arts grants which are funded by the National Endowment for the Arts will return in the early fall to update you on these grants so with me today are at the end here Dwight Walt who runs the grants program for the office of Arts and Culture now Ashley here who partners with Dwight on this on this project is out of town and so we've asked arts and culture commissioner Laura Wilde who sits on Ashley's arts learning committee to join us today she's executive director of Chico and also want to point out today in the audience is our commission chair to niqua Braaten and Commissioner Michael olesco so we're going to start the presentation with Laura thank you prior to the March 30 deadline staff held grant orientation throughout the city for first-time applicants locations included toyo library South Mountain library Libyan Education Center Maryvale Community Center and Ironwood library in the second year of these citywide orientations we saw the attendance almost double 27 attendees last year and 41 this year we held grant panels from the end of April to early May 28 citizen volunteers served as grant review panelists including a wide range of artists educators nonprofit professionals and community representatives as you can see on the slide we offer assistance to nonprofit organizations and six different categories general operations rental support and project specific grants festivals and art learning partnerships so this slide shows our 2017 2018 recommendation as Gail said includes a seven hundred and forty thousand three hundred and forty six dollar appropriation from the general fund another hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars comes from the Phoenix Convention Center to help fund the rental support program for a total of eight hundred and sixty-five thousand three forty six this budget snapshot shows the general fund appropriation going back to 1991 the big dip in 2010 to 2014 is the greatest recession of course and you can see that since then council has restored funding back to the pre-recession level of support and on behalf of the arts and cultural community of organizations thank you funding for the general operating support level one in two categories is meant to sustain a community of responsibly governed organizations in rich arts and cultural literacy for our residents by requiring education and outreach programs and encourage diversity of programming that will engage community-wide participation the images here from top to bottom are black theater troupe and their black nativity production Chico Laura's organization and Rosie's house general operating support one is the category of support for Phoenix's largest and largest arts and culture anchor organizations the criteria that the panel considered in ranking the applications included their artistic value the mission what they provide in programming their public value what they're doing in education and outreach services their financial position as we review their audited and financial their audited financial statements their diversity initiatives the diversity of their board the diversity of their audience and programming and governance what is the structure of their of their board of directors the panel's ranking of the criteria determined the allocation recommendation the public value criterion asks applicants about their efforts to broaden deepen and diversify their services to Phoenix residents through education and community outreach programs most all of our general operating support one organizations offer free admission days hours or they target title one schools for out Beach a few highlights of other public value services include Ballet Arizona which offers a depth of dance programs for people with Parkinson's disease and they also offer a Down Syndrome adaptive dance program the Phoenix Art Museum is developing and expanding bilingual signage and creating a bilingual website they also have launched a teen Council that develops programming for teens the Phoenix Symphony offers a steam program called mind over music for schools and this year they launched concerts at homeless shelters the Phoenix Symphony is also nationally recognized for an Alzheimer's program that serves patients caregivers and staff with Banner Hospital general operating support to is the same in all respects but serves the mid-sized arts and cultural anchor organizations with budgets starting at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars this is our fastest growing category of support in fiscal year 14 we have a total of seven organizations in the category today we have sixteen organizations Chico rosin house jazzed in ads also known as the Nash and Arizona Jewish Historical Society are examples of organizations that have been added since 2014 examples of public value programming from this group include Valley Youth Theatre they have a long-standing literacy in the arts program with Phoenix elementary and Roosevelt school districts they also participate in a ticketing program that serves veterans called vet ticks black theatre troupes building on 12th and Washington now four years old has become a deeply embedded resource for the East Lake Park community hosting community gatherings and meetings and making their space available for other small emerging organizations this past season they've collaborated with teatro michigan for their space Chico has they say yes to the press program that's specifically designed for access and equity in partnership with children's first Leadership Academy which serves homeless students in grades K through eight our general operating supports three categories subu supports our community based arts and cultural organizations with budgets as small as twenty-five thousand dollars in this category the organization receives a flat recommendation of five thousand dollars criteria used by the panel is based on the organization's efforts to either grow or sustain the organization examples of areas important to growth and sustainability include program planning financial system controls and board development the images here from top to bottom are north valley orchestras Youth Orchestra young arts Arizona and cultural coalition new to this category this year is the North Valley Symphony Orchestra and also rising Youth Theatre and examples of public value programming in this group includes a theatre collaborative they produce a play reading series of the herd Museum called finding the circle which is a joint effort to encourage development of Native theatre companies and native playwrights Grand Canyon men's chorale partners with Southwest Center for hiv/aids and one in ten this past year they changed the location of the rehearsals to remove trans patient transportation barriers to participation resulting in a significant increase in low-income and minority choral members and members with HIV AIDS cultural Coalition offers bilingual programs at Phoenix Center for the Arts at the request of the center to accommodate parents and children who are spanish-speaking so in our three levels of general operating support we serve organizations and districts one two four five six seven and eight the rental support program goal is to provide cash flow assistance to organizations that are the primary users of Symphony Hall working theater and curvature theatres all city-owned venues in FY 13 14 council directed our office to commit a hundred thousand dollars of our general fund appropriation to the rebel support category to augment 125,000 dollars in support from the Phoenix Convention Center these funds are intended to bridge the time lapse between the rental costs incurred and the revenue they received from ticket sales on average the grant represents about 30% of the organization's total performance rental costs as an eligibility requirement the organization's need to offer education and outreach program these images are from top to bottom students attending productions of Herberger theater ballet Arizona and Arizona opera rebel support program grantees include Arizona theatre companies Sutter dance ensemble Valley Theater and I theater collaborative which are the primary users at the Herberger theater and the symphony opera and ballet and ballet which are primary users of Orpheum and Symphony Hall the awards are based on the number of performances and the number of seats in their performance space and now Laura will take you through our grants or project grant categories in all of the arts learning grant is to take arts experiences out of the theater or studio space and partner with schools other organizations businesses community centers and others in the community grant awards are for amounts up to $3,500 or 3,500 new organizations are highlighted in the slide shown the first photo is School of hip-hop's Phoenix they work with Roosevelt schools in the East Lake Park community to bring a hip-hop and steam camp to young people in the surrounding neighborhoods the second photo is kids and focus professional photographers volunteer their time to work with students at children's first academy to engage students in one-on-one mentorship using a camera at the end of the residency students always keep their camera received a copies of their work published in a photography book and are able to share their work to a gallery exhibition the final photo is the Ballet Theatre of Phoenix a new organization busing elementary school students to their studio for introductory ballet classes at no cost here's a look at the arts learning grant recipients for fiscal year 2017 to 2018 almost all of these organizations are small and or growing organizations that depend on these funds to expand their projects and partnerships the festival category supports Phoenix based festivals that celebrate either in art form or a culture grant awards or for amounts up to $3,500 pictured first is the Arizona law Association it's the new year's festival based in Levine and a newly funded newly funded in the category this year next is a photo of returning grantees arab-american festival which has been in the valley for over 20 years and flamenco por la vidas festival de espana as mentioned the festival's category has grown this year with new grantees like Arizona Lau Association as well as serious style crew with a hip-hop anniversary festival in Teatro Bravo which will be hosting a body and soul indigenous food and art festival in south Phoenix we're excited on all of these new grantees in the candy arts grant program we will continue our efforts throughout the year to identify groups in all council districts and communities in Phoenix that qualify for funding in our various categories so there was a summary in your packet listing all 63 grants for a total of eight hundred sixty five thousand three hundred and forty six dollars and again this total doesn't include the new allocation of twenty thousand dollars or the neighborhood arts grants so we seek your approval for these recommendations in the arts and culture commissioner happy to answer any questions you have about these grants or a process are there any question just a comment I just really want to thank you for the we talked about diversity and spreading out the programs throughout the City of Phoenix that at one time it seemed like everything was happening in in downtown Phoenix which which is good for district seven and eight but the rest of the districts weren't actually benefiting from it so it looks like you worked really hard to include all the different districts and include all the different arts groups that are out there and I know that the key project that we asked you to do is look into educating our youth and especially with the schools being cut with their music and arts and all that that we need to pick up the load it seems like you did a great job in doing that so thank you Thank You Council we made a concerted effort in trying to address those matters through this program do I have a motion motion to approve second there's a second all those in favor please say aye I motion pop thank you very much it works are you guys then process item seven Papago Park 5k trail update I have cards so should we go vice-mayor it's your preference if you would like to hear the staff presentation and then the cards I think that might provide good content okay good morning vice mayor past or members of subcommittee at your request today we're here to discuss the enhancements to the Papago Park 5k fitness trail Alonso of ETA the deputy director of the Natural Resources Division is here to present today Alonso thank you thank you in your vice mayor members of the subcommittee just some information on the Papago 5k fitness trail it was really intended to enhance and augment to improve the amenity of ethical park and dedicated a 3.1 mile or basically a 5k fitness trail just because there were a lot of requests of those type of activities in that space it improved the Papago amenities themselves encourage physical activity we partnered with 50 Knicks as well citywide initiative just to include more physical activity this was one of our first opportunities to include that in our natural spaces and our natural resource division so we're very excited about that another portion that it really helped with was clearly delineating the trails in our in our areas and that's one of the topics of conversation will be a little more into but it was really intended for that as well and again to meet the demand to that type of amenity or special event space there is a governing or a guiding 2010 ethical master plan that we obviously do consider and look at as we move forward with any kind of recommendations or improvements to patrocle Park the 2010 ethical master plan itself was a partnering of many municipalities to include Phoenix Tempe and Scottsdale of course and then our partners at Salt River pima-maricopa Indian community as well and in respect to trails and trail systems is really intended to to look at the trail delineation out there practical park is one of those spaces that gives you the impression that you almost go anywhere when you're at it Papago Park just because it has a nice wide open space and so that does cause that issue of what we call non designated trails or spider trails or social trails basically trails that aren't in our trail system that aren't marked that aren't have appropriate signage so people know where they're at and overall as far as the the theme of the path achill master plan was really to enhance that for all park users and how we can get to that you do have a small handout in your in your packet as well I may reference it from time to time it's a one sheet handout and it just had some experts from the Papago trails master plan it's a two-page sighted similar to this it does have a discover path ago on the title there and it just has a couple of experts in respect to this topic which which are appropriate shortly after implementation of this trail system some citizens a handful of citizens that come to our table and say we have a concern we have an issue and their main issue or basically a theme was to remove that trail system and remove the designated trail out of that space we quickly met with the group met several times discussed about perspectives where we were coming from in our educational piece or public and we were trying to accomplish in that space as well just to try to come up with a win-win scenario or come up with some alternatives to that situation unfortunately this small group did consider the only option to be removed the trail and at the same time we did get positive feedback from from users previous users and new users as well so we'll note that as well just to give you a little perspective into space most of you are familiar with the space this is Papago Park the red trail system that you see there that lined out that is the designated 5k fitness trail there are some subsequent other trails that are existing as well in that same space a total about 8 miles or so of trails that's including the new two-month designated trails that we added to that piece and if you were to to look at that it's really this white portion I just felt into the map there so the rest were existing unfortunately again I mentioned we have designated trails as an ongoing opportunity to address issues that in our mount parks and reserves that location with a white trail was was used heavily by users so we try to incorporate again based on the master plan those non designated trails that we thought were does were able to be sustainable and improve those when you say we try to incorporate it who's we the Parks and Recreation Department specifically the Natural Resources Division so we have our Park Ranger force or under of course obviously monitoring the daily you we have a parks development section that works on the construction phase and make sure we're up to standard with the type of trail system and make sure it's sustainable we'd hate to put something and it's not going to be sustainable ours really the we along with the dedication I will include we in that is our partners which I'll go into now that also includes we as far as who we just discussed this with first off the citywide health initiative of 15 obviously was at the table to discuss this opportunity with us local businesses in that area specifically smart practice really came in financially as well to help support that their users their local business group a medical group from that area who also came to the table to say we use this on a daily basis on the weekdays weekends we like to see some improvement ways to help the community in that respect we also partnered with a service project partnership with Mission Continues wicked warriors a red white and blue and of course volunteer outdoors Arizona for the implementation piece again these are Phoenix based and groups as well where are some users but also we're looking for a possibility to give back to the community so we inserted that piece as well a little bit of the trail improvements themselves was a fitness equipment there was fitness equipments along the trail already existing so that was refurbished and we put and recycled along the trail where there could be better used for that space these decomposed granite was used for the delineation of the trail and that's one of those unique conversation piece that we mentioned earlier being it a decomposed granite not so natural obviously calls a little more attention to it but it serves a great purpose in this space again Pepa go being a kind of it open a lot of social spider trails really allowed individuals to know where they need to be on the trail and along with the the effort to try to create these special events in this space also helped that piece of it new signage which is a big piece of the master plan in our efforts as well to continue putting up the new signage with along with trail markers this one fortunately had some funding so we had some new boulders and that was donated money for boulders with with markings on it to fit the environment as well in that portion there at least your handout is on page 18 free with that effort as a master plan to do some special events so what we saw we saw quite a bit of increased use in that space a proverb probably for two main reasons one it's clearly delineated so people were able to stay on the trail they were supposed to be more guessing where to go on that trail system that probably has to be a big piece of it and then also the second piece is the special event piece that's coming in as well as you see these trends these numbers started in August and leading into May those numbers are pretty impressive those are monthly numbers from 1700 with the high in almost close to 7,000 in February in March so very impressive numbers from all types used again primarily I think people obviously were enjoying it we've got some new user groups into it but also allowing the people to make sure they stayed on the designated trail which created this kind of kind of a positive use the trend is normal though the trend is normal throughout our mountain parks and preserves you can imagine it does give these are busier on those cooler months so we see that all all over as far as amount parks and burgers but we just hadn't seen these types of numbers in this space when we were doing these pieces of course we did do the 404 permitting and an environmental piece as well to make sure that what we were doing is accurate into standard for a Parks and Recreation Department what we saw immediately was just a variety of users coming in multiple users at the same time whether it be family because they could take the stroller they can take the child it could be a walker they can be that kind of scenario along with obviously your friendly or your pets as well so we saw that type of increase and again the volume it was more inclusive although it's not an ABA accessible trail it is not an ADA accessible trail I'll mention that but it does provide access to a wider population with with different mobility issues so again it's a new user to don't able to potentially participate in this great space I alluded to special events as well we have nineteen to date from the time that it was implemented that's very impressive a variety of different users groups have come out to use a space from high school groups who use their running or use their races there again it's a 5k fitness or a designated 5k fitness trail to other partners as well as you can imagine but 19 to total and it's an impressive number for special events I will note there has been obvious discussion as well both internally with our groups and the individuals who may have posted to try to come up again with the win win or solution or some alternative when that wasn't really going in that direction we did open this up again to public comment in general it did go to our parks port in February and it went in to worsen or preserve subcommittee person or person no excuse me our Sonoran Preserve subcommittee heard the item on April 17th they had a working session a working session with both the people who may not see the benefit quite clearly and then of course other users who again are at the table saying this is great amenity we like to see that and more when honestly it did go back to May 22nd to the subcommittee the recommendation to the Parks Board which would be going up in August is to keep the the fitness trail just because that that was put on the table removed a fitness trail I'm based on their review and we do have our chair for the Sonoran Preserve subcommittee in the audience today I believe it's submitted a card mr. John furnace one unhappy to step set up at the table as well as he'd like or of course he had the comment card submitted but I'd like to thank him for his time as well and he's in the audience mr. John furnace you can raise your hand so again really the intent of this piece of amenity was was to bring an enhancement to the park improve the the area space itself and just create a more inclusive opportunity with with the effort to try to keep people quite honestly on a designated train in vice mayor members of the subcommittee if I might we did post the improvements where we're going to be coming to Papago Park this particular Park has multiple points of access and so we posted it in two locations unfortunately you know we learned from this and and our process will will improve because of the situation but you can enter off of McDowell you can enter up from the apartment over to the west you can enter at many many places off of Van Buren off of Galvan Parkway really the only place you can't enter is to the to the north where that where the reserve is of the the Air Force or the Army Air Force so that's that's the only place you can't enter it so putting two signs up didn't really get us we learned some very valuable lessons from this situation that we've improved our processes for public input I have cards and at John furnace John I'm assume you're in favor yes thank you madam chair members aboard my name is John furnace I'm the member and chair of the Phoenix snore and preserve mountain partisan preserves committee it's may be impaneled 1989 I believe it goes back when it was first targeting the preservative acquisition up north that kitties committees been modified and this Charter has been modified to broader wheat public input needs of the National Resource Division of Parks Department were seven members from the greater Phoenix area all private citizens all volunteers during Parks and Recreation board in February of this year Parks Board asked that we as a subcommittee review this particular topic in part because it goes back to as far back as October 27th parks board meeting when public comments started to appear at parks board meeting on this subject so I'm just going to use Alonso's calendar we had it on our April meeting again input from the public but the public meeting format didn't lend itself for a dialogue so we elected to take a working group outside of that took a subsection a non quorum to members of the subcommittee who were familiar with the trail hiked the trail and met with members of the public that attended that meeting on April 17th but it sent their invites to them and said let's get down and talk and we had an agenda gave each basically the two main sides on opportunity to present ten minutes and then went through a number of the items to include comments regarding master plan comments regarding utilization statistics coming comments regarding construction materials what's ripped but none of it was finished that meeting came back to the subcommittee our committee meeting on August may 22nd Gerry and I took the opportunity to brief the rest of the committee and discussion also took additional public comment put forward a recommendation that the the trail stay intact through courses discussion with the committee recommended an additional recommendation and that is that the Parkes group NRD go back and look at the possibility of use of stains or some other material that could bring the concrete in line with the surrounding environment little late to try to hit it now but later at least also in terms of our report going forward be serious consideration of using or aggressive tending for concrete's used in the parts and preserves it's a requirement for managing washes and erosion so if you've got to use it in places the question is does it have to appear like stark white concrete so none of it was the seven members present unanimously voted in favor with the addition of go back and investigate concrete staining thank you thank you thank you for your work Ryan cannon okay all right hello I want to thank you guys for having me here for today I'm the initiating initiating catalyst my name is Ryan cannon I'm the Mission Continues first Phoenix first service platoon leader I utilizing volunteers from our veteran community to constantly look for a service leadership to improve community through sustainable service projects in fact I looked at what was going on in Papago Park I saw that there was some concerns with various trails that were not identified as accurate people made in taking various other trails I also identified a lot of adult fitness equipment that had been overgrown not managed in what isn't being utilized so through the cooperation and amazing support from the city CA Phoenix Parks and Recreation reserve department particular Josh Cornell and course Scott Co V and again Alonzo's we came up with an idea I saw an idea I saw an opportunity so by looking at this adult fitness equipment knowing that we have the official labor we have the means to do it and doing the best with what funding we do have with our sponsors American Express and Bank of America I worked with mr. Eaton I worked with Wounded Warrior Project and team red white and blue to not only lift these barriers out but also put them in a designated 5k course so not only can you go out and use the 5k to gain community interest bring on additional members who may not be aware of Papago Park but also provide signs that gives the recommended sets repetitions for dynamic and static stretching that we did also work with asu's exercise science department with with a member of team RWB so again I'm initiative catalyst of what I thought was a great idea and I still think I'm very proud of what we did and well short but I'm working with it what I witnessed and what I saw and what I wanted to see continue to work to continue to happen is opportunity to work with savings Parks and Rec can you continue do this service leadership the outcome was amazing I didn't know was going to get this much attention and so what I saw was just the use of adult fitness equipment and a designated 5k became an amazing opportunity for us to bring something back to the community as you can see the results were that were up on the board earlier were quite impressive almost doubling the population again I wish that this stays intact and we continue to drive the the linking forces to designate 5k that brings in opportunity for people to raise money for other nonprofits and in finally it would enabled us to fulfill this Phoenix opportunity to increase the health and wellness for the community so thank you for your time thank you I just want to just a comment I just really want to thank you for everything you do out there I mean the wounded on warriors and team red white blue what you do with all of it not just at this site but throughout the City of Phoenix thank you and thanks to the men and women that served this great country and you're still giving back as volunteers so thank you thank you I think that is totally official right there Brianna be have Susana okay great thank you guys for giving me the opportunity to speak here I just kind of want to use this time to just show my support for this trail I know that there has been a deal of opposition on a number number of different issues with it but I'm speaking on both on behalf of daring adventures we do adaptive recreation here in Phoenix and then also as a member of the community I live close to Papago Park and I really enjoy that trail so I really became involved in this when I heard about some of the push back on this trail I think that this new 5k fitness trail provides great inclusion to the communities specifically the disability community I know Alonzo mentioned that it is not a DA which I do believe is actually a benefit of the trail the the DG that they put down made it wheelchair friendly and accessible for for hikers with different mobility impairments however it provides challenge that other accessible trails in the Phoenix area don't necessarily provide so having the inclines and the you know normal trail aspects is challenged yeah it is great for this trail you know I know that there are many other trails in the valley that hikers and mountain bikers can use according to the website there's something like 200 over 200 miles of trails in Phoenix and my research says that there's something like 11 miles of trails that are accessible in barrier-free so I definitely think that keeping this trail is a necessity in that not having it would be a disservice to the community and those that need barrier-free trails so overall you know I full supported this trail we as an organization have used it for many different event events and hikes and I know that it gets a lot of use out of out of those within this community so thank you very much thank you did you say that it was not a da yeah it's not a da and just thank you Jerry kettle hood I was like is it our hurt heart little kettle hug um so um Thank You vice mayor pasture for having me and councilmembers my name is Jerry kettle hat and I'm the executive director for Darrin adventures and we provide outdoor recreation for people of all abilities we've been in business for 25 years and with the creation of this trail we were very happy as Brenda said there's not very many trails that we can take our participants to we have two arms of our organization one is where we provide adaptive recreation for the general public but then just this last year we started the brand new program which we call healthy day recreation where we provide outdoor recreation for individuals in group homes and DPAs day training for adults and it has really been magnificent enhancement to our program where we can take a person out to this trail and they can get to use it you know within their ability and then we are there to assist them whether they're in a wheelchair and so forth but as Brennan mentioned it is very important for an individual to really kind of push their limits you know we wear our tagline is we want to get you to your Everest and this trail really allows a person to do that because it has all the different types of skills that are needed to navigate that and so forth so thank you so much those are all the cards - has anybody any of my colleagues have any questions you know we're just getting an update and information good so just a comment I appreciate everyone coming out and speaking up thank you to our parks team it's a part of the Phoenix initiative you know we have fit Phoenix walking trails in parks today we have programs with senior centers after-school programs the idea is to to become one of the healthiest cities in the country and nothing stops Phoenix from becoming the healthiest city we can be every single day and it needs to be a program that's for everyone and so so this is very important now I was in that photo for the ribbon-cutting and I'm very proud of that trail and I also met with neighbors who you know later realized that there was a paved trail and and wanted to meet and so I met with the neighbors there I even worked city staff to to figure out what options would be if any of course I will always advocate for a public process it has to be a public process it needs real public input and and so so this is a this is a great update stand it you know there are some who aren't supportive of having a paved trail I think today we've heard from others that do appreciate the fact that we have a paved trail and so you know we have to continue to work that process but it's important to note that this program this fitting initiative and this vision of becoming that the healthiest we can be needs to be something that that fits for for every nation and so anyway I'm appreciative of the of the update and for all of those that came out to speak I'm now happy my concern is the lack of input from the community yet I think we need to start doing a better job of just reaching out I mean it's a great project it's something that I think we could actually listened to more individuals in creating it maybe even a better trail than what we have now I think where people are upset and angry is that we're using tax dollars and other resources and they want to make sure that they have an input it's kind of difficult for ourselves because we're separated from two different entities here we have the parks board and we have the subcommittee and basically a lot of the approval for these types of programs come out of the parks board and then where we're actually informed after it's approved so I believe that in the future I'd like to see somehow are some type of outreach more than just putting two signs if I mean with staffs out there all the times seen the hikers and and individuals that use the facility if we can just actually reach out to the community and basically let them know I don't think that people are angry or upset about the trail itself I think where people are angry mad is that there's a lack of input from from the green so and I always thought it was a trail that a DA compatible but we're hearing that it is but it's it isn't but it's a good thing because it's challenging for individuals with all abilities and I like that term abilities and I think that it's I think we got to find that common ground or we bring everyone we gather right so that's the only simple I have they're concerned thank you so one of the concerns that I faced as a chair is that and many of us face it sit on the parks board is that as councilman Nowakowski has stated we have a parks board and a lot of things happen through the park board and they have a greater authority than the subcommittee and people don't understand that because the board it's in the Charter and they have they have the ability to make decisions and then as a committee we get the decisions or the aftermath of some of the decisions made and the funding and every other dynamic that goes along with it and then people our constituents or the city across the board feel like why didn't you say something or why didn't you do anything and so this is the push-pull me that we have I would say internally with the board and a subcommittee what and the reason why I brought this to put it up on an honor to subcommittee was due to the fact that I was getting a lot of constituents questions and asking what happened I wasn't aware of it because I'm not aware of everything that's happening in the park you're not so no and I can admit that and so what when it starts to bubble what really concerned me was the public input and really the lack of the public input and so that is seems to be a thread or a theme that we're obviously needing to fix and I think and I believe that everybody should have access to the park and the mobility through the park and through this whole process we have opened up access and mobility the other the reason why I'd asked you a question about ata was because I was told that the reason why the sidewalk was placed in there why was in there was to 488 compliance so that's why I was like wait a minute you just told me something totally different than what I was told and so it's I guess good to hear in the sense that that it provides challenges and it provides a different form of I guess exercise and pushing you're pushing yourself your will internally you guys have more will than I do and in those challenging courses so that's the good upside about all and the upside about it is that it opened up a whole new world for many people and I think probably we wouldn't be at this point if we hadn't had conversations and had opened it up and had did I do diligence in order for people to understand across the board what was going on and so those that brought this to my attention I noticed are not here and so I'm I'm kind of I would would've loved to you know just I've heard okay this is what happened this is how it happened we can admit to that there wasn't a huge public process in this this is how it was come about but look at what it did and look at how it opened up a whole new world for everybody else so I'm not really sure if I will get any more comments or dialogue but I just want to let you in the audience how it ended up here and how we why we're managing it the way we are so just want to let you know I I was told that the parks board voted to keep the trail and that's my understanding vice mayor pass to our members of subcommittee it will actually be going to the full parks board on in August as a result of the recommendation from the subcommittee the Sonoran Preserve subcommittee okay so they will have another opportunity to come in and talk talk okay all right well thank you for your information next item is Parks and Recreation public input process vice mayor past story members subcommittee so our last topic leads perfectly into this topic this topic was requested at the May meeting as well and so we're here to give you some feedback and information on what we currently do for public input process it is important for us to hear from the community it is important for us to have comprehensive input to plan parks to not only meet the needs of the community but to hear what the wants are and what we can provide to each community each community does vary some communities what pickleball for example and other communities want soccer so not every community wants the same thing the types of public input we we have are for input for new and revised master plans for example a part that is being redeveloped would be one of those new master plans but we've had situations where we've done master plans in the past and didn't have funding to go forward and so those master plans sat on the Shelf if it's been more than five years we go back out to the community because things change in five years capital projects that would include things like buildings or courts denied types of those types of things playgrounds building a brand new playground some parts don't have playgrounds so if we're going to build a brand new playground we get input from the community if we're going to renovate a playground we bring three options and we let people choose trail development as well especially particularly trailheads Apache wash is a good example of that the opportunities for people to to give public input each project is a little bit different some are smaller some are larger we have steering committees and at the steering committees there's group from the neighborhood that's selected we usually ask the council for ideas of people who might want to serve on a committee and we take those folks and create a steering committee and invite people to come in neighborhood meetings if people can't come to meetings we put things online so people can give us feedback their review by the parks subcommittee as they're needed and Parks and Recreation board meetings as well we have these events called say hey and so we have an event at the park where we have staff just there and we have a couple of boards up and they give options you see the picture right here where kids are putting stickers on which playground they might want we also put information signs at the park so people can can't attend those meetings can give us feedback the way we notify people it varies again depending on the particular situation we do use the NSD Neighborhood Services Department to help us get to some of those community groups that they have direct contact with sometimes churches if a church right next door one that I remember quite vividly is one up in south Phoenix the church right next door really had a lot of input into that particular part we post flyers at locations we go to community centers as well and we do post the park as well some recent examples willow Park there was during committee meetings four of them held for that we also had a community meeting with comment cards so people gave us their feedback they did the dot so they could tell us what they wanted and we do put a coming soon sign up that Park is 2.2 two acres so it's a smaller park the Tennis Center a variety of meetings with the community on what they want to see in that Tennis Center building several years ago we did 25 courts and now the building is the next thing that we're doing there and we've had not only operator but also the people from the community who used the tennis center Cesar Chavez again steering committees community meetings with comment cards and and some great things came out of that and amphitheater dog parks soccer fields that park with the golf course included is 186 acre so you can see there's a wide variety of facilities and the most recent example of a trail this trail here is off of Pima Canyon and we're going to improve the parking lot again we had steering steering committee meetings we did Survey Monkey some people could not attend we got lots of feedback on lights somewhat light some don't want lights and so we're getting to a level of light that is acceptable to everybody but that's all because of community feedback and so those are the examples that we have in some cases we use private firms to help us get feedback in smaller parks we just use city staff to do that so those are the variety of things that we do to ascertain public impact input again I think we've acknowledged from the last situation we could have done a better job on that and we are committed to to making sure that we don't have that situation happened yesterday thank you I have comment cards a Sarah Porter she's neutral well good morning I'm Sarah Porter and I have the privilege of serving as the chair of the Phoenix Parks Board and I'm in my second term and I always say it's the best volunteer gig that a person can ever have because in my years I think I'm maybe in my seventh year I've learned so much about the parks the park system councilman Nowakowski wife was somebody who was a mentor to me when I first started on the board I realized she knew an immense amount about the park system and that I needed to learn it and I wanted to say that I appreciate very much chair person pester and council members that you are looking at public input and how much public input is going into the kinds of decisions that the Parks Board and the parks department is making but I wouldn't like to let one anomaly that a lot of people have acknowledged was an opportunity for doing better and lessons learned to be the thing that tips the scale or causes us to change the way we do things until we really look into the matter more I believe this is an instance that was anomalous the fact that the people who were were unhappy about the trail decision are not here is indicative I think of the fact that it truly is anomaly I think the decision would have been the same regardless of how much public input had happened and I want to let you know that I met personally with one of the aggrieved people I meet personally a lot with people who are who want to have input into what's going on I've met about lights I've met about South Mountain and I met about Echo Canyon I've met a lot about Hance Park and that's all to say that I appreciate the concern about public input I think the parks board is actually adding value to the city system by being another big venue for public input and I would invite you at any time please feel free to contact me and I would love to work with the subcommittee to make sure that we have the best possible processes for public input thank you I have a comment for Sarah first vlog this one thank you for being the chair for the last couple years I know how hard that is and everything that the parks board members go through and it's really a sounding board for us but I think that one of the things that I find it kind of frustrating is how do we work better together with this subcommittee and the Parks Board or maybe even having in the future some type of a retreat or so where we can start to tell you all what we're actually the reactions that we get from the community because I think what you all do is a great job I mean you guys are volunteers and you go beyond that volunteerism and you meet and you take time away from your family from your jobs and you're all volunteers doing this and I think as elected official representing a certain district I think it's important for you all to hear what some of the concerns are that I'm hearing from individuals that live in my district I think we just need that lines of communications on our we would welcome a discussion about how to open up lines of communication thank you thank you thank you John Ernest thank you I'm going to just build on the angers presentation the extensive portfolio of public input processes that is used by parks and mandated by Sarah and the Parks Board as recently as last week and Councilman I think your bride would attest to it significant emphasis on public input in regarding any of the decisions and would ask that you view the last item that's on the agenda as an anomaly and recognize give some thought to how many items may actually actually do go through the parts board that don't bubble up and add to this level of input attention so I both as a source of input with the committee we have what we are subject open meeting laws so even our subcommittee has posted and we draw for public comment there and as an avid user of the parks and trail system I've also been on the input end to a number of the processes South Mountain North Mountain Phoenix preserved so it's an extensive input process so many times I've looked at it and said I thought overkill but after today I'll just keep that council so anyway thank you thank you and Greta Roderick nice okay already then thank you for that information so we're moving to item 9 and if you notice since we've been talking about the dynamics between [Music] the committee and the Parks and Rec sports I have now started to include starting today with this meeting and then in the future to start reviewing what's on the park board agenda to see if there's any items that then we need to discuss or if we have heard anything from Marcus situates so that then there's a dialogue I've been in three years now and I have not and it could it's my fault I guess that I was very much kind of told the Parks Board does this and this is what your job is to do and so what I am trying to say now is I'm opening it up and I am going to start having dialogue so that we're all in sync as to how we want to see our city grow and be built and so to Sarah and John I'm just letting you know that I will be actively engaged and so will the committee in seeing what is what is moving forward because this is not the only item there have been other items we just I just have gone with the flow so thank you vice mayor Pastore members of the subcommittee today I have a list of the last meeting which was held in May I can use this thing to go might need to have somebody advance that for me well there you go Oh too much now all right so we break our agenda up into three categories information items and these are the items that were listed for information marketing and communication plan which talked about hiking safety and how we're increasing hiking safety awareness Margaret T Hance Park which is just an update we do every month for that group as well it talks about the economic impact study that is currently being processed also the memorandum of understanding with the Phoenix Community Alliance as well as the Hance Park Conservancy to help raise money and the master plan implementation that will be on the agenda for the full council on July 6th South Mountain Park preserve infrastructure we're getting ready to make some improvements there so again one of the reason these two items are on the agenda for the parks board is again so that we could make sure that people were aware projects were starting and putting it in the forum where people would see that so South Mountain Park the two areas that are going to be proved first are going to be pima canyon which is on the on the south side of South Mountain and then the entrance point in big and little ramadas over on the other central avenue side of South Mountain Phoenix mountain preserves infrastructure again at the July start we're trying to do these mountain parks and Preserve and trail items starting in the summer so that we can get them done before the big hiking season starts again so our strategy will always be for us to do those kinds of things and the sewer line for Phoenix mountain preserves also known as the piestewa peak area will be the first thing on that agenda the second area is information and discussion items so we had a verbal report on little Canyon Park and what the Grand Canyon University and their contracted public information gatherers are going to do they're going to go and have three meetings so that those meetings can be gaining the interest of what the community wants around there so that was just a verbal report there were several individuals there to talk about that overall if this is something that happens if the the feedback we got if the park does get relocated they wanted to be a bigger better Park so that was the feedback we got from them but there will be more meetings to talk about that the North Mountain communication and facility and tower Road project that's the road that's off of 7th Street and they're going to be improving the the road and the tower up there so there will be some impact to hikers and again we just want to make sure people are aware of that there will be a moment where that road that people like the hike is going to be closed because of the the improvements that are being made then we have consent items which basically are usually the minutes and other things South Mountain Tower that type of item on the consent items and then the policy the request for approval for commemorative Rock this is to honor the young man Cody floam who was 12 it was 12 years old and he lost his life last year while when it was extremely warm so that was approved there is an opportunity to make a temporary round about a permanent round about out right there on 15th Avenue and right by the Palo Verde Golf Course so they needed a little bit of space off of our parking lot we will have the same amount of parking spots they'll just reconfigure the parking lot so that is something that was approved and then the final thing is a well placement on the in the Sonoran reserve area in the north part of town there's an area a landfill that has contamination and so this is just a monitor the groundwater so that the right things can happen to make sure that doesn't affect the drinking supply and so that was the agenda from May if there are any questions I can certainly answer them at this time anybody have any questions I just have a comment I remember sitting on this committee and I think the chairperson was Thomas in plot we actually had a joint meeting it was regarding on the topic was dog parks when the dog parks were actually a hot item and we decided that it was really important that both bodies come together and actually listen to the community so I think in the future even these joint meetings with the Parks Board and subcommittee coming together to talk about issues would be a way that I think that that you're looking for is that communications right and that was something that we've done in the past and it worked out pretty well the other thing I just want to comment on is on our staff I know within my district they sort to come up with a master plan I mean from from a large park like Cesar Chavez to to a small neighborhood park where you really gather the neighborhoods and you work with other departments like and NSD to find out what who are the connect who are the movers and shakers of those neighborhoods so I really want to thank all those individuals that oversee the parks you might have asked to write here them I'm looking at that really involved they're not just taking care of the parks but they're also involved in the community so I really want to thank your staff for going beyond just the parks but also getting involved in the community and finding thinking outside the box and coming up creative ways so thank you so I'm item 9 on my packet is different from what's on the slide just certain things that are not part of the packet and not coinciding with the slides so vice mayor passed or I I went with the substitute stuff but I can hope I didn't say call to order and I didn't talk about the directors briefing I certainly can do that in Suzanne no I'm just saying like I read my packet and so like a low so part tobacco free pilot update is not on this and then Thunderbird Art Center update and then there's it's just there's other stuff on here like the community outreach regarding little Canyon is not part of a vice mayor craft or members of the subcommittee this is actually the previous month's agenda all right that's one that I reviewed with you was the one that was just all right all right okay I apologize there's a lot of paper with review and we go through so that's why I need reminders so the one I reviewed with you was June the one that is in the packet was me okay got it well your honor sometimes I think I'm losing my mind there's so much information that comes our way item 10 mobile recreation updates miss Rogers just came back Oh Greta I just want to ask that we have a full report for the fiscal year that will end in three days on the golf courses and the operation and the financials thank you alright item ten all right vice vice mayor pastor members of subcommittee today we're here to present on the very popular and very fun Phoenix teen mobile recreation I do want to note that we have quite a few of our staff that are actually working on the mobile rec unit here and if you would just stand up real quick so these are the folks that are out there day in and day out we have four vans ready to go for the Fall the summer we take a little bit of a break I am going to let Tim Merritt and Esther Avila do the presentation today they are the two that are tasked with making sure that this program gets started and also that it is going to continue to evolve and really meet the needs of the community that we have as you remember the mobile recreation units are to go to those areas and parts that don't have community centers so we can engage the kids and the youth that don't have those opportunities so with that I'll turn it over to Tim and let him take over there we go good morning vice mayor passed our members of the subcommittee in 2015 the parks and received input from community members about the need to reach out to youth in the community the 2015 budget process designated $200,000 for the mobile recreation program and as a result the mobile recreation program was developed and was launched at over 25 city parks and we've reached out to 1,500 youth and teams so far the program was designed to provide supervised positive opportunities for youth and throughout the school year in high-need areas without recreation facilities so on November 16th to 2016 the sports band our first band was unveiled at Coronado Park to hundreds of children and families this event kicked off the start of the mobile recreation program and this program operates from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday throughout the school year with options for additional programming if needed so this slide shows our four vans that are currently that we currently have the music arts and culture band we call the Mack van is pictured on the bottom left slide and that was the second band that was implemented into the program and that was implemented in in April if you look to the top right you'll see the stem van and that van was just completed and then on the bottom right hand side we have the gaming band the you know we have great partners in the city and between the Public Works Department helping us find these vehicles because we only had $200,000 for the program these were underutilized vehicles that are now engaged in our program and helping activate parks for us the thing that I'd like to point out is that our Parks Department staff actually designed these logos this what you see any vehicles we have very talented staff and they were very creative and coming up with these as well we went out to the teams and asked them to vote on what colors they would like these vans to be so we had I think nine or ten or twelve different versions and these are the four that they selected so these slide this slide shows some of the activities that we do when we activate a park some of the activities are nine square hockey soccer basketball we also have the ability out of use and to do our crafts and painting and and one of the favorite things that the kids like to do is button making we've been averaging about 30 kids per day yeah the Vice mayor's photo looks like she's walking a shot there I don't we were averaging about 30 kids per day with our one van that was deployed at the time and with a high attendance of 50 kids and then that was at our Edison Park so with that said I'd like to introduce estra Esther Evelyn to talk about some of the partnerships that it took to make this all happen good morning vice mayor and members of the subcommittee we all know the value of our partners and that is really the unique feature to what we have done this time with mobile recreation in moving forward is we capture the fun we capture the kids and we're out there doing all these wonderful great things but we also know there are resources and other organizations who have just as much great information for these youth and serve these youth out in our community so we have reached out to these organizations and it could be education based a mission could be on health family resources so college people has come with us many of our city departments have come with us we are reaching out to organizations like kala teen and what they're doing Phoenix Center for the Arts and what they're doing so they can not only reach out and hit target areas that they're interested in it just enhances the program that much more so we're very very excited about that and we continue to reach out to other organizations that are out there serving our youth we one of the partners that we have obviously is Arizona State University and they were a huge component in the data collection so we initially did pilot data and the onset of the program being being beginning and dr. Wendy Holtzman who is the associate professor of Parks Recreation with ASU raise your hand doctor was very instrumental with her students to capture the data so they came out on the several months with us and they were the third party a set aside to capture information on different factors that the kids were able to answer and so with that data collection it's an initial data collection we will come back out this fall and do real real data to help us now that we have learned some things and then we will do a third year of data final data so we will have three years of data specific to this to take the web program which we're very excited about that I think we will learn many things moving forward some of those things we learned and the staff that were just introduced is just identifying kids who are just hanging out and how to engage with them and in some instances we had some not-so-good behavior happening where staff were able to engage kids and get them playing in basketball or some different activities and they were looking forward some of the comments they were looking forward to staff coming back and so that's a very positive thing and that's what we want to see moving forward we were pleased with also learning about being flexible so some of the times that we had available we will be looking at the hours so when it gets hotter obviously our kids were coming out later into the evening versus the time that we were out there so we will learn we will tweak some of the hours that we were out there based on the season the four vans the one thing we heard the most was consistency we purposely had one consistent site every single week and that was the that was where we saw the the greatest strength and and us being able to really get the results that we were looking for so we will have four vans 20 sides you will have each of those 20 sites will be consistent every single week moving forward and staff is working all the details out on that we look forward to the fall with the floor van with all the different variety that is happening bringing recreation positive recreation to areas of our city that do not have a community center or Recreation Center and so thank you very much and we will answer any questions you may have the vice mayor if I might as well all of the units will have Wi-Fi I think that's some that we important to mention because that is something that is important to a lot of the ancillary activities that we're going to have happen every every unit will have some sports and recreation but then each one will have their own particular theme as well and we'll make sure that kids get exposed to all that have fun now captain we had a star-spangled celebration on Memorial Day weekend it was just incredible and once you your staff was out there with all the games and I mean that human krypton criss cross is just I mean thinking outside the box coming up with games and activities for kids that it's easy just getting some PVC pipes and creating crisscross board and using human beings as as the crosses and the other this was just incredible to see that but what I liked about it is that you had young people that were mentors for other young people and the parents just loved them they were saying how can we get this in our neighborhood park so I think the problem were going to have in the future is that they're going to want 100 of those vans throughout the City of Phoenix and I think our goal should be to try to get at least one per district so that we can actually coordinate per district or so I think that it's been a big hit within the community I can tell you that having those 5,000 people out there that celebration just experiencing that and the information about the parks also that's really important the programs that we have and not just sharing about the programs within the parks but also our libraries and other resources at the city hat so I want to thank you for reaching out throughout different departments and it becomes more of a community fair than it really is just erect facility the other thing in the future is all so when I was younger we used to have different activities for teenagers and that happened at nighttime I know that Churchill used to be very involved but they kind of bailed out of that and now kids aren't allowed to even hang out in the malls and you can only go to the movies so many times a year and there's not really any nightclubs for teenagers so we I think it's up to us as the Parks and Rec and how can we really create activities for kids especially at nighttime when they when they get bored at home and they want to do something where it's a safe environment for young people to come together and just have some good clean fun what's been happening is a lot of these young people wanted a parent to leave and they have these backyard parties and then somebody brings in drugs alcohol and it becomes a bad experience so I think as a parent of six children I think it's important that we try to find alternative things for kids to do here in the City of Phoenix so once again thank you for creating this this idea it's just a great idea that having these vans go out and vehicles thank you thank you I want to thank you stand again please that our leaders who are leading the way and are let's give them a round of applause so so thank you for what you're doing because you're truly making a difference and and what a what a great concept bringing these activities to neighborhoods you know many of them don't have wouldn't have these types of opportunities otherwise so it's it's more than just conditioning the body but it's conditioning your mind as well you know with with the other intellectual topics that that are that are being covered here you know are you there as having an opportunity to express themselves through art and you know unfortunately there are a lot of schools right now that don't have art and and so as we continue to move forward in that direction city Phoenix is taking it to the streets and taking it into these neighborhoods just yesterday we talked about a topic that is incredibly important to me into all of us and that's code Phoenix along the lines of stem but bringing those opportunities to and that exposure to coding computer science to our kids that's our youth all over Phoenix that's that's very very important those opportunities are not prevalent right now in fact less than 25% of our schools in the country and our state offer computer science so the City of Phoenix taking the lead and that respect as well so I'm really excited about the overall concept of the mobile units but just having this inside glance of what it you know what they really do for our community and having a chance to meet our young leaders who are who are you know providing the the time and the energy to make sure that you know people are catching on and you know it's more than just exposure but people are taking part I think it makes us if in fact I know that it makes us a better community it makes us a better city so thank you so much for doing it so I'm really really proud I think it's been a year since we year-and-a-half since we got it up and going and moved this really became a organic project with disconnected youth and high school youth across the city we had a Youth Summit where people from different districts attended to talk about what their needs were and what they wanted from the city and this basically came out from that research from ASU and so I am actually really really excited and proud to see how it's evolved and where it was going Tim as you stated earlier the mobile bands the intention for the mobile recreation was to go into areas of underserved that didn't have a park that didn't have a community center we identified those areas my concern is when I look at the calendar it's all connected to the parks and so I really want to go back to the mission of where the students and that's and the team said we want them in areas where we have nothing and the mobile unit was intended for them to go in those areas to give them something I don't know if we partner up with the churches I don't know if we partner up you know there are area Daria's within our district because we have a map that demonstrate where they were supposed to have gone and so I want to relook at that and go back to the original mission to provide that to those areas the other pieces I think it's good that we are partnering up with the parks because it adds other structured activity so maybe that's what we need to do for the future is really push for more of those mobile bands or mobile activities to be at the parks but there are areas in both your both your districts that don't have anything and I did the research I have somebody to the research for me to show me where the where there's just nothing for students and so I just want to make sure we're we're hitting the goal or the mission by Samara pestering members of the subcommittee we certainly will come back to each of the council districts and get some feedback on where you would like us to go again you have that day-to-day connection with the community and and we want to make sure we're evaluating that as well so we will come back and we'll work with the calendar thank you great work ah I think I'm up up called to the public Jerri Ranga i Jeremy van gasps I hadn't planned on talking but since this is the last subcommittee meeting until September I guess my takeaway today is that there's a sense of confusion about all these entities related to parks the park system we got the parks department we got the park subcommittee we've got the parks board we got to snore and Preserve subcommittee and then we've forgotten to mention the three pi Oversight Committee so there's five entities and for what you know I don't think it's even arguably the largest municipal park system in the country it's definitely the most used there's more users out in our Mountain Park and Preserve system than the Grand Canyon and I like to call it an urban National Park that's basically what it is it's also you know I also like to say it's the greatest asset that the city has because our Mountain Preserve and open spaces and at the same time you know I I just did theirs declare we need a clarification of you know the purpose the responsibilities of each of these entities because there's a flow between them doesn't seem to be there you know it's you know as much as I'm involved in this I can't keep up when they're when these meetings are taking place there doesn't seem to there seems to be doesn't seem to be the overlap between them and so I think it would really help and you know it's going to take some time to coordinate them but I'd like to see that because that would help with the input because right now a lot of people don't know which committee to go to which entity and consequently we end up with you know people seeing you know feeling left out and so have a good summer Thank You Jerry and one more the most important entities this public comments thank you for coming any future agenda item Nicholas maybe not for the message meeting but in the future the data that the doctor is gathering I think it's really important to find out what the needs are out there in the community what young people are are really asking for and what what their needs are so gathering all that data and reporting it back to us would be some crucial information that I think we can help help us make our decisions when we vote on different things when it comes to parts of Rick's stuff thank you are the questions yeah survey I think that's it have a great summer you", "EK_ho-G5n_I": "all right and the clicker is right there and this laser so you understand while she's doing that our speaker is Matt Stricker's we don't have the thin yeah yeah okay I'm Matt Stricker's I have a real maintenance Mathias and when I was a kid it was Mathias furnace Richard Stricker's and with the family I grew up my nickname was Pope Pius Mathias little did they know that was a public side of me it wasn't the real Santa beta so I'm gonna kind of let you know a little bit about me I actually grew up in South Dakota it was a bit of a Hellraiser I was an alcoholic by the time I was only five or six years of age I grew up in a mentally you know family my folks probably once they realized what the family was like say that they could have been family members for me because of my acting out behavior my world changed after I dropped out of college and joined the Navy I was in Southeast Asia and had an event that could being a man and I became a human being it's been a couple of years did some search and rescue my last search and rescue within about two months of that I got sober from all kinds of things and within two months of that I quit having DTS and I quit having certain kinds of things and I think it kept me from having the bad kind of PTSD than many Vietnam vets - yeah that got involved with LSD drop-in centers I got involved with Alcoholics Anonymous I got involved with community support groups and over the years I've done several things besides going to college and getting a doctorate was an actual police psychologists work this Reeves has spent 28 years in the Navy research warriors active I also developed a belief that students needed to really get involved in understanding alka and drug issues with other students and I developed a nation's first 24 hours a day alcohol poisoning and drug crisis teams and the first accredited alcohol and drug program at a university in the Midwest and with my background family personal and then working with students working on the forest reservation in the United States and now coming to New Mexico it seems like nothing's changed you know in a lot of ways when it comes to the kinds of issues that we face right now I'm the supervisor of psychology for the adult psychiatric de Bishop of New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute and that means that work get up in the morning go to work look after hours I may have met some of your family members you may have heard them talked about me if they say nice things it's true they say bad things it's true everything our clients say we have to take with that beliefs but some part of them they believe it tonight I want to talk to you about conquering disorders the corcoran disorder comes from us in many ways it used to be called the double-trouble disorder some of you have maybe heard of double trouble groups New Mexico was one of the last States to pretty much get rid of the phrase double trouble because it meant double trouble I'm gonna get my glasses so I can read what I wrote here a doubling trouble labeled stigma when a person experiences when they're told they got a dual diagnosis - and it was also double trouble - times higher to heal two times it's difficult to maintain medication adherence once a person left a hospital or what's a person kind of weaned themselves away from an outpatient program two times it's difficult to the family to provide support because it's hard to figure out is that person in front of me right now somebody who's hi somebody who's using somebody who has got a secret that I can't figure out why they're acting different or is it the mental illness what is it that was presented right there in front of us as well as two times the energy to support that person okay call a curry essentially means it's the chicken and the egg families sometimes have to figure out did this person really have schizophrenia or schizoaffective or a psychotic disorder and then later on they find out that the person was drinking doing methamphetamine doing extra Neverland or a whole bunch of extra moolah we're playing the skittles game how many of you know what the skittles game is medicine cabinets have all kinds of pretty colored gels and sometimes junior high kids make graceful kids and high school kids I'll bring a little bit for mom and dad's medicine cabinet they put it in a bowl they go to a party they're lighting usually say that they're going to the game or they're going to do something else and they get together they drink a little bit and they take some skills you know like the candy skittles all these multicolored things they play that it changes the brain it changes who they are usually we don't find out until we go to the medicine cabinet for our own meds and some I don't remember taking those in there dog some parents find out they had a child who had been using since age 8 9 10 or 11 or 12 whatever it might have been the smallest group the youngest group that I've worked with with substance use has been 7 to 12 year olds and that was doing work out in California fully diagnosed substance users in treatment through Family Court or through the Navy system so sometimes we have to figure out are we looking at the chicken what presents to psychiatry or are we looking at the egg what was fertilized and grew inside of the shell and it came up looks like a chicken walks like a chicken clucks like a chicken but maybe that egg is something else maybe that egg had alcohol or methamphetamine or something in it so part of our job is to figure out do we have the right diagnosis so dual diagnosis we wonder about it there are some common factors that people say our part of dual diagnosis common factors and one of the things we know about common factors for people who often develop substance use disorders is they may have an antisocial personality maybe a borderline personality disorder that accounts for some increase in their dual diagnosis okay and then there's the secondary substance use call the super sensitivity to alcohol or drugs some of us have mothers and fathers have grandfathers and grandmothers uncles and aunts who may have had a substance use disorder so we may get as part of our super sensitivity a bit of genetic said say mark can I use you for just a moment you man matzo no King person no family background with substance use at all he's got to drink a whole lot or he's got to do a lot of meth or he's got a lot of smoke a lot of dope before he gets addicted Matt's got a super sensitivity takes about this much where it takes a barrel for new super sensitivity and so my genes turn on with a war hmm now they've got the genes for mental illness I've got the genes for liver disease I've got the genes for a problem with my kidneys metabolizing oxidizing drugs at all and I've got the mental health stuff the substance stuff it may not take much for me to become a full-blown dually diagnosed or a khole occurring disordered person and that really raises havoc in the family the other one is there's a second psychiatric disorder model and that is some disorders themselves give rise to a certain kind of drug that feels good methamphetamine feels good because it raises levels of dopamine at the brain about seven times higher than a great kiss would raise it it gives us excited it is aimed at there is a particular drug Tripta lien out there they're really targets one cell in the brain and just a little use it goes ha from my belly button to my head from my nose to my toes from my lips to my fingertips it really makes me want to have them euphoria that sometimes comes with grandiosity sometimes with paranoia sometimes of that by poor expansion so I'm gonna have a little bit more of that stuff because I'm not cycling in my pipe or this stuff makes me really really feeling great mom dad don't bother me right now you're gonna ruin mine turn it up you're gonna ruin how great it feels I'm gonna go out and dig that hole to China in the backyard like I said I could do it and I don't like you do it trust me I know I can do it there's all of that stuff that we see with just buy more than how the substance is exacerbating or imitating it by poor I do want to tell you one thing now that the research does not truly support on co-occurring disorders there is minimal research that says people with bipolar disorder self-medicate I was always taught growing up when I studied alcohol and drug that those of us that have certain kinds of emotional problems or depression or whatever we medicate to feel better know we medicate to get high because it feels good getting high and it can help us with what is good inside of us or we feel like it does so we medicate ourselves but you know what if I say I'm self-medicating the team you're gonna take a little bit of sadness for me you're gonna probably want to get me to a psychiatrist dress so I don't have to self-medicate but I don't take the bills that I keep using this substance that helps me feel what or normal every disorder that supposed of the weekend diagnosed has different symptoms some of them look like other symptoms and virtually most of the drugs and alcohol we have in this country can imitate with extensive use any of the mental illnesses these are the classes of drugs okay we have alcohol you all heard of that we have caffeine do you know the caffeine is a wonderful simulant in chocolate candy bars also have that nothing amphetamine ever talked about little mean did you know that that takes place when you're in love and you look at something in your heart goes oh oh my goodness oh we use a fair amount of and let the mean yeah and chocolate have you ever known somebody it was depressed really like good dark chocolate can you get addicted to chocolate oh yeah can you get addicted to dr. pepper oh yeah sometimes you have to start your morning with a cup of coffee caffeine cannabis marijuana when I was doing up this was called dope everything else was called drugs I grew up in an age in the 60s and the 70s I went to war in a place where instead of smoking marijuana the way everybody else did because everybody else thought everybody else was smoking marijuana we were smoking marijuana and opium at the same time was always our pilots would sometimes fly when they were high we did search and rescue on marijuana and opium we did our job of marijuana and opium and if we ever had any injuries then morphine didn't do the job so we got a lot more morphine than other people it was really a great things during that timeframe without us realizing what was going on hallucinogens PCP and others the most common hallucinogen that you will have in your home is robitussin nyquil certain cough drops with dextromethorphan we use the right amount and you can get really high when a young person with the corporate disorder says that they miss being able to do LSD or peyote or mescaline and they start drinking four bottles of robitussin a day they end up with a substance induced schizophrenia bipolar episode psychotic episode how many of you knew that that non-opioid tested that gets you through a cold really has a very powerful dissociative hypnotic unit it's a really interesting inhalants there used to be a stayin out there that you never see of elderly and heywhat abuser because they died the brain doesn't work okay but some people to this day that I worked with that are 45 and 50 years of age saying that they're still creative going out and buying gold spray paint or silver spray paint but they're embarrassed to go into some of the places and ask somebody to unlock the cabinet so they can get their high inhalants now we have the opioids they in themselves can create cravings for some of the newer epic opioids that are way stronger than heroin there's a few new drugs out that they say is about they are about eleven hundred times than heroin I don't know if you all have experienced much of that in the community here I do know that we've had folks from this region who have tried some of those drugs and then we have the subject of knotek's and anxiolytics the benzodiazepines those things that really kind of make you feel good and buzzed to get rid of the anxiety your heart doesn't rush anymore you just feel kind of being dissolved and some people remember the hippy days of the 70s but when the zone you felt like doing the spaghetti dance you felt like you were going to truck you just had that groove on yes sir sorry I'm furious with suboxone yes suboxone Sabaton yeah it's a antagonist it works to help reason craving and do we have people crushing that and snorting it yes do we have people buying it on the street yes and they have an exacerbation of their psychosis or if they're bipolar or of their depression or then they go back to stealing breaking into houses selling things out of the house some of their personalities and stuff comes up yeah you've heard of Suboxone when it's used with a really good prescriber if it can be very helpful now we have our stimulants methamphetamine ritalin all those kinds of things dexedrine tobacco rarely do we get a mental illness that is triggered by tobacco use I've seen maybe 2 in 40 years and that was when somebody wanted to not only to that they ate almost a pound a day they got side got it before they ended up in the emergency room with an overdose of nicotine overdose and there may be some mother's we have lots of new kinds of drugs out there these are the classes of drugs now cannabis can cause psychosis caffeine can cause psychosis alcohol can cause psychosis hallucinogens are psychosis seducers inhalants causes psychosis opioids can cause psychosis and certain of them can cause psychosis that will last at last at last are sedative monican anxiolytics can cause have most psychosis but they usually don't are stimulants absolutely cause psychosis because they cause sleep dysregulation tobacco generally is considered a wonderful brain drug but the delivery mechanism is dangerous okay so these are the kinds of drugs we see out there on the street we're going to talk about some of the drugs that are kind of new drugs that imitate some of those old drugs call curring disorders a substance induced psychotic a substance induced mental illness can be caused when a person is withdrawing from a prescription drug burn and on the street drug a drug they make in their own home they can have all of these things like having bipolar depressive anxiety sleep disorder a delirium and what looks to be like a dementia on the draw on the intoxication phase or baby if they are using a prescription at psychotic antidepressant or something like that we can cause an exacerbation here is an example can I use use for just a moment just pretend that Luce has a bipolar disorder she once was given zoloft she took this all often all of a sudden her brain lit up she felt good she started being able to study better she felt like she was six foot tall and bulletproof she became really manic people at work noticed that she was working twice as how does anybody she volunteered for three or four shifts in a row all from the effects of so lot what happened she crashed everybody noticed that she had a full-blown substance induced bipolar episode from the drug that was given by a reputable and very careful prescribers okay so medication induce these areas there are sometimes what we see with the people who have been nicely medicated but then started using some substance on the side that you may or may not know about this is one of the things that we are really going to be struggling with soon just because it isn't illegal and now new cannabis with cannabis cards that doesn't mean that that substance is good for you that doesn't mean that it helps with reality functioning or testing or production and it certainly doesn't mean that it can be defined as having some positive reason for its use other than it feels good to use that kind of drug that's legal I really if I said I like making a bottle of robitussin before I go to bed because it gives me great dreams and I don't have any pain in my body and I sleep really good and then the fourth night that I use the bottle I have to have another bottle at 3 o'clock in the morning to get back to sleep just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's good for us and it cannot be considered biogenic it can't be considered as having something good to our life my voice matters to the person that has that call Corrine disorder and there are a lot of the names that go hand-in-hand with co-occurring some of them are pretty negative names some of them of the people call themselves I wish they have a nickel for every time somebody said well I'm just about job but then schizophrenic for 29 years and they're 40 years old they had the first break when they were 19 or a little bit basket case crazy alcoholic drug addict and you know language matters and there's all kinds of reasons that people in general not just people that have mental illness but yellow and I why do we use psychoactive substances sometimes peer pressure's sometimes we use it for medical sometimes we just want to experiment with that okay experimentally experimenting with drugs have helped develop many different street drugs we continue because it does relieve stress and pain some people function better the psychoactive substances some people cannot control a bipolar disorder unless they have a mood stabilizer or possibly an anti-psychotic or perhaps something else does that make sense we need drugs with all the changes we have and to cope with our mental health disorders and it feels stuck it absolutely feels good that's really exciting I want you all to remember these formulas at you well hold on makes flames okay in a nutshell 2010 - said after repeated drug use decided to use drugs is no longer voluntary because drugs change the brain I'm going on close to 48 years of sobriety from all drugs I got a little bit sick and somebody in an emergency room I told them I didn't use opioids so they gave me Matt the quail on for three days I refuse to go to leave the house because I was feeling as if I was way back in 1970-71 if it doesn't change the physical brain and very often they change the physical brain it changes our memory and changes our crazy just want to talk about synthetic drugs we have three kinds of synthetic drugs we have the psychedelic synthetic drugs we have synthetic stimulants methamphetamine is actually a synthetic stimulant ecstasy is a synthetic and we have synthetic what people call cannabis there is no marihuana in synthetic cannabis how many of you knew that there's zero do you mean THC Sigyn THC THC and synthetic cannabis there's no THC there's no CBD it's called spice it's called k2 it's called incense it's got a luck it's called funky Munky some places it's called so I like I'm so high man it's got all kinds of slang names but there's no marijuana in it but it changes the brain very equipment manufactured at Clemson University in 1995 it hit the street and lo and behold some really professional human beings called air force people discovered it they were in the Minuteman missile silos in places in Montana and North Dakota and Wyoming and their work went downhill they were passing their drug tests until one day somebody goofed and one of the airmen spilled the beans that he had been bringing in spice letting his friends use it and he lost and they lost a lot of their abilities to perform so some states outlawed it and the chemists then changed the chemical images a little bit so that one was illegal but the other one illegal and then they changed that one and that one that one too we have like 14 or 15 variations of the chemical that spice with we find somebody who has a psychotic disorder or an extremely manic disorder and they do not seem to be responding to the regular medications we make sure we have a good substance use assessment on them and we often find one of two synthetic drugs spices one of them bath salts or another one okay synthetic marijuana creates massive physical danger it changes the brain and that changes into psychological danger bath salts synthetic amphetamines creates psychological danger because it is such a rev up it is made to imitate a leafy substance that is used by many people in battle to stay awake for days because the psychological danger when people don't sleep they have sleep dysregulation and their brain plays tricks on them that's called psychoses and it will also cause physical danger because of the violence it creates what you can't see that very well now these are lists of all of the names for synthetic substances you have them in your DL if you can't see them I'll get you a big copy of it but just I can get those through your time okay so we just gonna say there's a whole bunch of them this is what spice looks like the first time I saw a spice I got called to the suicide attempt a guy gun walked into the place this was up north and there was a little kid alongside a coffee table licking wrappers like this first thing I did was I had to please take the kid out and then I realized I'm not up against somebody who's suicidal against somebody who's completely unpredictable because synthetic cannabis changes the brains we have less ability to think clearer if we would use it we have less rationality less logic and if you are my mom or dad and you you've discovered that I have bipolar disorder and I'm using SPICE there's less likelihood I'm gonna pay any attention to you because I don't have to because I'm better than you besides that I feel pretty good and I'm maybe gonna fight the people that you take me to the ER community guidance center because there's aggression with it it's the nature of that it's not really spice is not really a bath salt is not really incense synthetic amphetamines are called bath salts they're called bath salts because it was connected to a girl on TV who used to do the ivory snow deal in the bathtub she was covered with foam they used that marketing label that almost looked like the ivory label who they first came out how many of you do that altar people recognize the Acme girls remember people don't it's chemically based it is not plant derived because it is chemically based and you can get people that want it can get recipes on the Internet worth they can go to super because drug stars farman implement stores beauty shops and they can buy the substances they can make their own bath salts and I've got a recipe up there form a slope that you want to see it it's in the detail that people actually use if you were recognized you have some of those as motions at home some of those things that are nice for our body oh you could smoke it you can inject it you can snort it you can put it in your local area and some people are doing other creative ways that are extremely dangerous it'll speed your heart way up and give you panic attacks and when you get panic attacks and you also have a paranoia you get really dangerous you don't know who to trust it can be very intense and there's a lot of violence that then takes place and the rationality with police officers with the person is high-end bath salts like methamphetamine or spice it's gone places our patients the places our families at risk if they miss vessels it's a complex chemistry and it has changed over and over and over these are some other pictures the years ago there was a certain kind of person that enjoyed going to raves or these big party places and they would do what's called ecstasy started in England then it kind of migrated to the United States ecstasy pills looked exactly like this all those pretty little designs those pretty little colors now the research shows that if somebody has a mental illness and they want to use ecstasy and they buy it on the street if they've used ecstasy before and they know how to control their trip ninety percent of it is now bath salts and there's no controlling it so then the person panics you anxious they get angry and they end up having to go back into an emergency room and sometimes to a secular okay they hurt somebody bad and they go to jail now we have energy drinks how many of you know what an energy drink is okay when I talked to uh students at our university that drink up to six of them a day and then I let them know that we have had people overdose to try to kill themselves in it took only seven a day for them to have to be intubated an emergency really took a long time to recover and their brain did not recover we know now that energy drinks can cause a cardiac arrest can cause headaches and migraines can cause increased anxiety I use them energy drink to get energy I have anxiety it causes my heart to speed up and I got this little heart condition then every now and then I'm gonna have a little talent I'm gonna have a little flutter now I'm wondering if I'm having a heart attack and energy drinks and I panic and I can't control my insomnia related to new onset it's family genetics of time to die the penis can cause severe problems with drug interaction and it can cause addiction energy drinks have approximately five stimulant drugs or amino acids in them there are actually energy drinks we know that junior high kids who want to get high and stay high from energy drinks can actually go on the web and get a calculator they can put in their gender and their weight and how many energy they have to have in order to feel excited and how much they have to drink every couple hours to stay high and fun but it will also tell you what is a safe amount for you to use in one day and if you use that in one day don't use them for a week or so there's a new energy drink out called organic rock star it's got two stinger month seventh grill sugar organic kinds of yohimbe which is a stimulant seems to be much better but people say it tastes more like ginger ale it doesn't give me that rush that I want and I can cause risky behavior dinners and nervousness vomiting allergic reactions high blood pressure and some people get that niacin overdose do you know what a nice and over those feels like imagine you've got a thousand pins and needles there derives your skin all of a sudden becomes really flushed and you feel like your body and your stuff is moving inside and it's just you don't know if you're diver you thinking why I'm having a great body trip and some people like it but some people panic with it and they strike out and they'd heard heard books Google myosin overdose how much medicine you have to take to have that it's a normal reaction to myosin yes sir you know there's two different kinds in two different ways that you have our cashews and the you have these cravings are used depending on which kind of medicine but you'll him be bark when they use it in energy drinks it's not standardized some might have such a massive amount it creates almost in amphetamine or method main type reaction in some people yo hippy Marcus uses I prepared great medicine for men who have an erectile dysfunction for people who have back pain that need a little bit of extra energy it gives them through that but it can be very very dangerous okay have you ever seen you hit me bark on the trees um I've seen a miniature yeah oh yeah beautiful plant and I can call that stress hormone release okay these are energy drinks really want you to know we have two kinds of energy drinks I'm going to talk about those in a minute two different kinds of energy drinks and we have ecstasy it's a synthetic psychoactive drug that is stimulant and hallucinogen kind of properties similar to methamphetamine and mescaline but people that are using it now if it's not the original formula will have the stimulant and the methamphetamine reaction they won't have the trip that feels good where they expand their consciousness to just get angry those are some pictures we've seen that one before this is the original drug that bath salts are made out of this drug was actually sold in the marketplaces to fund Isis originally it was captured synthesized really got baked in England and other places it's native to East Africa and southern Arabia it is almost as common and places as chewy betelnut is to the people in the South Pacific which is a mild stimulant that helps them work more this helps us work like a caterpillar tractor with energy with verb I can't get it done it can be very dangerous some more pictures of a third of that ivory snow bath bar that used to be on the market a lot that's where the bath salts came from okay spice being abused by smoking alone Oregon marijuana they also be prepared as an herbal infusion for drinking drinking you get a different kind of high that you do if you smoke it five active chemicals most frequently found in spice all of them are scheduled drugs it's now legal to make them possess them or use them South Dakota has a law that if you have methamphetamine in your urine you can be arrested for possession of methamphetamine it used to be a felony but it's not anymore okay these are the main ingredients for the people including the people in northern New Mexico that I've taught you for making their home in spice acetone it's a solvent it hurts the brain if you'd like to any doing the inhalants don't use acetone it it's not good for the brain but just people ingest it tobacco or herbs for Bosco's simcha tomorrow leaves doc manana while hope it while marijuana skullcap and spearmint menthol or uses put together its ground together it's mixed together sometimes it's made with a you know heat we're an oil is extracted from it okay most of us would think that our family member who's got schizophrenia or bipolar disorder most of us would think that they come back with this together but they guess they can make their own excuse me yes does it separate something it actually I just recently went through a special program on suicide bombers and it's also used by suicide where suicide bombers because it does cause things to separate it is also used in Nazi labs I've taken them apart when I was a police officer and Trunks we have places where I came from that acetone is one of the things that we use along with certain kinds of other things that are combustible that the earth burned or weeks after the lab if you're a good cooker you hope so but a lot of people aren't a good cooker and the instructions aren't real good I hate to say it that way but a lot of people make mistakes when they are making these things somebody was making a high potency THC while they were driving on the front seat of the car that's to them they have been using some of that same substance that they were making they were so psychotic that weren't even staying on the road and they kind of burn takara it's kind of like people that cook that aren't chemists that can hurt themselves and their family sometimes family understand to why their child young male or female was making something ended up with burdens on their arms and they said oh I spilled something on it when I was blowing the lawn or something we actually have a caustic I'm thinking that's probably answering your question yes thank you cannabis like some light weight symptoms for the most part but in spice we see seizures we see problems with calcium and sodium we see hypertension high blood pressure consciousness agitation violent behavior and coma and it is generally the nurses in the emergency room that put 101 together and say hey I've got to find out is this person here using SPICE because this does not look like a physical condition in their urine is clean spice and bath salts do not show up in toxicology urine tests in emergency rooms hospitals can get them they're expensive they just don't physical dangers of synthetic drugs okay I guess we lost the physical name okay everything all the way up to strokes now rain bleeds psychosis and violence these are our alcohol based energy drinks some of us in here are old enough to remember a Red Bull when it first came out in 2004 it will have an ingredient in it that was banned and that ingredient was ephedra it was banned and ephedra is the main ingredient or extremely similar ingredient is used in making methamphetamine so instead of methamphetamine or a veteran now in it there are other substances that are stimulants including yohimbe or gharana or some of the other very powerful herbal of stimulus alcohol based energy drinks we know that people who use these and end up having to be in to an emergency room only about one out of ten will have to go to a psych unit because of the bad effects of the energy drinks for people that go to emergency rooms because of their energy drinks that don't have alcohol in them closer to five to eight out of ten may need to go to a psych unit for psychosis there's something about the alcohol in the energy drinks that helps reduce the likelihood of someone who has a psychotic middle of us were a history of it or to retake it too much and a half psychosis on its own to end up having to be intervened by medical folks so an issue is for families if somebody likes energy drink mild when you buy me an energy drink but you go to store give me an MLS give me a cold give me one of those last drinks please makes me feel good I can work harder around the house I can even go back to school and then you start noticing there's all kinds of empty energy drinks Europe to Canada energy drinks that's a warning sign okay not recoding THC did you know that the average levels in 2003 was 6.4 percent of the active ingredient that people use to get high was 624 in 2015 most estimations were above 15% do you know of any product that you can buy right now legally in New Mexico that has a THC content above 85% yes tell you about dude all of them it's actually not but soon they will be there okay I've got a friend who says you know I'm going to my 7/10 meeting you know what 710 is oh I L I'm going to an oil meeting I'm going to a wax TAC meeting a Rick Simpson oil meeting or maybe I bought a wax I can make one at home with what I buy from Amazon for $19.95 I can make a concentration of marijuana that is 85 to 90 percent at home and I smoked it I created an oil out of it we can buy them in pharmacies you could buy the actual oil in pharmacies now if you would think about what ninety-five percent THC would do for somebody's brain who's never had a supercharged cannabis high and all of a sudden they use this for the time and not only do they feel euphoric but it feels that if every cell in their body is smoothly communicating with other ones and there's a lot of different descriptions that I hear people who use this thing and there of course some of the people that we have in our houses that have severe pain that also have depression or PTSD a small amount of this oil could be very therapeutic okay we also know that it's illegally made in areas of northern New Mexico brought into our cities and salt ground cheaply but occasionally it will have a substance of it that will create an adverse reaction because it's more than marijuana it's more than some of the things that they used to extract what looks like a frosting that looks like a honey you know crystallized lemonade or Brooklyn it's really intense stuff we have powdered crystals called Keith we have dry crystals a little distance of things are there different things this is actually a hash Rick Simpson oil is up there that's what butane hash oil BHO sometimes the wax may look like there's rosin different kinds of things these here are all high THC these hair will Barry there's a handout there that talks it's a marketing deal from one of the marijuana sites it talks about all of the good stuff about marijuana and what you'll discover is that actually teaches people because psychologists or physicians or psychiatrists have right from new cards maybe don't tell the person that they're writing for medical marijuana what they need for their disorder which would be most helpful so we have lots of boats in our experience and using marijuana or cooking it or making it that actually talked about the benefits of certain things that supposedly work for the disorders now that are legal to be used to get a marijuana card so these are types of cannabis did you know that there are almost 800 strains or more cannabis now from the original tree and hybrids these are exciting what if I got a bullet from I'm a gonna have blue trim to matter am I gonna have chocolate okay no I think I'm gonna have something Afghan Kush no I want gems nah because that's 35% no that's only 29% no I feel I'm really eggs I ain't just I'm gonna have California since Amelia hybrid with crush with chocolate and vanilla hybrid oh I want a big pipe for that too I don't want to burn my lungs now think about this for those of us that have the mental illness and if we really wanted to feel better because we're not liking what's going on but we read about what that's going to do to our mind and our body piercing in with our spirit that can be really inviting it can be really inviting yes ma'am see something that just came up and it was related to can do the same thing called chatter splatter is got all kinds of different names and I think there's some of those names and the other little article that I have there and you're raising a great issue it is damaging people who have ever experienced a psychotic break it has damaged people who might in the past been able to use some marijuana in a low-risk way I'm not sure that today anymore I would even believe that marijuana can be low risk because we know that kids before the age of 16 who start smoking marijuana daily are more likely three to five times more likely to have a psychotic break or a suicide attempt by the time they are 24 25 and now we know that people who are using those same things are some new studies this article that I'm giving you is from a marijuana site that talks about the goodness now the journals are actually doing studies and rewarding studies that showing marijuana is extremely dangerous especially for people who have certain physical disorders disorders have a feel for how much of psychiatric disorders are psychiatric disorders how much are substance induced psychiatric disorders you know how much both I'm doing some research anticipating a question like that I took a look at every one of our but only here I've got people in other places that we build health centers taking a look at every one of the disorders that had psychosis we are finding over sixty percent have a stimulant induced psychosis after the first diagnosis with psychosis they were coming in to certain hospitals now here's the problem in the 60s and the 70s and 80s looks like a duck quacks like a duck quacks like a duck yes this is schizophrenia with help the questions of were there drug use drug problems that created it initially and when a person doesn't get better after they quit using that they still have the psychoses mental health it usually believes yes we have a true psychotic disorder here may not have started that way but it's going to stay that way so this is the symptom that's in front of us this is that human spirit in front of us now how do we treat that human spirit it's not always drugs sometimes it's a support group sometimes it's PSR sometimes it's some other organization sometimes it's churches yes mushrooms tend not to be cinnamon and juice per se they would more likely be if people here's an example of peyote peyote with people who are part of the Native American church that actually worked with a spiritual provider they don't have psychotic episodes that generally stay with them they just on another white guy might if he did do a tea or we might have people that didn't have an integrated spiritual belief with a guy to help them understand what the visions are they might have psychosis the flashbacks with hallucinogens are very real LSD causes flashbacks some people have flashbacks from LSA and we help people locally that make LSA which is close to LSD some hallucinogens PCP can have flashbacks with mescaline and THC together THC is mind-altering it changes perception it changes time commerce shade form how this image of is all made for changing and altering that because of the effects it has on certain receptors of the brain so it takes a little bit of mescaline a little bit of dab or something they come together potentiated potentiating so the individual effects boosts together and cause a much greater effect not enough research out of evidence and it sounds like you're seeing that as we are oh yes sir psychosocial rehab yeah mental health centers have psychosocial rehab centers where people with mental illness can often come in and learn coping skills aquarite came from we have a psychosocial rehab that worked with just co-occurring folks dual diagnosis folks and it seems like that works very well because other people who have drug and alcohol problems and schizophrenia or bipolar they related to other people and they learn coping skills from other people and sometimes our families would come in and talk about what they do is that the same as and there's a whole movement on the internet that talks about the garbled what might be seeding the United States with drugs but that's very different okay I brought some of those sites they're kind of interesting to read but that's not oh yeah because over the counter and the bottles at all the grocery stores it says error motion sickness but the ingredient is best no that's nurses what's the stuff for the ear man let me see it's the stuff that blocks air motion sickness start doing them something or other thank you no it sounds like it but it's not thank you good question thank you okay vertigo yeah perfect for vertigo knuckles II got mescaline meclizine so we have different strains of different wonderful names and you know what I like strawberry banana ice-cream thing is I haven't really liked that if I'm going to smoke marijuana I think and people that go with the marijuana cards into the stores there's so many different names of different kinds of things some people fare very well from what they get and they know if it'll work the depth at a particular pain or PTSD okay I'm going to talk a little bit about caffeine because caffeine is and most of our medications develops the medications work better it's a coffee tea's energy drinks firebugs chocolate cold remedies vitamin I guess I got vitamins way to battle g6 caffeine can cause a substance induced disorder called sleep dysregulation and when it's severe it used to be labeled sleep psychosis or sleep deprived psychosis now it's generally called a substance induced psychotic disorder or manic disorder at times always sure yeah I hope so I like my shorter sugars like 16 calories a teaspoon it's just do you know there are 16 tablespoons of sugar and most energy and there are some other really exciting drugs that we know kids made from their home not a certain countess yet there's some muscle relaxers or some anti-nausea stripes the old mix it with sprite if they can get some codeine don't mix them with that mix it with any kind of pop syrup and they make a drink they add a jolly ride rancher and spreader mouth doing it's called sister it's called lean used to be legal in California you could buy it and we have some people that actually have used so much of it they come in and they become nonverbal for weeks and weeks this are the things that have this dextromethorphan DX have psychoactive drug only common over-the-counter medications you drink this you get a really big high we do call that the choice for our transient population for mouth washes for $1 to $2 you can give a big bottle of 56 proof alcohol those beers are max 26 proof low-point beer was 3.2 percent alcohol which is six and a half okay active ingredients table you come up to us methyl silas a menthol included our water alcohol benzoic acid polymer 407 which is an inert substance sodium benzoate and caramel there are warnings if ingested please contact a doctor there's nothing in there and will hurt you much gets drunk will get you drunk now if you take a bottle of the hairspray and drink that because it's got alcohol in it there are neurotoxins and some of that and some homeless people will do that just to try it out okay abstinence what I talked about and there's a handout there the very last slide what can be done to assist people who have co-occurring disorders and you just read them real quick and then we'll answer a couple questions to be done support 12 steps a cocaine anonymous outpatient individual group with oversight with oversight would be this Tom thank you for bringing your son in here I'm going to ask when we send him home from each group every day you check and find out if he is using check his room to see if he's got any leafy substance in his room okay it's harming him we need you on board that's what oversight is somebody in the community somebody in the home to check residential treatment we have many residential centers oversight means random checks everybody gets a nuran test at least once a week and every urine screening tests for synthetic drugs in patient we have a bit more control over that but sometimes people bring things in sober living with oversight a sober-living house maybe one where a person goes in but we hear a lot that people bring in marijuana they bring in meth trade it transitional living houses with oversight and we're talking about this is a way that people who learn to control their substance addiction with their mental health concern and the minimum use houses there is I understand a minimun use house now in Albuquerque where alcoholics are allowed to have one to two drinks a night didn't make the game stuff don't get drunk they don't have some of the same issues and actually get jobs again and then no use with family includes significant other that is a rule that I have when I work with the person who wants to get sober no use with family the dad drinks a cocktail every night no use with family no use in front of our designated person well we forgot to tell you dad's the person with the co-occurring disorder we're here for support for dad or mom and then the greater the number of support counts have to be hood they will be okay there's a lot of words out there you have any questions that you have some great questions so thank you yes ma'am that's right that's true you know what as a human being one of the things I gotta be honest in telling you is that sometimes when the substance abuse is treated and extended in two months of recovery a lot of families don't see the mental health behaviors the mental health issue is still there but the exacerbated behaviors from the substance use are often less and the MFA person has a relapse we want to know whether or not a substance treated or triggered to relapse of the mental health issues sometimes it's easier to stabilize it is easier to say no Ellen teaches us about consciousness dyeing addiction depression and transcendence what are the implications for dual diagnosis of increased interest in psychedelic medicines like ketamine for treating depression we have not only ketamine we have ayahuasca some of the other psychedelic drugs there are kind of experimental in nature and even some of the researchers in Santa Fe have had really positive outcomes with specialized populations I'm not sure that they would treat anybody who had those but somebody who was motivated somebody that was medication adherence the real relevant issue is we are on the frontiers in many ways of how the brain works and now have new mechanisms to see if our treatments are working not only the drugs that can be used but also new imaging techniques that might tell us how the brain heals that's a pretty decent yes which they're using something our brains get used to our toxic substance over time as we withdraw and our brains heal from those toxic substances that could be in substances then we have to look at nutrition differently we have to look at replenishing the vitamins the minerals and the ways in which our body mind and body have been misused by reacting to a toxic substance one of the people I had the privilege of working with years ago sugar sugar sugar sugar the only problem was people never had diabetes and it ran into problems but he said we're going to give enough energy until the body can redo itself and maximize its normal energy production I wish there was a simple answer to that to me if I have a bad brain it may take me a year and a half to get back to normal if you have a math brain it may take you two months to get back to normal different bodies heal differently and different bodies need different things not every person with a bipolar disorder should have the same medicine as everybody else because it's symptom driven just like recovery deceptive driven and you're right sugar craving is an issue for some people for other people it's a curative whose question thank you yes sir or presentations you know when I was up in South Dakota we did like schools all over South Dakota like this yes I'm not sure what the prevention programs I here are doing if you would like to I could actually call the alcohol and drug dealing get the information back to Tom and he'd get it to you if you'd like I'll do my best to do that if you like when we did with our college students as we trained college fraternity and sorority and athlete athlete's leaders to go out and teach their teams and that we help them develop what the perfect program looks they thought the perfect program was for their teams and we have suit leaders in young as junior high including our reservation schools that are detention centers we taught them how to do the presentations and we practice let me express my gratitude for a long be to come and talk with you you probably can tell I have a passion for trying to help people heal mentally and heal from substances let us [Music]", "VhXMrFfKHM4": "China will educate the viewers at home watching I'm not yet known I have our very own very special guest in the house with us and I'm always happy when she's here and yes we have actually the professional when it comes to this aspect of taking care of your eyes in the house thank you very much all right watch it again [Music] [Music] let's pray in Jesus name everlasting father we'll just thank you for the privilege of

every one of us be blessed in Jesus mighty name tell our doctor here - just please listen to heart because of the looking at the topic we discussed this topic in our previous Edition and now we're going to look at it again the eye care tip for the year we need to take good care of our eyes and what we need to do or what we need to know as an individual that's what we do on this platform to give out the information the viewers at home what we need to do and what food we need to eat when it comes to our eyes taking proper care of me dr. Priscilla in Madison so you have any question if you like action dr. Priscilla when it comes to your eyes all the eyes of your little ones please just feel free get to listen to what she has to say then during our call yes you can get to call us and tell us your name volume up volume you TV set so that we can hang out and play once again thank you so much thank you want to look at this topic a game for the year last time here while we're discussing a lot of people called just to find out information w sending text messages to ask what food should we eat what fruits to istic to say that we have is better vision that was just Academy Cup organic discourse for people that missed out that didn't get to watch healthy living and for me that just you know continuation of what we discussed in our last edition so please man yeah thank you so much yeah we're actually looking at eye care tips for the year you see every year the year goes out and another deer comes in we find our people making some sort of resolutions to do certain things that they didn't do where the previous year or setting goals targets leading achieve you know they make conscious effort to ensure that's okay the new year coming we're going to do this we're going to do that so we are here synthesizing people that actual you don't make it such resolutions or changes you should include okay as part of your resolutions for the new year why this is important is studies have shown that many people a would really take the initiative to one have their eyes as a maid and of body five sense organs we have the organ of sight does the eyes is the most utilized of all five but as important as this eye is many people a larger percentage of the top of this would hardly ever on their own just say okay fine let me go check my eyes let me see how well I'm doing let me see how my family too is doing they hardly do that in Nigeria in particular people who only come you know for examination where they have problems now we are trying to shift that paradigm we want a paradigm shift as far as that is concerned because prevention is the makeup and if you want to prevent don't wait on to a problem happens before you start preventing so we are trying to say that as we enter this new year make it part of your resolution to take proper care of your eyes have your eyes examined not necessarily because you have an issue with the eyes but because you you don't want things to go wrong with the eyes because you want to prevent some of the eye problems now let's also recap you see we talked about some issues last time that many of the problems that we'll do a lot of damage to your eyes will not give you symptoms for instance glaucoma you may not feel the symptom they should there can be functional damage in the eye without you actually feeling it until is really significant but when you go for eye examination the doctor is able to detect any and then you can be treated but when you wait to you the whole thing crumbles treatment becomes very difficult the same thing with other eye issues so it's important for us to be proactive as we enter this new year that we should make it a part of our you know resolution to have your eyes examined and then not just only you as an adult children to should not be left out we are totally to devote family the father the mother and the children statistics also show that in a family most likely the father will be the first to have his or Eisenmann neglecting the mother after the mother the lists is the children and from my experience for my practice of Optometry I've been practicing for close to 20 years now here I've noticed that most in most families children they are the least likely group to have their eyes examined this I have actually built is a study that we carried out and I have found out to be true in my practice you see some parents can't call - okay I just want to check myself to check my wife for each other no no no no Lolita was just a child but want people to understand that the way the eye is developed the way visual goes is altered when a is developing as childhood it's better to correct it teach not to allow that I problem grow with this child into adulthood when that problem goes will be tied into adulthood it becomes more difficult to treat it require maybe if it's maybe an eye condition that you could have corrected with glasses at a yoga age by the time because it becomes an adult you find that that that person may have to wait last stroke would like to be able to see so it's better to correct such problems and then under that danger in that is when you don't allow your children have their eyes examined as well i conditioned our core employer maybe with time we'll talk about that again subsequently under I'll place the conditional whereby if a child has an eye problem are you ignore it you didn't correct it and you allowed the problem to grow with that child into adulthood but it time becomes it advice I got child because an adult such a problem becomes incurable if you cannot use glasses to correct it you cannot use drugs you cannot use surgery the I will look normal yet the child is not saying so and I appear is a very critical condition in childhood so as much as possible as we are discussing eye care tips for the year we need to look at it holistically we need to focus our mind on prevention that we need to prevent some of these problems and peradventure there are some problems already day it is good for us to go early to the eye clinics so that the doctor can detect it on time treated and then our eyes can be good for it a secret ton of trauma trees have also discovered that you see the Bible says God has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness when it comes to the eyes I have found out to be true if there's anything that impacted me personally as a human being is the fact that I studied about the eye the series of the optics baffles me it makes to my mind how great our mighty God is you see God designed the eye in such a way that even if the eye has a has a problem has a tissue it should be able to heal itself it should be able to regulate itself yes that is status the original design but our normal design discover that this is not so let me give you an example if somebody has an injury said to the cornea the cornea is the first refractive surface of the eye is the part that covers the the blood of the eye if there's an injury to the cornea do you know within 24 hours the cornea heals itself these cells will regenerate and he said that God has designed it to be and that's how the eye works in life in the reasons of its he doesn't happen that way why because I know the line wrong maybe due to infection you find I doesn't hear complication constant before you know it they say the person has Konya OSA you know all sorts of things can just  but in the absence of maybe other opportunistic infections or diseases you just discover that the eye on its own if somebody has say a very infection or a bacterial infection or something all those stuff you discover that if there is no other underlying conditions even within theory for this the eye we heal itself because the I had is for natural ability it has its own immunity it has its full capacity to rearrange and restructure and make sure that these functions optimally for when the immunity either your body in the eye is weak you discover that's just a simple problem - the idea comes down I make sure that were able to at least we're able to rest or to be with God you know once I did to be we can at least try who is significant Eston will be able to you know do that so there are some do's and don'ts we should try to avoid an order and then as part of the things we need to consider when we are talking about you know I care tips for the year we need to look at our family history if we have to in a family where people have eye problems or people wear glasses it's only wisdom for you as a father to make sure that your own children you don't go for Czech pop as an issue so that they don't have the problems you have now we have noticed that in families glaucoma can be transferred can be heritage and many of the eye problems my dear sister 90% of them be inherited if somebody is short-sighted if if a grandfather was shot I think it's possible that the son to up to deterred but generation it just passes on so once we know our family history we also know how to you know look at the eye problems that are common and then we should also understand through that age Matis science have shown that with increasing age your vision naturally widows average we don't really know why that is so well if we also look at it against the Bible even if you look at Isaac the Bible says his eyes was dim and order with age so as one is advancing in age last year you were 40 this year you are 41 just know that you're going to be having more visual complications yeah if you were able to read some things when you were 40 not I got 41 you are four three - three what if I it might be more difficult for you to read tiny printed materials why because the age is advancing and also at about that age of 42 you also discovered that many a mate's pump into the body does a body type people start noticing that they're hypertensive they have diabetes and all that the same thing with the eyes people starts some eye problems we just start manifesting it wasn't that developed with pasteurized a from 40 50 60 as the age goes on Tom glaucoma is just discovered that the pressure in the eyes before me watch some you know presbyopia does difficulty really tiny prints so with increasing age there's a tendency what your vision to reduce but because of that fact you need to you know rearrange your medical checkup to include ik' as part of your routine or the egg what lesson is that you shouldn't wait on - you have a problem with your eyes before you go for a routine check now see with respect to age from the time a child is born the eye is developing the vision is differentiating so from zero maybe to six months - why air to three until eight the time the child starts primary school the child's vision is expected to be checked in the Nigerian optometric Association we recommend that once a child is born the eyes should be checked when the child is 6 months the eyes should be checked when a child is born here the eyes should be checked when the child is 3 years the eyes should be checked when the child is five ones who enter primary warn I know that the eyes too should be checked and then as the child moves from one class to another there should be a visual assessment because well we have also seen that these days the kind of objects children do in school they are a lot more than what we did in our own days so there are a lot of visual exposures so this children to their eyes should be checked to know that the our vision is able to carry what they have been taught in school now let me also quickly put this in that there is a relationship between how well a child sees and how well it does in school yes a relationship between good vision and academic performance many of the children who are not doing well in school Oh even some of them that dropped out you discover that when you check some of them have visual impairments that you know was not detected was not treated and as a result of that the child dropped out of school so have any performance and vision they go hand in hand so we need to also understand that that that should be a possible reason for us to you know have Goods and tips ikat tips for this new year that is not just only for us as pyramid also for our children right you know we have too many schools out there put private and public now is it right now that government should look into that in all schools now if you have like maybe like a day or two that they can check they can follow exactly yes to check precisely let me talk about the course it's because it is already doing that in fact some years ago they did some survey the legacy blindness Prevention Program if you even check on the our website you see some of the statistics that some children have actually dropped out of school because of visual problem not necessarily because they are do indigo say they have what the coefficient corridor what they can easily used to just assess it right and then from time to time we have what is called to vision screening now for us in my own Association as optometrist and for myself as you know the chairperson of women optometrists in Nigeria llegaste chapter we go to schools we talk to parents we talked to mothers days needs to have your children's eyes examined and then in the developed world is compulsory school vision screen is composed ring as the child moves from one class to the other the vision is assessed they want to move is this child vision adequate to what the child is going to make you want to give this child 15 subjects at age ten or eight to study candy visual ability carrots and then we have also say from statistics that much of what a child lays before the age of say 10 or 12 is true the visual system about 80% of it that's why where you go to maybe a motor sorry schools or primary school uses so many colorful things you see pictures you see different colors because it's what the child can visualize that we see but much a da Ayda may not be able to resume as we originally as adults but what they see do easily go along yes so vision is is very key so other schools that I'm not taking you orders this they are not taking you they should actually you know take in human to make sure that these children's eyes are checked and beyond just the academic walk prevention we have always said is better thank you at our points many of the eye conditions can be picked and treated on time and then a whole lot of diversity I if it can be averted because we have picked it on time let me also tell you that most I problems will give you better prognosis when detected le when you touch just like cancer if you detect cancer le you have a better prognosis you understand the same thing with high conditions so at childhood when we are able to detect them le is you you have a better mm prognosis when treating now aside that to I also want to say that for adults maybe who have things like diabetes or hypertension they should also watch it they should be careful because diabetes affects the eyes hypertension truth affect the eyes so if you're an adult you've been diagnosed with diabetes or you know a child should ask juvenile diabetes whatever the age also are diagnosed with diabetes we actually say that you have corresponding eye examinations as you are treating the diabetes because so far diabetes is one of the causes of irreversible loss of vision yes so they cost a lot of damages to the part of the I decided I will called the posterior part the retina you know so a lot of damages can actually go on a condition I'll call diabetic retinopathy or hypertensive retinopathy Conoco actually for diabetic patients as you are taking your drugs you are doing your diets you are monitoring your blood sugar level please also go for or responding eye examinations and then I've also noticed us people who don't control their blood sugar very well they keep changing glasses even when they wear glasses for instance if a diabetic worried sugar level is low today the glasses might be okay by tomorrow it's high the glasses is no longer okay so a friend that I they keep coming back to the USA Oh doctor I can no longer sing with my glasses or you know my glasses are blood and all that so it's very important as much as possible for a monetary any the systemic image we should understand that they affect the eyes and for most diseases to the eye is frequently the best organ that they will tell on that's why most time you go for maybe you have malaria you want to see your GP he's checking your eyes is opening your eyes to see the eye is the window to the body you know so most emails will first of all show in the eye doctors you know we always see all these things coming out from your eyes so you need to take proper care of your vision you need to take proper care of your eyes so that all these image will not damage your eye now holistically let's look at some of the tips again we have talked about some of them before number one we said you shouldn't put toxins into your eye this new year let me for my practice I have seen so many things ooh I once had a mother that brought the child the child had what we called bacterial conjunctivitis does this child redness on order instead of bringing this child for checkup she decided to apply a potage on the eye you know that's what a lot of this before apply apply potash and then before you knew it the cornea started scaring the choice variable corneal scarring I wanted Connie I scarred it becomes difficult for you to see just at that point she brought the child to the clinic and we're like oh what is wrong with your son's eyes say oh the I was ready discharged and the neighbor advice I should put potage in water and puts it in the eye and it's with clay and all that and before you knew it the egg was damaged so don't put toxins in your eye if you have been doing that please disease remains this new year there are so many things people put I've had people mechanics determine that they put petrol in their eyes yes that when the ice ready does put petrol and he gonna class off and I'm like wow they put you in I mean hi some say hubs they put some hubs and you know last time talk about breast milk yes me well medically we don't support all that we see if you must put anything in your eye let's see just be your eye drops are you just used water to wash and all that we don't my son in fact that maybe your neighbor did it it worked for him does not mean I will try to walk away I don't know the science behind all these things so please aspect of our eye care tips for the new year make it a point of duty not to put anything in your I don't put toxins in your eye and then another thing we have also found our common Lisa people wear other people's glasses yes I have sometimes some couples they just come and say I'm wearing my wife's closet see well see I'm using my smart glasses subsidize my college classes and easy to read I know that we don't advise that don't use other people's glasses don't use other people's eye drop eyedrops are medications and the fact that has been prescribed for you doesn't mean that it suits someone else and that people are so in the habit of saying oh I had this problem doctor prescribe this eye drop for me don't wanna show you the unable go to Tammy's Guam run by semi-dry the same thing I give you an example I had a 34 year old a man who came to my clinic I saw the time he came he wasn't seen he was just lady I'm like what happened he said hey the I was red they never said it was a Clemens close to his house so he bought an eye drop I was applying initially West are there Plato's okay after some penalties I wasn't seen again and when I checked the eyes I discover that the cookies were completely dilated hundred percent then it says away the eye drop will be using my tell me brought the eye dropper or shorter so why how hmm you understand you see there are some eye drops that are meant to be used in a clinic they are not really for everyday use and n even if it authorized me to prescribe for use on that strict's a compliance or guidance you see just what's and I try I don't want to mention the name decant dilates the puppy I was a puppy was Lolita I couldn't see but turns out that lists were able to restore the side by constricting back people pick I would like this is not is no good right if you must apply an eyedropper high I mean go to your doctor yeah symmetric cleanings are too expensive I say so which one is better the blood chief or the Syrian a doctor too so if you don't have money for private clinic go to it general so sweet exactly well at least look for look for a doctor and an optometrist that would be your friend or your family physician I just wanted a very deem that they are doing that I like so much a lot of great social responsibility in my a my my province for example there's hardly any one month that won't give you opportunity to have their eyes examined in my own province for instance who have standby clinic that ok if you have questions you have issues they have doctors on granda you can just go on with the US Army if it's beyond what it can do they refer you we don't know for such opportunities instead of just you know try to do things on your own and at the end of the day you are doing more harm to yourself than good so please we should try to avoid you don't join all that and then we also encourage people last time that issue eats food food it's enough carrots yes yes foods rich in antioxidants and antioxidants labayda wood antioxidant to go it look for it there are foods that you know have good antioxidant now most time you find them in green leafy vegetables and fruits so you should make that part of your diet and distance to they also better em eating or better absorb when is eating raw for instance if you eat your vegetable salad row you get more benefits from it there are when you boil you fry and all that so at least if you try like the chakras we always say we should blend yes those practices they are good and then as you advance in age to you should reduce certain things for instance consumption of beef if you stop or reduce there are setting all these artificial foods as much as possible we should try to stay away from them we should be as close to nature as possible this will help our general body health and it also have our eye health it's a sometimes mistake some people make is that they think the is in isolation the eye is part of your body if your body is healthy your eyes too will be healthy so ensure that you keep your body healthy when your body that's beautiful that's a good tip for the year all right our time is fast friends and

that you know when the eyes infected either by bacterial viral or any kind of organism but once the eyes red and is discharging we say the person has a pollute actually the optometry temper is a bacterial conjunctivitis viral conjunctivitis fungi and other depending on the organism dies that is consonants in some other countries they call it pink eye yes so once that happens the truth is like I said Elliot will go does design the eye in saw study I can heal itself of whatever a means when days are pollute even without you treating it's the I supposed to heal heal itself we they may be two three days supposed to clip off but if it doesn't play off then you should seek a and when you do that the doctor will examine you and determine the kind of organism that is causing it and they based on that will give you eyedrops or advise you on hygiene especially ocular hygiene and hand hygiene most understanding go with you know that the environment I know that the infections so once that is done the eyes completely treated okay can an eyebrow be kept for use if yes or out long if you look at instruction or your eye drops said I've when you open after four weeks you discard the maximum size I use an eye drop is four weeks after that you discard where the eye drop is finished or not you discard and then when you are apply your eye drop you don't allow the tip to touch your eyes you just turn and press somebody can help you and then there are some eye drops you put in the fridge to keep the temperature level so that the active ingredients will be kept active so you have to thank you for calling all right thank you what he said is using eyeglasses because his eyes are very sensitive to light we call that condition food - for beer most time some people cannot just stand light so there are certain medications that you can use to correct it add a form of eye drops or glasses or setting advise that the person can be given on what to do some regulations and things like that so I advise that he should continue to wear his glasses because he just happened to fall into that category of being sensitive to light not everybody would have the same degree of sensitivity to light we are all sensitive to light what degree varies for different people so we call such lenses transition lenses or sometime we can add what you call anti reflux to eat and then ask for supplements they are fighting about them out there as you have no your attention consult your doctor base of your I need Z can't recommend for you or you can't call me later I can't Zeno's send it test to you on song

best you can manage that condition because the condition I will keep or Corinne and reoccurring though you don't need to be discouraged and we don't want your eyes to be damaged if you don't treat alright so on ask a question please explain diabetes affecting the eyes and solutions yeah yeah yeah diabetes is one of the major systemic problems that affect the eyes you know diabetes is chronic is the conditional you manage throughout life well as the years of diabetes increases from maybe from the time you were diagnosed maybe two years three years five years ten years the higher you've been treating that diabetes is the more the damage that tend to occur in the eye and a condition called diabetic retinopathy hello Co Adam is that your diabetes is affecting your retina the internal part

here this is the right here so this is a two twelve o'clock three o'clock six and nine o'clock we can see that there is a tort which has been used by the previous surgeon and which has been positioned from the tympanic membrane to the food plate but you can see that the distal tip is not connected to the foot plate which means that the table is too short so we have to change that you can see the position the location of the of the distal tip of the shoe which is not in contact with the foot plate so that is the first point so we need to dissect this this the distal tip Trotter shook and I will of course change the procedures on what yang dong said portes NEPA on ba on contact avec la platoon waste is 50 bulky TC de sac Papuan sweet whatever the Patels for achievement on supporters

check the stay peaceful plate what already Testament on a plate single a three-year and absolutely stop marry brookie this is fixed that the stay peaceful plate is fixed so definitely the previous procedures was also too short and position on a fixed footplate we can see that there is some chimpanzee erotic force in here on the promontory which means that this foot plate was fixed by simple

state it autumn a procedure but the first step is to dissect the Mallee sandal we have a pretty narrow external auditory canal because it's a five only a five millimeter diameter speculum whatever I don't could have a human or a mock to table nervous it would be what it cover you don't stop blue permeable sleep opera super high tempo if I smell how many on Xavier for computer damn nail told her that legendary three year so you can see the Mary sandal here so I'm going to leave the matter dinkus first I mean I keep the increase in position it helps for the dissection of the malleus angle well I don't meant not in the seek a limit to the first wah-wah receiver hey you temple so I'm performing this period still flap so I made an incision and I'm dissecting the Maddie's candy no man I'm here at the level of the Ambo which always be more tricky to dissect because the adherence to the Ambo is more important always well champagne they save you the cicada party distract you turn up a pure start Wow my place County to rock the party disturb him I've totally empty purpose that they want ready 6220 pebility see voila here we go African anomalies handle is totally separated from the tympanic membrane made maybe a little bit here adherents at the level of the neck of the menus and the short process this is your pick whereas France Canadian - on German separates math to convert water on the other here can a significant return on the ball a finality to 35 so created this world I come for a waffle needed the rest of the dough vain may manifest Ramallah honor here Roxy Buffy Korea don't meant no no no Sabri direct play so the next step for the marriage relocation as usual is to cut the tenth attempt and I tendon possible Shiva using a 90 degree knife like this why are you commenting on your sweet reality reduction any mother lap which shows that's giveaway well now what you don't Matt no don't cream so I removed the incus now the second obstacle which is really completely eroded ah - oh no cost again okay well so we should be able to remove it now okay and now I will relocate the marriage in the tone value of a position near enough to when I'm not out order at that indirectly okay can they see the play Croesus mara when I'm in no claw enough to contact you ten points so you see I'm sticking the marriage to the tympanic membrane and I will not measure the distance from the marriage to the step is footplate in order to determine the procedures length when preparing for tests total simply filter flow so we are just in front of the second notch which means six millimeter so I will cut approach the six point five seven limit cycle can be memo to zero play mm-wha stop so we do now this tape autonomy with the laser first and then the micro drill so we've a prized the footplate now with the diet laser don't convert it above a probably repeat in the red here right okay and now I will use the macro drill to perform this de patata me voila oh my don't go terminator we are trio D'Amico Dora Platt Cinderella del amico feather I can but it's why the set agenda many media met so as usual this is no point seven millimeter diameter diamond Desborough with the circle on the left which is also zero point seven millimeter diameter sucker okay now it's done here we go and now I will put the vein over the staple army to seal the labyrinth robin o'kelly place a revetment no European doofus monsieur la protecci\u00f3n durrani antenna okay so now we need to cut the procedures at the corresponding length which is six point five millimeter you remember that I measured the distance and the distance was six but we have to take into account the deepness of the groove of the procedures head here made in the hydroxyapatite which is 0.5 so I always add 0.5 which means 6.5 total well you see we met second said I don't go the report is over the co-payment no I refute on Teflon if you cut the same the minimal and at that only dogs Appetit well grease a pseudo motto and after box okay and ooh well we don't come near the Phillip Hotel des Beaux don't forget your party case so we need to place the tool to introduce the shaft within this tape autonomy here like this here we go and now we need to place the marriage within the roof that one avanti proceed we'll play stop and make so I will use a hook in a second to grab the marriage while I'm going to introduce the marriage within the groove now Riley at what you don't come back to Don oh gosh then of course that Ted to set photos a weekly few a Placido gone where - pattycake at Rivera plates in especially okay it's done we can see that now the Maldives handle is located within the groove I'm going to place it at a distal tip here and you can see the vertical position of this prosthesis which is an important point to have a better result in terms of prosthesis efficiency you see that now we have the shaft very flexible I'm not sure we can have access to the run window because the run window dish is on the right here and hidden by bone don't think there is any little bit we can see a little bit of a round window here I'm not sure we can see anything because it's pretty dark let me see now impossible to see that the the membrane is deeper so it's fine but anyway we can see that now the shaft is located inside the stay patata me and nurse Italy what I don't care let's be sure my behavior to that face at is for zona one bond ability to diffuse the appetizer active and be in Italy in protest here Rubeus oncology where you can transmission to - a gas away and turn mm-wha stop as I can't see the round window sign I'm going to try to check the position of the shaft that's important to see that what you see that now I'm stretching the vein and you see that the shaft is well placed you see the bending sign that we have here which means that everything looks fine still don't see maybe I can see a little bit of a movement if I can do it now with the light here yes it's moving well voila don't play Oh 932 Dora bond position the report s dr. Robert met know the tempo Allah Padukone you read if X 10 so now I will replace the the flap you see that the position of the medicine Hall is connected with the tympanum to the con to the tympanic membrane this is this is absolutely fine I'm replacing now of the flap and see how it is at the end we need to check that several times to be sure that everything stays in place you see it stays in the vertical position so we're placing the drum and now checking again and now everything is fine well I don't that divorce wait a minute metal plasmid no inputted mesh don't convict on what your heart pencil would be Coachella Oh second weight on his mana which are how second jewel a vacant with your thumb really zeroed on man see that your CMOS a shocker the result are all genuine empathy media energy density due to a constituent too complex for cancerous a calico cement wall member Fattah el corazon por aqui Nova result was a mob Bambino pre complete para su di giotto merci beaucoup", "_mpTE8Vt4Ys": "by then the - eNOS I would like started an apology regarding - hesitancy about the framing to the whole the events of last minute I hope we can be excused I would like to welcome you all to dr. scorching desert lecture entitled standing stones of medieval mafia energy dualism and simple in pre-op consultants dr. fortune bazaar was born in available in 1984 he attended partner school in Los Lunas Sabrina operation and journey and completed here secondary school education in the UK in 2003 he was awarded the Oxford student scholarship which enabled him to study quality and German at the University of Oxford where to achieve the highest results of here as the final aggravation after initially returning to 7 billion 2007 in 2009 she started his renee and later and in magnitudes at your university in toronto canada where you will be awarded lower canada premier graduate scholarship one of the which was one of the most prestigious of graduate scholarships awarded by the canadian government after completing his PhD in 2003 he returned variable working our director of the Montessori coalition and teaching as international at the International University of Ariel psycho field arts and social science and social and political sciences program for which I am the program coordinator and the professor incentives were published and involving Canadian and German journals while his lyrical let's say the stones of gems stream flows included in the selection of the best Canadian essays 2013 I would like to welcome dr. Norton to start onyomi hall thank you very much for the nice introduction and also for the invitation and opportunity to speak here today and thanks to hold you who made it today to my lecture especially my students so I will try to give you a kind of condensed version of my PhD dissertation hence the title which was the same the same title my dissertation and what I will be talking about our this so called standing stones of medieval Bosnia it's actually one name I I gave in this name in English normally in Bosnia we call this spaceship which actually means the same thing and in stone and it's also relation to the wider phenomenon of standing stones which we can find in different countries all over Europe such as Ireland and also ancient France etc and three the subtitle heresy dualism in symbols it refers to the three analytical categories through which I approach this rather difficult topic and as we will see in this presentation so let you start with a very basic question what is this spanning stone or the state check that I'm talking about here are some different names that we use in audience con logic normal Billy so as you can see basically what they are they are kind of white we can call them simple stone structures that we can find scattered all over the countryside so this is probably the main characteristics that they always you know out outside in underneath you know under the sky so to speak which already is quite different from the usual type of grey stone that was not good in this period in medieval Europe because they were mainly constructed in the interiors of churches and another characteristic is that they're monolithic which means they're all constructed from one single local stone so and also it's just a simple block rather than for example you may be aware about ancient Roman nose or culpably that have a similar shape however they usually hollowed out with the bones of the deceased being put in in some and these are the different is the very short simple introduction of the different shapes in which we can find in the special stones and mainly really need or I see more hypothetical by the main shapes are here from Oracle 21 so the really three basic forms that we can find out behind a flat stone that are quite common actually in the context of medieval Europe many larger like long rectangular blocks and then was only the most famous shape and if you are somebody about this nature they will think of this shape and being safe so kind of house shaped monolithic stone with although here you can see many engravings in fact when you look at the totality of Delta standing stone most of them don't have any decoration and so it's only valid around 20% of their detect any kind of decoration and finally this like shape also the specific types of crosses which we normally call usually they're so-called anthropomorphic crosses because the outer part is rounded so it makes me resemble the more a human figure rather than that it's an added shape of the cross and if we look at the kind of romantic Matt goes back to the 1960s which was the last time when a systematic survey of all the station stones were carried out and they should definitely be done again but this is what we have for now and each dot represents one the confluence of these stones so I mean what you can quite clearly see immediately that they are all centers around most of the territories of modern very important index ago we know what the greatest thing to be in the region of hurt the organized here is Easter for Nia however they're not just limited to modern-day Bosnian you know we can old the pilot along the Dalmatian coast in parts of Montenegro and also here in modern-day Serbia and based on this last survey we have a number of approximately 65,000 stone which is really you know the most impressive fact about this - no no because no other country in Europe has such a large number of surviving tombstones from from the medieval period however if we look more into their actual historical context so when the majority of the stones there were erected which is the period of the 14th and 15th centuries this is a theory of iron in the most of the territories were governed by the medieval Bosnian state which in the 14th century also became a kingdom and it's here you can see the borders when it was at its greatest extent under the king foot or cultural image and again if you think of the previous map extinct it's quite the obvious fact I would say that the territory based or the phenomenon of the stature can be primarily linked to the most medieval in Spain and now we will come to some more details you look at the stone so how do we actually know for example when they erected at some more basic facts unfortunately there haven't been any large-scale systematic archaeological excavation of the stone so that we will have more precise information and within this situation our most reliable swords are actually the inscription which you can see here and they're very rare so from the total number of more than 65,000 stones only about 300 has some very short inscriptions written in in the medieval Bosnian language which is also and in the script which we coordinate Cyrillic sometimes the presumption says oh it's a type of super Cyrillic but with some specific characteristics apply to the area of open air and this this this particular stone is very interesting actually you can see this original International Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina and it is particularly interesting because it named the person who is buried underneath and it is ghost Middleton and this title of ghost allows us to to link this particular stone to to the medieval Bosnian Church which is where we will come to this I mean we could have a whole lecture or a series of lecture just on the question of what the medieval Bosnian church but what we know for sure is that there was this independent institution which had its own kind of title to not have exact in the same titles as the calculate golden abstractions and one of the highest dignitaries of the boolean search was called ghost so this was his particle and here we actually see a representation of this dignitary of the Bosnian church with - as we call in iconography attributes so things that are attached to one person and live in a way identify this person or say some important things about about his status and role and one thing is holding is a book and this we can presume that this is the Bible that he's holding because in this area that little part of the main character because of the Bosnian church that they insisted on reading the actual text of the Bible and translating it into the local language which was not the practice within the Catholic Church of this of this period and also he's holding a walking stick which also shows a characteristic of then of the Bosnian church and dignitaries that they were not attached to once picked the location but they were as as we call it they'll itinerant so they were going around and headed into the needs of their of their communities and so now we come just to this really complicated question as I already said to the possible connections between the special stones and the Bosnian Church and there are many different their price serious arguments about this issue and they I will just like kind of quickly go through the main issues without going into detail to provide an answer so the main question that we're facing when we studied about nature is whether it was and we call it neo manichaean preference or just a schematic or primitive form of of the Christian Church and neo Manichean pattern means that it belonged to completely separate trend of of Christianity that was quite different from the development of Catholic and Orthodox Church or was it made very similar that this would be the other theory that it wasn't quite very similar to to the Orthodox churches as it was just Lisa's agnostic so separated inner in the kind of organizational structure the second question that we face when we ask what our distinction so who where they produce five and three possible answers and Benjamin that it was model professional so that it was directed only by members of the Bosnian church the second one is inter-confessional which means it was directed by all three communities or church structures in the vehicles near which were the Orthodox of the Catholic and Bosnian church or something actually that I suggested my theory that it was super confessional so that it was actually that there was a kind of as we can call it NOLA no in Bosnian Christianity that was then secondarily divided eventually into the different confessions and finally the question is when you look at the symbols and the depiction that I will look at in a few moments are they sacred spiritual so do do these symbols actually have some kind of religious level of significance or are they nearly secular continued and then for example if we see a hunter hunting a stag is this simply a representation of the everyday lives of the people or does it have some kind of religious and simple levels of significance and I will just briefly have to cover this very complex issue of the Bosnian church in before we come to the ex of actual energy of the stones so we often here and this would be the traditional history right immune that the Bosnian church was a dualist heresy and what could this mean so the word heresy it comes from the Greek I this is which originally meant choice so this word comes from the ancient Mediterranean world the Roman Empire when there was there were many different religions coexisting at the same time and the word heresy simply meant choosing one of these religions and eventually came to mean a party or a school of choice however over a long period with the rise of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire eventually would be heresy would mean an opinion chosen by human perception country the Holy Scripture publicly about and obstinately defending so eventually heresy was defined as something that is explicitly considered as wrong so so that all there was only one one right way of thinking and one right way of believing and they were angered in that won't even accordance with that was described as a heresy and here we have what was actually a legal definition of heresy this period so there are many different components which I will just briefly read so the spreading and following of old belief and interpretation of the Bible that is not in accordance with the Roman Church adoration from the sacraments simile which means buying of church services and position publicly spread out in religion and it slices this agreement dog speech so this is really important it means that if somebody has even the tiniest disagreement with the official idea of Christianity it was the old sin which opens the denial of the papal jurisdictional privacy so if there were in the tiny disagreement you could be accused of heresy in this period and the punishment was being a burden to Tibet in this period so it was a very considered as a very serious crime and if we take this very strict definition of heretics period we can say for sure that in Bosnia we did have a heresy at this time because we have many documents where the poles explicitly said that you know the Bosnian Christians do not adhere to the rites version of Christianity what about Judaism also [Music] also very complex issue that I will just briefly touch on here so dualism is usually defined as the belief that the universe was created or endured is governed by two divine beings so there's not just one god but there are two gods who can send it insect in different kinds of relationships to each other so they can either be equal or they can be one eye Alton Utley wants to bring God with which one with one inferior and the interesting thing is that when we think about it it's actually very difficult to separate dualism from also monotheistic religions because we have particularly Christianity the very strong role of stationing in the material world so there are definitely elements of dualism but historically it goes back to this who usually is considered that the original dualistic religion was Zoroastrianism in in ancient Iran mention peridot but then over time and she needs these movements that we have in medieval Europe in content resources they're most commonly described as neo mauna kea and mauna kea ism was also a religion that originated in modern-day iraq which was part of the persian world and which also adhere to a kind of heuristic worldview which basically means that it considered the main kind of theological point there is that the material world was governed on I just Evil Dead Sea orbits been equated with with Satan and here we have actually links that have been documented so we have content documented testified a there were these links that are shown with these arrows of course there are scholars who disagree with this it's possible to argue that these sources were painted they were not well informed but if we look at how contemporary Europeans of this time describe the appearance of these movements that they considered as heresy they said that it originally came from Lille on the manikins and then through the collisions who were religious movement emerged there in in the early medieval Armenia and both against the Byzantine Empire for a long time and then influence the organelles in Bulgaria and devolve imelda turn influence with diversity intact ours is and in this region the south west of modern-day France actually became very powerful in the 4th century so that the Catholic Church organized the crusade the famous crusade against the kappahd women where were killed and ultimately this this belief is destroyed and was just missing from this map is the name Katherine so initially and also in fact in Bosnia they were using up all this and you still remain what today we you may hear that believable here we have over meals strictly eating this is not the right here we do not encounter the servants in in Bosnia usually they describe as utterance so same as the Italian heretics of dispute and now we come to the question sergeant really covered its religious complexities of the environment and then we come to the question so we have been images on on the stones and how how do we go about actually interpreting them how do we know what what they were meant to represent or on the worst kind of structure and this is a very complex issue because if we look at the history of the Christian attitudes towards visual arts it's actually there have been many different and it on clicked with the most famous one being of course the iconoclastic conflict where for a period of over 100 years there was something as a kind of civil war within the Byzantine Empire between one side and support the demanding of religious images and another sided supportively usage of all religious images and eventually over time what the churches the official breeches developed the justification why art should be so why should it be allowed even though the Bible is quite clear that you know you should make images of the gods etcetera so there was something feeling that I have heard the propagandistic conception of art and if we find many sources in the medieval period where the church actually justifies using images or three reasons as a Bible for different so if you haven't read the Bible you can look at the images and churches as an arousal of emotions so if you see these dramatic images of Jesus actually will develop religious emotions and and as an aid to memory so it will be easier to remember religious religious fruits and however why I look for alternate business as you will see in a moment as soon as you look at this page of imagery it's clear that it does not really fit this this image because it doesn't show any kind of biblical image or imagery doesn't show any of the standard images that could be considered you know Bible unruly truth but if if they have some meaning that clearly you had to I don't know how to interpret them you have to receive a specific key in which you can read the images so that might look alternative and in fact there is a different idea about what are served and goes back to ancient Greece and this is what I call the mystical conception of art and many thinkers with it it comes from from the philosophical movement of Neoplatonism and was eventually taken up in Christianity and the idea was if it is the kind of art or the purpose of art is not let he depict nature and physical images but to point towards higher tools towards religious ideas and towards if you want to incur the kind of difference that I mentioned and this is what I kind of approach the imagery of the special place and as I kind of try to make a combination of these two I what our argues is that the images manuals would necessarily have only one meaning so it's possible that maybe as I mentioned the background for one person it could represent a simple 800 everything wild for those who were sufficiently religiously educated they could have you know they could have additional specific layers of meaning as it was the case also for example in the ancient Christian world when the early persecuted Christians had to hide their beliefs because because of the persecution of the Roman Church so now I actually come to to dispatcher's themselves and their imagery and the first thing I want to briefly discuss is the style in which they would carve so as you can see here in one of the most famous when the images of of this patient even those very rare it's kind of strange this this type of symbol with the right rate right hand appears only or maybe six or seven stone but it's become an iconic rock of this entire art and what you can see mediately is that it's a very flat way of carbon so the images are not carved three dimensionally but in both in what's holding in history of art also the like of the flats really so very shallow type of engraving and why would that what many scholars us or they're simply you know they were not able technically they did not know how to carve better images but I and here we are just to compare with the style in that we find in Western Europe in the same period I will not go into the iconography now which is also very different what is depicted as you can see in this period in Western Europe we already have three-dimensional sculpture which for a long time was completely forbidden in in Christianity and I go to so why did these differences appear and is it simply a question of technical skill I just think I think it actually has reasons there are religious let's call the reasons for this to show just why I mean actually one church which maybe some people from 30 may recognizes the church on Lake and Armenian churches and located in any lake bond on the island of optim-r and it's from the 8th century and if you look at the way the images are carved on this on this church you see that it's a similar style with the flat forehead that some not they didn't use a three-dimensional actress either and this was precisely for that reason that I already listed that three-dimensional sculpture was and almost forbidden within Christianity as it is also for example in his marvel still today and and this is also so for a long time the Armenian art was actually characterized by this flat Lex I love Carling and in fact this is my own photograph when I visited there a few years ago and I made that and something that's not really well-known in or not known at all in in our historical Valley but they actually have some stones that look very similar to the specter and I think that this goes back to also a longer tradition but essentially and even today it's unfortunately not my photograph I didn't visit western China are you people but still today they use each type of great stone that in a way in its basic conception seemed to have some similarities with the house and stone and I'm just going to these quite different example because in medieval Europe we think we cannot find this same Bibles also they must have a different origin also it down it and something that looks possibly releases this tradition also a link that you will see later this particular symbol which appears very frequently on only for the into instance and now I come to the actual iconography of what the types of symbol that we find on this page ourselves and there is a lot of debate about the cross and the cross is the most frequent symbol found on the stones that something that maybe sometimes not not familiar how often you will get always saying that sums qualitative because you can see the cross on on the stones it means that could not have belonged to the Bosnian Church or any kind of these so-called heretical movement because there are many documents in which observers say that the heretical movement they did not accept the symbol of the cross so the argument is if you have the cross it cannot belong to the Bosnian Church however I mean the first thing we know this is despite many different shapes of the crosses that we find and I showed all the few of them here in fact there is a really noticeable absence and that is the crucifixion because if you look at Western and also Eastern Christian art of this period the crucifixion of Jesus on the cross is the most common shape and we can never find this shown on the statute stones and if we actually go through the contemporary sources they talk about the volume air pollution a skewed towards the broad process it is one original document from entrances then the patriarch said again why do you not believe in an order of the precious cross he said an innocent infidel not worship and angry the precious and life-giving cross by cross in a Christ making across by holding out the arms so what this shows is that the polices and the government did accept the cross but it was a symbol of Christ and safety Christ making across so it was the gesture of spreading out the arms of Jesus rather than the idea of his crucifixion and it is very important and our learning for the whole conception of of their attitude and not their understanding of the role of Jesus as as a divine as a divine messenger and this acts cute you know that's why it's important to think about the disturb heresy because usually we we mean heresy or actually we are inherited something that's wrong with its distinct but if we look at many of these attitudes in fact these so called heretical attitudes are much closer to original Christianity then you later execute all of the Orthodox churches and here's just one example just in March one of the earliest Christian theologians from the third century he talks about why the cross is important for poor Christians and it's not you never mentioned that if he doesn't mention the crucifixion of Jesus but he said consider all the things in the world whether without this form it could be administered or had any community and a human form differs from any rational animals and nothing else it is being erected having the hands extended etc so what you saying is that the cross is actually an abstract symbol that we have it intimately tied to the human being so whether human spread out their arms then you get the cross holes and the phase between the nodes at the eye and so so the cross was understood much more as a mystical symbol rather than as a depiction of of the crucifixion of Christ and just if I go back to this shape which is one of the more original lesson shapes of the cross boundaries every stone at least on my research and never come across this type of cross in any other context in the Christian world and it and also as you can see it actually had maybe it's not so clearly visible but it's type of cross with oil and their grapes growing out of these spirals and this can also be explained through actually something that that we can find in the Bible itself where joint quotes Jesus saying I am The True Vine and my father is the gardener etc etc so Jesus compares himself to through divine and his branches and what's interesting about this topic is that it mentioned the word clean already clean because of the word I have spoken to you and in the original Greek the word for clean is Castle castle oil and the Cathars of the related movement that I talked about in the South of France was named Cathars and and they existed on the value on the significance of of purity and internal cleanliness and here the second symbol that we will look at is the aura that actually appears a lot more frequently on the spectrum stones and then this shape with the human being with only one ring and so the oranges what we made this particular shape so human being with both arms great higher and sometimes they feel like this but the single one sometimes only had between other figure in detector so it appears in many I think more than 100 cases and what is actually the orange where does this particular orange actually the word itself comes from Latin or other means to pray so it means the praying figure and if we go back to the earliest Christian are the detachments in in Rome it's the main symbols filled even it's older than the cross and most christian graves of this series are marked precisely by this figure the orange of the human being with with the ring hand and in fact we have also written evidence that this is this form in which were early Christians actually prayed this is one of the sourcing beholdeth Solomon that was forward that would looks included in the Bible they would use by many early Christian communities and it says I spend in my hands and hello my lord for the expansion of my hands is history so the sign of Lord design of Jesus Christ is precisely bastard amazing the raising of the arms and my extension is the upright across so we can also read the symbolism of the cross in this and this gesture of the reign times and what's interesting is that this image large largely disappears from Christian art around the 15th century we can only come back find the Virgin Mary or exceptionally some Saints the activities posture but never either normal Christians are excluded so average believers and then it appears again in medieval Bosnia which again shows that this artistic tradition which is my thesis has some some links to the earliest earliest Christian world and here just another example the the orange is not just a Christian simple is great the rain arm we can find in some of the oldest art resemblance and to Asia pictogram of Central Asia and many other religious traditions as well but an interesting one comes again from the Bible from the Old Testament the kind of almost somewhat the only part in where there is a battle between the Israelite and among kids and so as long as Moses as long as Moses was how they're holding up his arms like that the Israelites were winning and when put them down daily losing so what they did they actually like to other people when holding Erin her health and number one one type on one on the other so they haven't depend like that has enabled we Israel the Israel to Israelites to to carry out this act victoriously so here just a few more examples of the orange appearing on the stage of stones and I find this one is really interesting because it should it's one of those cases which we find often on on the stones but we cannot say for sure what one image represented as this actually represent an extra human here which raised arms or it is actually across all the kind of fusion between those two symbols he also one particular famous example from the Necropolis protein set where it clearly shows some kind of religious ceremony being carried out which is moving here and the rosette and somehow you know who need a communication with with higher horses the presence directly after the cross the most frequent image or symbol found on the special stone is depressing pen which is of course again quite unusual because the present is something we normally associate with Islam however it helped as much longer older tradition here and as far as I know this nobody has really managed to give a fully satisfactory information explanation for for this image was interesting is it mostly complete justice Christ and there are there are no process so when you have a crescent there is no cross and of course we can speculate you know the cross as masculine symbol the Crescent has a feminine but there is no no kind of evidence or no anomalous event to tell us why this crisis was was an important symbol and sometimes quite rarely but we find it also an in a combination of on with the cross so this is taken from the running a necropolis in so lots and one of the for me most interesting explanations or possible theories of the Crescent was given by important scholar Alexander solonius because he by the Manatee and his idea was that we can interpret this imagery through through manichaean ISM and what he said he found some sources they talk about the monarchy and belief that the moon or the Crescent was a shape of life transporting the souls of the deceased to the Otherworld because in this new human soul were considered to be fragments of life within the human here we have actually a one source ancient source of the continent of Salamis who talks about modern so we claim that they've the Sun the Moon and stars they pulled the souls of the deceased from the earth and Islamic great risk area turned into third life in the land of the West and just a general interest in parallel which may be related I mean I hadn't unfortunately managed to by now that much about the art of the mandiant Sir Roger obscure religious group that until recently existed only in Iraq where they survived since the early Christian times they were kind of Gnostic time so Christians and many of them were to occur to you that now move to to the United States and in their art we also find the mood and kind of massive representation of a  the Divine Being which I again represented in this exhibition if we will find on the special stones and one more particular image that I want to talk about which can be may be described as the most original contribution of special God art because at least that are as I know this particular follow it with although the circle dance is not really an important motif than any other artistic tradition that I look at and it's this it's shown on many different many different stones in various shapes so like in many figures with two fears we have also even did some kind of maybe representation of of the dance and what could this be of course circle dances are attested in many different traditions around the hills so often in many different traditions in the world they were they would carry out such dances during burials however we have a lot of evidence that this was actively persecuted in in Catholic Church from this area so it was considered an alien custom and not really Christian so so difficult to conclude that this could be thyroid heat propagated by by the Catholic Church of this period the only possible parallel in this period is a small team of the social dance macabre which we find in many European churches of this period and it is a kind of balance where people are holding hands but as you can I think I've ever seen me it was very different it has its telekinetic different representations of different human beings of different actually usually different classes so often you would have the king and then some Nobles and down to the lowest to the straight of societies and yet years was that that is a force that kind of level all social differences and it's a frequent motif in Catholic arts of this period but I think it there is no direct connection between these two I've looked for alternatives and again if we look at the earliest Christians and some of their apocryphal writings like the acts of john that were also banned eventually within the church we actually have one chapter called around dance of the cross so it was in fact one particular at least one version of Christianity hey with Ariel these types of groundouts and they were considered sacred ounces a little difficult to suggest the direct connection between the early agnosticism and the medieval voting in church but it's an indication that there may have been some kind of alternative perception of Christianity that that denotes use these most effective customs I will slowly reach the end just one more motif so this breathing of only two paces you see this down led by a stag which brings us to this next motif which is the stag or the deer also wanted to very freeze little T's pounds on on the facial bones and some scholars that simply have suggested that while they were just kind of view the Lord's and they like to go hunting and that's why they depicted icons on the tombstone I don't think this is very convincing theory but in fact we find it like on their own many times also as you saw before leaving this sacred down they also find solar symbolism in their antlers etc and even in at least one case we find something that would human being with with bags answers and what could it be again we can actually find any possible explanation within the Bible itself which can compare the dear will describe to to the surface yearning for God so as a deer pants for streams of water so my soul pants for you my god and this this idea is actually are frequently depicted in Christian art of the early Middle Ages here for example in Georgia in the seventh century we see very drinking from this well which probably represents this idea of the soul yearning for God however it's a much older symbol and this is just one of many examples again I already mentioned the Central Asian tradition of the skin tradition some of the oldest art in the world actually shows the sky one of the major symbols and it's believed that there was an association between the antlers and a certain shamanic think so so people who could communicate with higher forces which is perhaps so here in the soulful coolness for cauldron that was found in modern-day Denmark and is from the third century it's from the Celtic art and it shows the kind of presumably a spiritual figures rounded by animal been sitting in this faith and also with with stacks with editors as answers and how the question would be why would they do it if the stag really in some way represents a spiritual leader why would they represent his back hunt and here possible explanation is that again according to an ancient and early Christian belief one of the ideals of the early Christian would martyr them so to die for their faith and if they actually believe that if you want to be a true Christian you will inevitably come into conflict with with the dark forces of this world and in medieval only we know for a fact that the Bosnian Christians were actually persecuted many times so this add-on may actually be a symbolic representation of of the persecution of the true Christians okay as we're reaching the end soldiers the fleur-de-lys also very common symbol usually interpreted as taken over from the bullet in medieval coat of arms and again I'm not completely convinced because if you just want to show the coat upon Y or show the actual coat of arms Lord and then instead they represented the fluid is in these strange shapes that we call anthropomorphic it also had the possible spiritualist a religious explanation in that the fleur-de-lys was usually considered the symbol of the Virgin of the Virgin Mary in many traditions who usually had the title in the Christian world of Pentacles which means the god bear because she carried Jesus in her womb however in these alternative so-called theoretical traditions actually the true Christians were considered the carriers of God because the idea was if you lead a virtuous life if you if you know hold on to these rules and actually you know the Holy Spirit God dwells within each human being so this could also be made possibly to this idea of the two Christians as the carriers of dependence finally just for the end I want to point the rather sad fact that this election one's edge of necropolis located not far from Sarajevo and unfortunately even though recently some of them were included on the UNESCO World Heritage List the Bosnian state is not really you know paying any attention to them and then there became their being destroyed so probably we may be the last generation to be able to actually study study the stones systematically thank you yes yeah I have one person yet can you tell us more about the similarities or differences between Romeo and the part of what was me butter uttering and dull group in France yes well well in fact the Parliament life with the Bosnian church that we have almost no direct sources because they all destroyed so we don't have documents written by the pastor and or by the Cathar by themselves who say we believe this business I was always written by their enemies the Catholic Church who try to destroy it so we had unreliable sources but if we look at these sources they always describe them as very similar and all the medieval sources say that is utter and then the Cathars came from from a little area or from the Byzantine Empire so and there's one source which actually will say they're synonyms that they are the same that they're called alleles in the Byzantine Empire and utterance or are in the western world and we also have a direct evidence of communication and even involve yourself so we have some sources from Italy saying that some of these heretics actually came to Bosnia to learn more about the truth faith and for one period when all these movements were persecuted all over Europe Bosnia was the only country where they were tolerated and that's why his culture flourished more when already by the mid 13th century was pretty much destroyed in France and it only then developed fully in in Bosnia and I have to add they also time there was also crusade against Bosnia led by Hungary to try to destroy them but it was not successful so they did not manage to you know destroy this within in the 12th century and then in Florida school yes we are all the quarter is very steep discussion when he gave us the theoretical framework to explain what these meanings meet with a little bit literature's engage that I was worried about were working on article that was that Islam's opposition could Raven images and I'm looking at this couple wjt missile agility rosin explanation representations meaning making so how do you pray like familiar more general claim about what this stuff actually meant and I believe microstructural spreading workers in something more traditional well actually you know I started with it the more traditional iconography / - ology of another scheme which has a code which is a bit dated but you know I worked on one this the idea of three levels of meaning that he he proposed like natural level conventional level the symbolic level and then because I was concerned with with the Christian world I looked at reception practices in the in the Christian world but now I just one name is escaping me but when we finish ask me again and one very important yes so I will tell you in a few minutes a one option is durian apart which I found really you know very good it helped me to find some of my own theoretical frame very much people really collected it maybe some more life on like patent-eligible in church membrane cantilever experimentation comparable to influencers in one in terms of 300 a mandatory washing before training of any people yeah yeah this is also really I mean big question and in helping this idea also between not just similarities but the idea of direct links and there's a kind of explanation why was there became Islamic site quite rapidly is because of the similarity in my research I did I did not find such detail I mean there is no director historical evidence that you know this ideas I can't pray five times days are either no artisan and the washing but what I know I mean the main sources are it was a much stricter version than the standard Christianity so if you actually first of all they didn't baptize children that was considered meaningless but you could only become Christian at a certain age and when you follow some very certain rules however one of the most interesting ideas of these links is that there is this concept of the pirate's life energy the whole sometimes translated as the Holy Spirit and sometimes as the comforter which you find in the Bible and it's in these cool movements so called I was a theoretical they actually cited this parrot way to come you know to come back to to earth so they in some version they expected an additional a new messenger and then when it one came that Mohammed was represented as as this messenger and final message and it led to certain same uses of optical Union Church and Islam however it has to be added that sometimes this is used this uncritically that you know cynically the Ottoman Empire came and then those new Christians just couldn't wait to convert to Islam because they're so similar in fact if we looked at it objectively there were many different so the conversions when you can a different direction some some became also those some became Catholic some pathways between Muslim etc so if it's for the conflict issue that unfortunately not being sufficiently study them I consider it one of the biggest questions of holding a history and hopefully someone will educate themselves hi Mia oh you have one okay thank you for a little stretching lecture the call appears the wish figures call oh yeah were they from Vicky in Bosnia or from other regions I make actually most symbolism here to go in as much original incident imagery so most of these images are HD from of the Herzegovina region but they also appear in in Bosnia and eastern Bosnia to be different in there it's much more abstract so it only had these I rose and recession very rarely any human figures just to freedom outside Montelena oh you know the UK charts common yeah yeah and um make sure it also has something like one I showed is project set I'll show you for example this one is in Croatia and it's just on the border of the one on the left is from creation anywhere information I hope I haven't really I mean quite difficult even to find literature on Central Asian art so I'm still you know in the future maybe I'm sure it will emerge somewhere well you already mentioned that appears I mean and different regions it is related with the circle dancing which in existence children is just in other regions or gently coming from either black tea immediately reminds me of also I mean I wondering if I mean we have such creative people like me with a baby kind of how making between them or you know what sometimes you know when I hope so it seems a bit hard edge to think you know there's links between Dagestan in Bosnia but in fact when the first was settled in Bosnia the pillar of our Slovak Confederation and in modern-day dagestanis bill in how our majority so there may well have been some some actual direct historical links between those two regions so there's a lot to be history yes it's our angel for attorney general right but I'd like to personally thank and I'm actually watching is the PYD waiting for me thank you much special time I go to that is that for being with us today for giving this a very welcome press envelope you hold energy may be mysterious special thanks for eliminating up about a very curious object method that I've been personally a trying to learn so now looking backwards I tell myself that I've made a decision I'll be scheduled to attend to this tire business for but I postpone my schedule there to be with you here so there's a certain diversity if I might add just one thing about the Crete Islamic curves user has similar to stones they would call those stones bubbles here I've got I don't know whether you have that in the connection here every time you can just show the audience that what they look like but they are very curious if stones it is connected here okay so the story goes on like this and the third is that Kurtz would be a warrior and from your first living in Central Asia so those gallant terms would kill and wet they die these few stones would be directed around they add grave representing then people the Warriors that they personally killed during battle so if seven of them were surrounding the tombstone then that would mean that states they really kills those haven't like instructable warriors again and these tombstones under would have facial figures and would usually hold some cups or sometimes like people play some instruments representing that those barbells would be serving with the turqu within that be customized so the thirst even for Islam has the idea of the afterlife so that was maybe they halted historians or if the people for intro us might be a very interesting topic and you might even try to use it in your features and eloquence which are you happy Allah the word of also is found in the Philippines ethology as a monster as an undead monster eating the corpses of this risk of the disease people they

far as an email rig it's totally portable cordless you can tune in your temperature really easily and as you see it hits really smoothly and has a lotto she's about to take a hit of our grapefruit rosin which was pressed from this grapefruit flower no 100% solvent free from that flower which is grown we're up north [Music] red as soon as it turns green it's ready to go yeah definitely and you can choose like as much as as much as you want as far as like size of your of your inhale and and combine that with your temperature and really that customize [Music] and the bubbler is just killing me [Music] definitely a fan of the doctor Denver [Music] that's like you don't need the blowtorch you don't need to worry about even what your temperature is the previous method which still has some validity is the blowtorch and your temperature gun so you know exactly where you're getting your your titanium nail at this is just a standard rig that we converted and to just your traditional you know rig you know just three-stage percolator okay so I guess that concentrates market can be kind of but you know split up and obviously like dabbing but also yeah definitely what are you guys seeing in the market well a big part of what we settled on is just like our own end user experience with cut with concentrates and there is a bigger push for kind of a response to like solvents being used as a response to like Dho going with solvent free and so we you know I've been making that product for a few years now and so I was also had some insight and recognizing that you could still get a good quality product without having to did you utilize any any sort of solvents or and you're always gonna have people that are diehard BHO fans or solvent ethanol fans and that's fine because you can still make good quality product it would those with those methods ours is just really making it simple kind of going back to how it used to be just this is heat and pressure and basically hashish and in full spectrum which is another thing you see across the board with like teachers topicals pop on berkeley like you know they're big big on full spectrum for all all of the teachers and we definitely respect them as a brand they're doing the same thing that we're doing as far as using just heat and pressure to extract their hash oil and then using that homogenizing that with their custom blend of oils for their various products so then what's great about it is once you've dialed in your hash product you can find out what your cannabinoid ratios are and then just combine that with you whatever carrier oil you're working with and you can really get a consistent product that's like full-spectrum 100% quality every time talk about you know everybody thinks of DAP I mean of Rossum presses is kind of like you're doing small batch so how do you how do you paint the vision of a manufacturing facility that well really in in order to get the quality it needs to be at that scale it's it's really impossible to completely upscale on the same way that you could with with BHO or ethanol machines just because of the physics of it so what it requires is a lot of labour so this product is is born out of love like well if you're gonna be involved in making rod at Rossum you're you're gonna want to be committed to doing things and not necessarily the easy way it needs it takes a lot of fine-tuning a lot of back-and-forth each bag just by looking at each bag that we packed full of cannabis you know it each one's a little bit different a little bit thicker a little bit longer wider and it's amazing what you can pull out of it and so that affects how quickly you're gonna press down you know what pressure you're gonna start with end up with well like what did what did he [ __ ] to you about recently and what did he [ __ ] about to you recently and like I was frustrated about our excitedly well the other day he wanted a little bit lighter color out of the rosin so I had to do some experimenting you know on the temperature and also on the bag the micron size of the bag and it you know took a few hours about half the day but I gave him the results that he wanted I used a smaller micron bag and it reduces your yield but it gives you a little bit higher quality and lowered the temperature just a little bit which also can reduce the yield but it's all it's a lot of you know experimenting and each bag you know you drop down five degrees it still doesn't give you the effect you want you got a you know pack another bag and try it again so there's a lot if you really pay attention to the variables of temperature pressure and then you know micro micron size time and then bag geometry which is how big is it because there's the pressure of your machine but what's really hat what's where's the pressure at the bag and so that is directly related to your bag geometry so once you dial in one you just gotta have to keep pushing forward with you know answering some of the other variables but it's it's working as far as mass or as far as manufacturing it's it's doable and we're working off of one press and we could definitely do a lot more yeah it stands up eh oh it's like right here end of the table to about oh the surface of all the heat the actual heat plate is it's only about you know twelve inches by two and a half inches three inches and the reason why you want that is so I've worked with larger plates as well like so if you imagine a really large plate you can get a larger mass that you are you know pressing but it's not gonna press this evenly and then if you once that oil starting to be did you want it to get off those plates as quickly as possible and cooled down as quickly as possible that's exactly so exactly so narrow plate you could you get your bag packed up right to it all of that squish is gonna come out and then you can even collect it onto a cold plate if you want something that's been in the freezer exactly yeah yeah yep yep and you there are presses out there that are our square shape peer-pressured makes a great press I love their press and and I and that's what I use and the reason why I like them more than anything was their attention to their plate sizes and not and really not focusing on like more pressure means more yield because that's not necessarily true like there's a sweet spot that you need to you need to find him you can actually get great yield great and maintain quality without you know going like super excess of pressure or super excess of heat because those are the two typical ways that you typically boost up you absolutely even how fast the plate compresses so if you're with flour you want a fast compression when you're doing something like kief or bubble hash something that's a little bit more dense you want to slow down that press you could potentially make the bag explode or cause it to heat like I'm heat unevenly so it's so there's a lot of factors but but once it's what's nice about it though it's mechanical all its it's simple and calm it's not complex it's simple it's still mechanical process it's easy to control your variables your runs are fast and once you've once you've figured out for this particular strain or that or this technique he's dialed in it's just to can go I mean [Music] two to three inches so when you guys are doing this at scale like how many precedents do you have in your visit or how many of you envision having in your facility I I'd say probably like five or five to ten just really depending on Broome I mean ultimately that's what it really boils down to and just go in all day 24/7 absolutely 24/7 easy so what are like some when you guys are talking to each other like innovations you want to see something that I'd like to see is something that I like that mean I think peer pressure has got the plate size down and and the right amount of tonnage that they're using but I also appreciate a hand app and press it would be nice to see a good quality combination of the two especially when you're exactly especially when you're first learning to press there's nothing that replaces like that connection to feeling the bag and and and really understanding physically what's going on and and that actually as you get more versed in the extraction you can use that as a quick way to diagnose of you know remedy or do some troubleshooting is by just like alright what is actually going on physically at the bag that seems kind of silly but it works [Music] in like five minutes I am definitely interested in tinctures one of the things that I really appreciate about our rosin and our rosin line is speaking you can also make you know instead of having be edible or you don't really know what your dough scene is it's like having a nice one you know a milliliter dropper with it at a dose that I know where it's at and I also know that that has come from like a solvent free immunity and it's full full spectrum that and I mean those actually those are the two big things being rosin and tinctures really taking rosin oh that's really hot so live resin I mean that's basically cryogenic technique where you are making sure that the the trichomes on their plant are frozen right you know when you write at that time before just before harvest where the terpenes on the on your fresh plant are so like just Turkey it they smell so good and then you know you you you cut you dry and you cure and it doesn't quite have that same that impact and that's because though all those terpenes have volatilized so that with the the live resin processes and like fresh frozen because they're taking care taking that plant trimming it and then within hours hopefully instantaneously getting it in into a freezer that's flash frozen and then that preserves all those terpenes that's really exciting you can use that same flower to make rosin BHO any sort of x extraction and you're gonna you're gonna have a much wider terpene profile to play with and you know a different experience for the product because of that absolutely yeah they're small smaller the molecular weight it seems like everything should or is focused on kind of how do you keep as much of the yes into that plan yeah exactly right exactly what innovations are you seeing there and nothing losing none of the essence of what was in the flower today I think really fresh frozen is probably the closest thing and just doing what we're doing with with rosin is trying is trying to create a product that is as close to the flower as possible so like if you were smell you know our flower that's been pressed or the the rosin that's been pressed from the flower they have the same terpene profile the same what do you guys see like what are the first to go off the top of my head it couldn't tell you but they I could tell you they go start to come off around 170 Celsius and man it's not little blue but I kept the top of my etiquette I can't tell you but I but it's trying to do low temp presses is really what's what is gonna capture can keep all those between one 70s in South this is in Celsius or between 90 and 170 Celsius and so you're gonna actually start to get terpenes volatilizing much sooner than not at 170 Celsius but like at 70 degrees like even you have room temperature and so trying to make sure that you know you keep keep as much as you can without you know we'd still getting a product that's the balance because you still have to have yield you still have to have something you have to get something you could you could use all pressure and very very low temperature and get you know capture the most terpene profile but you're you're gonna probably get 10th to 20th of what you should if you you know kind of bump up the temperature and find that happen absolutely well exactly and you can also do mechanical separations so we've been able to do like low temp mechanical separations and get THCA that's actually something I'm really excited about and it's it's really nice to be able to get again thca without having to use solvents and it's it's a real straightforward process with with rosin you're just you're doing a mechanical separation through really fine screens multiple runs and you're collecting your turf terpenes that are pouring off and you're you so you're collecting that and your product is actually what's on the inside which would typically be your waste product you know the chip the flour chip or the keys chip that you throw away or recycle this the actual product is THC a crystal that's been the last stuff we got tested was like ninety nine six all without so all without solvents how can you tell I'm actually his apprentice he really I'm just learning the ropes but I think I'm on my way to really learning the you know the chemistry behind the planet brain hurt because it got such a workout well at first I didn't believe him that each bag would be a different and each one would take you know you have to keep your eyes on it to an extreme early and you got to know how it responds and how it likes to be treated and it really is an art rosin pressing and it's it's taken my interest

this curve being founded on the data of admissions to asylums cannot be said to be quite precise it fairly corresponds to the outbreaks of acute insanity the curve presented in chart for shows the admissions to the London County Council lunatic asylums during the years 1893 to 1897 inclusive I have arranged it in two-month periods to neutralize an important oscillations in order to show that this curve is not due to local or accidental circumstances we may turn to faults and take a special and chronic form of mental disease Gagne in his fortieth Perry presents an almost exactly similar curve of the admissions of cases of general paralysis to the infirm a special a Perry during the years 1886 to 88 chart 5 both curves alike show a major climax in spring and a minor climax in autumn

betrayed a prison de buri chapter one notwithstanding the general tendency for crime to reach its maximum in the first hot month a tendency not necessarily due to the direct influence of heat we also find when we consider the statistics of crime generally including sexual crime that there is another tendency for minor climaxes in spring and autumn thus in Italy Penta taking the statistics of nearly 4,000 crimes murder highway robbery and sexual offences found the maximum in the first summer months but there were also minor climaxes in spring and in August and September Penta revista Marcille D Sacketts RIA 1899 in nearly all Europe as shown by diagram given by Lombroso and washi that's the end of the first volume of the crime politique while the chief climaxes occur about July there is in most countries a distinct tendency to spring usually about March and autumn September November climaxes though they rarely rise as high as the jewel I climax if we consider these separate

material day psychiatry Oh 1899 Co in his crime on pay creel presents charts of the seasonal distribution of crime in Guadeloupe with relation to temperature which show that while in a mild temperature like that of France and England crime attains its maximum in the hot season it is not so in a more tropical climate in July when in Guadeloupe the heat attains its maximum degree crime of all kind false suddenly to a very low minimum even in the United States where the summer heat is often excessive it tends to produce a diminution of a crime Dexter and an elaborate study of the relationship of conduct to the weather show is that in the United States assaults present the maximum of frequency in April and October with a decrease during the summer and the winter the unusual and interesting fact demonstrated here with a certainty that cannot be doubted is he concludes that the unseasonable hot days of spring and autumn are the pugnacious ones even though the actual heat be much less than for summer we might infer from this that conditions of heat up to a certain extent are vitalizing a while at the same time irritating but above that limit heat is so d vitalizing as effects as to leave hardly energy enough to carry on a fight eg Dexter conduct and the weather 1899 page 63 at sequence it is not impossible that the phenomena of seasonal periodicity in crimes may possess a real significance in relation to sexual periodicity if as is possible the occurrence of spring and autumn climaxes of criminal activity is due last to any special exciting causes at these seasons than to the depressing influences of heat and cold in summer and winter it may appear reasonable to ask whether the spring and autumn climaxes of sexual activity or not really also largely due to a like depressed influence of extreme temperatures at the other two seasons not only is there periodicity in criminal conduct but even within the normal range of good and bad conduct seasonal periodicity may still be traced in his fiscal and industrial training of criminals HD way gives charts of the conduct of seven prisoners during several years as shown by the marks received these charts show that there is a very decided tendency to behavior during summer and winter while in spring Barbary March and April and an autumn August September October there are very market Falls to bad conduct each individual tending to adhere to a conduct curve of his own way does not himself appear to have noticed this seasonal periodicity morrow however has investigated this question in Turin on a large scale and reaches results not very dissimilar from those shown by ways figures in New York he noted the months in which over 4000 punishments were inflicted on prisoners for assaults insults threatening language etc and shows the annual curve in tavola six of his kara thierry de Delon 20 there is a market and isolated climax in May a still more sudden rise leads to the chief maximum of punishment in August and from the minimum in October there is rapid ascent during the two following months to a climax much inferior to that of May the seasonal periodicity of that conduct in prisons is of interest as showing that we cannot account for more psychic periodicity by invoking exclusively social causes this theory of psychic periodicity has been seriously put forward but has been investigated and dismissed so far as crime in Holland is concerned by jrb de Roos in the transactions of the six Congress of criminal anthropology at Turin in 1906 archive OD psychiatry ax fash 3 1906 the general statistics of suicides in content lire up show a very Euler and unbroken curve attaining a maximum in June and a minimum in December the curve rising steadily through the first six months sinking steadily through the last six months but always reaching a somewhat greater height in May than in July Marcella shows that in various European countries there is always a rise in spring and an autumn October or November more Sally attributes the spring and autumn rises to the influence of the strain of the early heat and the early cold in England also if we take a very large number of Statistics for instance the figures for London during the 20 years between 1865 and 1884 as given by algal in a paper read before the statistical society in 1886 we find that although the general curve has the same maximum and minimum points it is interrupted by a break on each side of the maximum and these two breaks occur precisely at about March and October this is shown in the curve in chart six which presents the daily average for the different months the growth of children follows an annual rhythm wall the director of an educational establishment for homeless girls in Denmark who investigated this question found that the increase of weight for all the ages investigated it was constantly about 33% greater in the summer half-year than in the winter half year it was noteworthy that even the children who had not reached school age and therefore could not be influenced by school life showed a similar those lighter difference in the same direction it is however maling Henson the director of an institution for deaf-mute in Copenhagen who has most thoroughly investigated this matter over a great many years he finds that there are three periods of growth throughout the year marked off in a fairly short manner and that during each of these periods the growth and weight and height shows constant characteristics from about the end of November up to about the end of March is a period when growth both in height and weight precedes at a medium rate reaching neither a maximum nor a minimum increase in weight is slight the increase in height although trifling preponderating after this follows a period during which the children show a marked increase in height while increase in weight is reduced to a minimum the children constantly lose in weight during this period of growth in height almost as much as they gain in the preceding period this period lasts from March and April to July and August then following the third period which continues until November and December during this period increase in height is very slight being at its early minimum increase in weight on the other hand at the beginning of the period in September and October is rapid and to the middle of December very considerable daily increase in weight being three times as great as during the winter months thus it may be said that the spring sexual climax corresponds roughly with growth in height and arrests of growth in weight while the autumn climax corresponds roughly with a period of growth in weight and arrest of growth in height maling hansen found that slight variations in the growth of the children were often dependent on changes in temperature in such a way that a rise of temperature even lasting for only a few days caused an increase of growth and a fall of temperature a decrease in growth at Hal Schmidt Menard found that nearly all growth in weight took place in the second half of the year and that the holidays made little difference in America pakkun has shown that increase of growth is chiefly from the first of May to the first of September among young girls in st. Petersburg Jenko found that increase in weight takes place in summer gopal found that increase in height takes place mostly during the first eight months of the year reaching a maximum in August declining during the autumn and winter in February being nil while in March there is sometimes loss in weight even in healthy children in the course of a study as to the consumption of bread in normal schools during each month of the year as illustrating the relationship between intellectual work and nutrition Binet presents a number of curves which bring out results to which he makes no allusion as they are outside his own investigation almost without exception these curves show that there is an increase in the consumption of bread in spring and in autumn the spring rise being in February March and April the autumn rise in October or November there are however certain fallacies in dealing with institutions like normal schools where the conditions are not perfectly regular throughout the year going to vacations etc it is therefore instructive to find that under the monotonous conditions of prison life precisely the same spring and autumn rises are found Binet takes the consumption of bread in the women's prison at Claremont where some 400 prisoners cheated between the ages of 30 and 40 are confined and he presents two curbs for the years 1895 and 1896 the curves for these two years show certain marked disagreements with each other but both unite in presenting a distinct rise in April appreciated and followed by a fall and both present a still more marked autumn rise in one case in September and November in the other case in October some years ago sir J Crichton Brown stated that a manifestation of the sexual stimulus of spring is to be found in the large number of novels read during the month of March address in psychology at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association Leeds 1889 Lancet August 14th 1889 the statement was supported by figures furnished by lending libraries and has been widely copied it would certainly be interesting if we could so simply show the connection between love and season by proving that when the birds began to sing their notes the young person's fancy Nestle turns to brood over the pictures of mating in novels I accordingly applied to mr. Kapil Shaw chief librarian of the Birmingham free libraries especially referred to by Sir J Crichton Browne who furnished me with the reports for 1896 and 1897 298 this latter report is carried on to the end of March 1898 the readers used the Birmingham free lending libraries are about 30,000 and number they consist very largely of young people between the ages of 14 and 25 somewhat less than half are women certainly we seem to have here a good field for the determination of this question the monthly figures for each of the 10 Birmingham libraries are given separately and it is clear at a glance that without exception the maximum number of readers of prose fiction at all the libraries during 1897 to 98 is found in the month of March I have chiefly taken into consideration the figures for 80 97 to 98 the figures for 1896 are somewhat abnormal and irregular probably owing to a decrease in readers attributed to increased activity and trade and partly to a disturbing influence caused by the opening of a large new library in the course of the year certainly increasing the number of readers and drafting off borrowers from some kind of other libraries not only so but there is a second or autumnal climax almost equalling the spring climax and occurring with equal certainty appearing during 1897 298 either in October or November and during 1896 constantly in October thus the periodicity of the rate of consumption of prose fiction corresponds with the periodicity which is found to occur in the conception rate and in sexual a Polock manifestation it is necessary however to examine somewhat more closely the tables presented in these reports and to compare the rate of the consumption of novels with that of the other class of literature in the first place if instead of merely considering the consumption of novels per month we make allowance for the varying length of the months and considered the average daily consumption per month the supremacy of Marsh at once vanishes February is really the month during which most novels are read during the first quarter of a Sunday except at two libraries where February and March are equal the result is similar if we ascertain the daily averages for the first quarter in 87 while in 1896 which however as I have already remarked is a rather abnormal year the daily average for March in many of the libraries falls below that for January as well as for February again when we turn to the other classes of books we find that this predominance which February possesses and to some extent shares with March and January by no means exclusively applies to novels it is not only shared by both music and poetry which would fit in well with the assumption of a sexual nicest but the Department of history biography voyages and travels shares it also with considerable regularity so also does that of Arts sciences and Natural History and it is quite well marked in theology moral philosophy etc and in juvenile literature we even have to admit that the promptings of the sexual instinct bring an increased body of visitors to the reference library where there are no novels for here also both the spring and autumnal climaxes are quite distinct certainly this theory carries us a little too far the main factor in producing this very marked annual periodicity seems to me to be wholly unconnected with the sexual impulse the winter half of the year from the beginning of October to the end of March when outdoor life has lost its that tractions and much time must be spent in the house is naturally the season for reading but during the two central months of winter December and January the attraction of reading meets with a powerful counter attraction in the excitement produced by the approach of Christmas and the increased activity of social life which accompanies and for several weeks follows Christmas in this way the other four winter months October November at the autumnal end and February in March at the spring end must inevitably present the two chief reading climaxes of the year and so reports of lending libraries present us with figures which show a striking but fallacious resemblance to curves which are probably produced by more organic causes I am far from wishing to deny that the impulse which draws young men and women to imaginative literature is unconnected with the obscure promptings of the sexual instinct but until the disturbing influence I have just pointed out is eliminated I see no evidence here for any true seasonal periodicity possibly imprisons the value of which has laboratories of experimental psychology we have scarcely yet begun to realize more reliable evidence might be obtained and those French and other prisons where novels are freely allowed to the prisoners might yield evidence as regards the consumption of fiction as instructive as that yielded at Claremont concerning the consumption of bread certain diseases showing very regular annual curve there is notably the case with scarlet fever taker found in a London fever hospital a marked seasonal prevalence there was a minor climax in May repeated in July and a great autumnal climax in October falling to a minimum in December and January this curve correspond to that usually observed in London it is not peculiar to London or to urban districts for in rural districts we find nearly the same spring minor maximum and major upon local maximum in Russia it is precisely the same many other epidemic diseases show very similar curves an annual curve may be found in the explosive force of the blotter as measured by the distance to which the urinary dream can be protected this curve as ascertained for one case is interesting an account of the close relationship between sexual and vesicle activity after a minimum point in autumn there is a rise through the early part of the year to a height maintained through spring and summer and reaching its maximum in August this may be said to correspond with the general tendency found in some cases of nocturnal seminal emissions from a winter minimum to an autumn maximum there is an annual curve in voluntary muscle strength thus in Antwerp where the scientific study of children is systematically carried out by a pathological Bureau shaitaan' found that measured by the dynamometer both at the ages of 8 & 9 both boys and girls showed a gradual increase of strength from October to January a fall from January to March and arise to June or July March was the weakest month June and July the strongest shorten also found an annual curve for mental ability as tested by power of attention which for much of the year corresponding to the curve of muscular strength being high during the cold winter months LOB's ian at kill seeking to test satan's results and adopting a different method so as to gauge memory as well as attention came to conclusions which confirmed those of shaitaan' they found a very marked increase of ability in December and January where they fall in April April and May were the minimum months while July in October also stood low the enquiries of Triton an option thus seemed to indicate that the voluntary aptitudes of muscular and mental force in children reached their maximum at a time of year when most of the more or less in volunteer activities we have been considering show a minimum of energy if this conclusion should be confirmed by more extended investigations it would scarcely be matter for surprise and would involve no true contradiction it would indeed be natural to suppose that the voluntary and regulated activities of the nervous system should work most efficiently at those periods when they are least exposed to organic and emotional disturbance so persistent a disturbing element in spring and autumn suggests that some physiological conditions underlie it and that there is a real metabolic disturbance as these times of the year so few continuous observations have yet been made on the metabolic processes of the body that it is not easy to verify such a surmise with absolute precision Edward Smith's investigations so far as they go support it Perry costs long continued observations of pulse frequency seem to show with fair regularity a maximum in early spring and another maximum in late autumn I may also note that Haig who has devoted many years of observations to the phenomena of uric acid excretion finds that uric acid tends to be highest in the spring months March April May and lowest at the first onset of cold in October thus while the sexual climaxes of spring and autumn are rooted in animal procreative cycles which in man have found expression in primitive festivals these again perhaps strengthening and developing the sexual rhythm they yet have a wider significance they constitute one among many manifestations of spring and autumn physiological disturbance corresponding with fair precision to the vernal and autumnal equinox 'as they resemble those periods of atmospheric tension of storm and wind which accompany the spring and autumn phases in the Earth's rhythm and they may fairly be regarded as ultimately a

spontaneous sexual emotion generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding directly or indirectly from another person in a wide sense which cannot be wholly ignored here autoeroticism may be said to include those transformations of repressed sexual activity which are a factor of some morbid conditions as well as of the normal manifestation of art and poetry and indeed more or less color the whole life such a definition excludes the normal sexual excitement aroused by the presence of a beloved person of the opposite sex it also excludes the perverted sexuality associated with an attraction to the person of the same sex it further excludes the manifold forms of erotic fetishism in which the normal focus of sexual attraction is displaced and voluptuous emotions are aroused only by some object hair shoes garments etc which to the ordinary lover are of subordinate though still indeed considerable importance the autoerotic field remains extensive it ranges from occasional voluptuous daydreams in which the subject is entirely passive to the perpetual unashamed efforts at sexual stealth manipulation witnessed among the insane it also includes though chiefly as curiosities those cases in which individuals fall in love with themselves among auto-erotic phenomenon or on the borderland we must further include those religious sexual manifestations for an ideal object of which we may find evidence in the lives of saints and ecstatics the typical form of autoeroticism is the occurrence of the sexual orgasm during sleep I do not know that any apology is needful for the invention of the term Auto or autism there is no existing word and current use to indicate the whole range of phenomena I am here concerned with we are familiar with masturbation but that strictly speaking only covers a special and arbitrary subdivision of the field although it is true the subdivision with which physicians and alienists have chiefly occupied themselves self-abuse is somewhat wider but by no means covers the whole ground while for various reasons it is an unsatisfactory term onanism is largely used especially in France and some writers even include all forms of homosexual connection under this name it may be convenient to do so from a physiological point of view but it is confusing and antiquated mode procedure and from the psychological standpoint altogether illegitimate onanism ought never to be used in this connection if only on the ground that own ins device was not auto-erotic but an early example of withdrawal before emission or coitus interruptus while the name that I have chosen may possibly not be the best there should be no question as to the importance of grouping all these phenomenon together it seems to me that this field has rarely been viewed in a scientifically sound and morally sane light simply because it has not been viewed as a whole we have made it difficult so to view it by directing our attention on special group of auto-erotic facts that group included under masturbation which was most easy to observe and which in an extreme form came plainly under medical observation in insanity and allied conditions and we have willfully torn this group of facts away from the larger group to which it naturally belongs the questions which have been so widely so diversely and it must unfortunately be added often so mischievous Li discussed considering the nature and evils of masturbation are not seen in their true light and proportions until we realized that masturbation is but a specialized form of a tendency which in some form or in some degree normally affects not only man but all higher animals from a medical point of view it is often convenient to regard masturbation as an isolated fact but in order to understand it we must bear in mind its relationships in this study of autoeroticism I shall frequently have occasion to refer to the old entity of masturbation because it has been more carefully studied than any other part of the autoerotic field but I hope it will always be borne in mind that the psychological significance and even the medical diagnostic value of masturbation cannot be appreciated unless we realize that it is an artificial subdivision from a great group of natural facts the study of Ottowa autism is far from being an unimportant or merely curious study yet psychologists medical and non-medical almost without exception treat its manifestations when they refer to them at all in a dogmatic and offhand manner which is far from scientific it is not surprising therefore that the most widely divergent opinions are expressed nor is it surprising that ignorant and chaotic notions among the general population should lead to results that would be ludicrous if they were not pathetic to mention one instance known to me a married lady who is a leader in social purity movements and an enthusiast for sexual chastity discovered through reading some pamphlet against CELTA her advice that she herself had been practicing masturbation for years without knowing it the profound anguish and hopeless despair of this woman in face of what she believed to be the moral ruin of her whole life cannot be well described it would be easy to give further examples though a scarcely more striking one to show other confusion into which we are thrown by leaving this matter in the hands of the blind leaders of the blind moreover the conditions of modern civilization render autoeroticism a matter of increasing social significance as our marriage rate declines and as illicit sexual relationship continued to be openly discouraged it is absolutely inevitable that auto-erotic phenomena of one kind or another not only among women but among men should increase among us both an amount and intensity it becomes therefore a matter of some importance both to the moralist and the physician to investigate the psychological nature of these phenomena and to decide precisely what their attitude should be toward them I do not purpose to enter into a thorough discussion of all the aspects of Ottowa autism that would involve a very extensive study indeed I wish to consider briefly certain salient points concerning autoerotic phenomenon especially the prevalence the nature and their moral physical and other effects I base my study partly on the facts and opinions which during the last thirty years have been scattered through the periodical and other medical literature of Europe and America and partly on the experience of individuals especially of fairly normally individuals among animals in isolation and sometimes in freedom though this can less often be observed it is well known that various forms of spontaneous solitary sexual excitement occur horses when leading a lazy life may be observed flapping the penis until some degree of emission takes place Welsh ponies I learned from a man who has had much experience with these animals habitually produce erections and emissions in their stalls they do not bring their hind quarters up during this process and they close their eyes which does not take place when they have Congress with mares the same informant observed that bulls and goats produce emissions by using their forelegs as a stimulus bringing up their hindquarters Mayers rub themselves against objects I'm informed by a gentleman who is a recognized authority on goats that they sometimes take the penis into the mouth and produce actual orgasm thus practicing autofellatio as regards ferrets the Reverend H Norcutt States I'm informed by a gentleman who has had considerable experience of ferrets that if the [ __ ] when in heat cannot obtain a dog she pines and becomes ill if the smooth pebble is introduced into the hutch she will masturbate upon it thus preserving her normal health for one season but if this artificial substitute is given to her a second season she will not as formerly be content with it stags in the rutting season when they have no partners rub themselves against trees to produce ejaculation sheep masturbate has also do camels pressing themselves down against convenient objects and elephants compressed the penis between the hind legs to obtain emissions blumenbach observed a bear act somewhat similarly upon seeing other bears coupling and hyenas according to plan bottles have been seen practicing mutual masturbation by licking each other's genitals mammary masturbation remarks Ferrer is found in certain female and even male animals like the dog and cat apes are much given a masturbation even in freedom according to the evidence of good observers for while no female Apes of celibates many of the males are obliged to lead a life of celibacy male monkeys use the hand in masturbation to rub and shake the penis in the human species these phenomena are by no means found in civilization alone to whatever extent masturbation may have been developed by the conditions of European life which carry to the utmost extreme that concomitant stimulation and repression of sexual emotions it is far from being as men to Gaza has declared it to be one of the moral characteristics of Europeans it is found among the people of nearly every race in which we have any intimate knowledge however natural the conditions under which men and women may live thus among the Nama hottentots among the young women at all events Gustov Frisch found that masturbation is so common that it is to be regarded the custom of the country no secret is made of it and in the stories and legends of the race it is treated as one of the most ordinary facts of life it is so also among the basu toes and the calf ears are addicted to the same habit the fugiens have a word for masturbation and a special word for masturbation by women when the Spaniards first arrived at Vizcaya in the Philippines they found that masturbation was universal and that it was customary for the women to use an artificial penis and abnormal methods of sexual gratification among the Balinese according to Jacobs as quoted by PLAs and bottles masturbation is general in the boudoir of many a Bali beauty he adds and in every harem may be found a wax penis to which many hours of Solitude are devoted throughout the east as Arum speaking from a long medical experience has declared masturbation is very prevalent especially among young girls in Egypt according to Cellini it is prevalent in harems in India a medical correspondent tells me he once treated the widow of a wealthy mohammad e'en who informed him that she began masturbation at an early age just like all other women the same informant tells me that on the facade of a large temple in Orissa are bas reliefs representing both men and women alone masturbating and also women masturbating men among the Tamils of Ceylon masturbation is said to be common in Cochin China Lorien remarks it is practiced by both sexes but especially by the married women Japanese women have probably carried the mechanical arts of autoeroticism to the highest degree of perfection they used to hollow balls about the size of the pigeons egg sometimes one alone is used which as described by Jost Christian and others are made of very thin leaves of brass one is empty the other called the little man contains a small heavy metal ball or elf some Quicksilver and sometimes metal tongues which vibrate when sent in movement so that if the balls are held in the hand side by side there's continuous movement the empty one is first introduced into the vagina in contact with the uterus than the other the slightest movement of the pelvis off eyes or even spontaneous movement of the organs causes the metal ball or Quicksilver to roll and the resulting vibration produces a prolonged voluptuous titillation a gentle shock as from a weak electric inductive apparatus the balls are called Rin no tama and are held in the vagina by a proper tampon the women who use these balls delight to swing themselves in a hammock a rocking chair the delicate vibration of the ball slowly producing the highest degree of sexual excitement jost mentions that this apparatus though well known by name to ordinary girls is chiefly used by the more fashionable geishas as well as by prostitutes its use has now spread to China anam and India Japanese women also it is said frequently used an artificial penis of paper and clay called ng among the Archaea again according to Jacobs as quoted by plus the young of both sexes masturbate in the elder girls use an artificial penis of wax in China also the artificial penis made of rosin supple and like the classical instrument described by Honda's rose-colored is publicly sold and widely used by women it may be noticed that among non-european races it is among women and especially among those who are subjected to the excitement of a life professionally devoted to some form of pleasure that the use of the artificial instruments of Ottawa autism is chiefly practiced the same is markedly true in Europe the use of an artificial penis in solitaire sexual gratification may be traced down from classic times and doubtless prevailed in the very earliest human civilization for such an instrument is said to be represented in old Babylonian sculptures and it is referred to by his zekiel chapter 16 verse 17 the lesbian women are said to have used such instruments made of ivory or gold with silken stuffs in linen Arista feigns in legislative verse 109 speaks of a manufacture by Malaysian women of leather artificial penis or lesbos in the British Museum is a vase representing the hot IRA holding such instruments when as found at Pompeii may be seen in the Museum at Naples one of the best of her and is's mimes the private conversation presents a dialogue between two ladies consenting a certain or lesbos which one of them wants as the dream of delight through the Middle Ages when from time to time the clergy reprobated the use of such instruments that continued to be known and after the 15th century the references to them became more precise thus 14e the Sienese novelist of the 16th century refers in his novel Bell no VC seventh-day novella 34 to the glass object filled with warm water which nuns used to calm the sting of the flesh and to satisfy themselves as well as they can he adds that widows and other women anxious to avoid pregnancy availed themselves of it in Elizabethan England at the same time it appears to have been of a similar character and Mostyn in his satires tells how Lucia prefers a glassy instrument to her husband's lukewarm bed in 16th century France also such instruments were sometimes made of glass and brento may refers to the god mesh in 18th century Germany they were called Sam Danza and their use according to Heinz as quoted by durin was common among aristocratic women in England by that time the dildo appears to have become common Archambault states that while in Paris they are sold secretly in London a certain mrs. Philips sold them openly on a large scale in her shop and light Chester Square John be in 1835 stating that the name was originally dildol remarks that their use was formally commoner than was in his day in France madame Gordon the most notorious brothel keeper of the 18th century carried on a wholesale trade in consulate tours as they were called and at her death numbers letters from Abbas's and simple nuns were found among her papers asking for a consulate tour to be sent the modern French instrument is described by gamma air as of hardened red rubber exactly imitating the penis and capable of holding warm milk or other fluid for injection at the moment of orgasm the compressible scrotum is said to have been first added in the 18th century in Islam the artificial penis has reached nearly as high development as in Christendom Turkish women used it and it is said to be openly sold in Smyrna in the harems of Zanzibar according to Baumann it is of considerable size carved out of ebony or ivory and commonly board so that warm water may be injected it is here regarded as an Arab invention somewhat similar appliances may be traced in all centers of civilization but throughout they appear to be frequently confined to the world of prostitutes and to those women who live on fashionable or semi artistic verge of that world ignorance and delicacy combined with a less versatile and perverted concentration on the sexual impulse to prevent any general recourse to such highly specialized methods of solitary gratification on the other hand the use or rather abuse of the ordinary objects and implements of daily life in obtaining auto-erotic gratification among the ordinary population in civilized modern lands has reached an extraordinary degree of extent and variety we can only feebly estimate by the occasional resulting mischances which come under the surgeon's hands because only a certain proportion of such instruments are dangerous thus the banana seems to be widely used for masturbation by women and appears to be marked out for the purpose by its size and shape it is however innocuous and never comes under the surgeon's notice the same may probably be said of the cucumbers and other vegetables more especially used by country and factory girls and masturbation a lady living near vici told poly aid that she had often heard and had herself been able to verify the fact that the young peasant women commonly used turnips carrots and beet roots in the 18th century Mirabeau in his erotica bibley on gave a list of the various objects used in convents which he describes as vast theaters of such practices to obtain solitary sexual excitement in more recent years the following are a few of the objects found in the vagina or bladder whence they could only be removed by surgical interference pencils sticks of sealing wax cotton reels hair pins and in Italy very commonly the bone pins used in the hair Bodkins knitting needles crochet needles needle cases compasses glass Stoppers candles corks tumblers Forks to fix toothbrushes homemade pots in the case recorded by shorter with a cockchafer inside a makeshift substitute for Japanese or in no tama well in one recent english case a full-sized hen's egg was removed from the vagina of a middle-aged married woman more than nine-tenths of the foreign bodies found in the female bladder or urethra are due to masturbation the age of the individuals in whom such objects it has been found is usually from 17 to 30 but in a few cases they've been found in girls below 14 infrequently in women between 40 and 50 the large objects naturally are found chiefly in the vagina and unmarried women hairpins have above all been found in the female bladder with special frequency this point is worth some consideration as the illustration of the enormous frequency of this form of ottawa autism the female urethra is undoubtedly a normal center of sexual feeling as Polly a pointed out many years ago a woman medical correspondent also writes that in some women the maximum of voluptuous sensation is at the vesicle sphincter or orifice though not always so limited eh Smith indeed considers that the urethra is the part in which the orgasm occurs and remarks that in sexual excitement mucus always flows largely from the urethra it should be added that when once introduced the physiological mechanism of the bladder apparently causes the organ to tend to swallow the foreign object yet for every case in which the hairpin disappears and is lost in the bladder from carelessness or the oblivion of the sexual spasm there must be a vast number of cases in which the instrument is used without any such an unfortunate result there is thus great significance in the frequency with which cases of hairpin in the bladder are strewn through medical literature of all countries in 1862 a German surgeon found the accident so common that he invented a special instrument for extracting the hairpins from the female bladder as indeed Italian and French surgeons also have done in France say of Bordeaux came to the conclusion that happen in the bladder is the commonest result of masturbation has known to the surgeon in England cases are constantly being recorded loccent eight stating that most cases of stone in the bladder in women are due to the introduction of a foreign body very often a hairpin adds I have removed hairpins encrusted with phosphates from ten different female bladders and that one of the owners of these bladders would give any account of the incident Stokes again records that during four years he had four cases of hairpin in the female urethra in New York one physician meant with four cases in a short experience in Switzerland professor revered in had a precisely similar experience there is however another class of material objects widely employed for producing physical auto or autism which in the nature of things never reaches the surgeon I refer to the effects that naturally or unnaturally may be produced by many of the objects and implements of daily life that do not normally come in direct contact with the sexual organs children sometimes even when scarcely more than infants produce sexual excitement by friction against the corner of a chair or other piece of furniture and women sometimes do the same good seat in Russia new women who made a large knot in their camisas to rub against and mentions a woman who would sit on a naked heel and rub it against her girls in France I'm informed are fond of riding on the Shahadah boy or hobby horses because of the sexual excitement thus aroused and that the sexual emotions play a part in the fascination exerted by this form of amusement everywhere is indicated by the ecstatic phases of its devotees at the temples in some parts of Central India I am told swings are hung up in pairs men and women swinging in these until sexually excited during the months when the men in these districts have to be away from home the girls put up swings to console themselves for the loss of their husbands it is interesting to observe that the very wide prevalence of a swinging often of a religious or Magic character and the evident sexual significance underlying it although this is not always clearly brought out grooves discussing a frequency of swinging refers for instance to the customer of the gilbert islanders for a young man to swing a girl from a cocoa palm and then to cling on and swing with her in ancient greece women and grown-up girls were fond of seesaws and swings the athenians had indeed a swinging festival songs of a voluptuous character we gather from the athenians were sung by the women at this festival jg frazier discusses the question and brings instances in which men or especially women swing the notion seems to be he states that the ceremony promotes fertility whether in the vegetable or in the animal kingdom though white should be supposed to do so I confess myself unable to explain the explanation seems however not far to seek in view of the facts quoted above and Frazier himself refers to the voluptuous character of the song sometimes sung even apart from actual swinging of the whole body a swinging movement may suffice to arouse sexual excitement and may at all events in women constitute an essential part of methods of attaining solitary sexual gratification Kiernan thus describes the habitual auto-erotic procedure of a young American woman the patient knelt before a chair let her elbows drop on its seat grasping the arms with a firm grip then commenced the swinging writhing motion seeming to fix her pelvis and moving her trunk and limbs the muscles were rigid the face took on a passionate expression the features were contorted the eyes rolled the teeth were set and the lips compressed while the cheeks remained purple the condition of bor\u00e5s striking resemblance to the passional stage of grant hysteria the reveling took only a moment to commence but lasted a long time swaying induced a pleasurable sensation accompanied with a feeling of section upon the clitoris almost immediately after a sensation of bursting caused by discharge from the Volvo vaginal glands occurs followed by a rapture prolonged for an indefinite time the accompanying sexual imagery is so vivid as to become also hallucinatory JG Kirin sex transformation and psychic impotence American Journal of Dermatology vol 9 number 2 somewhat similarly sensations of a sexual character are sometimes experienced by boys climbing up the pole it is not even necessary that there should be direct external contact with the sexual organs and how states that gymnastic swinging poles around which boys swing while supporting the whole weight on the hands may suffice to produce sexual excitement several writers have pointed out that the writing especially in women may produce sexual excitement and orgasm it is well known also both in men and women the vibratory motion of a railway train frequently produces a certain degree of sexual excitement especially when sitting forward such excitement may remain latent and not become specifically sexual I am not aware that this quality of railway traveling has ever been fostered as a sexual perversion but the sewing machine has attracted considerable attention on account of its influence in exciting autoerotic manifestations the early type of sewing machine especially was of a very heavy character and involved much up-and-down movement of the legs Langton down pointed out many years ago this frequently produced some great sexual Aerith ISM which has led to masturbation according to one French Authority it is a well recognized fact that to work a sewing machine with the body in certain positions produces sexual excitement leading to orgasm the occurrence of the orgasm is indicated to the observer by the machine being worked for a few seconds with uncontrollable rapidity this sound is said to be frequently heard in large French work rooms and it is a part of the duty of the superintendent's to make the girls sit properly during a visit which I once paid to a manufactory of military clothing poly-a rights I witnessed the following scene in the midst of the uniform sound produced by some 30 sewing machines I suddenly heard one of the machines working with much more velocity than the others I looked at the person who was working it a brunette of 18 or 20 while she was automatically occupied with the trousers she was making on the machine her face became animated her mouth opened slightly her nostrils dilated her feet moved the pedals with constantly increasing rapidity soon I saw a convulsive look in her eyes her eyelids were lowered her face turned pale and was thrown backward hands and legs stopped and became extended a suffocated cry followed by a long sigh I was lost in the noise of the workroom the girl remained motionless for a few seconds drew out her handkerchief to wipe away the pearls of sweat from her forehead and after casting a timid and ashamed glance at her companions resumed her work the four woman who acted as my guide having observed the direction of my gaze took me up to the girl who blushed lowered her face and murmured some incoherent words before the forewoman had opened her mouth to advise her to sit fully on the chair and not sit on its edge as I was leaving I heard another machine of another part of the room and accelerated movement the four woman smiled at me and remarked that it was so frequent that it attracted no notice it was specially observed she told me in the case of young work girls apprentices and those who sat on the edge of their seats thus much facilitating friction of the labia in cases where the sewing machine does not lead to direct self excitement it has been held as by Fothergill to predispose to frequency of involuntary sexual orgasm during sleep from the irritation set up by the movement of a feet in sitting posture during the day the essential movement in working the sewing machine is the flexion and extension of the ankle but the muscles of the thighs are used to maintain the feet firmly on the treadle the thighs are held together and there is a considerable degree of flexion or extension of the thighs the trunk by a special adjustment of the body and sometimes perhaps merely in the presence of sexual hyperesthesia it is thus possible to act upon the sexual organs but this is by no means that necessary result of using the sewing machine and inquiry of various women with well-developed sexual feelings who are accustomed to work the treadle has not shown the presence of any tendency in this direction sexual irritation may also be produced by the bicycle and women the smaller remarks that he knows many married women and some unmarried who experience sexual excitement when cycling in several cases he has ascertained that the excitement has carried as far as complete orgasm this result cannot however easily happen unless the seat is too high the peak in contact with the organs and a rolling movement is adopted in the absence of marked hyperesthesia these results are only affected by a bad seat or an improper attitude the body during cycling resting under proper conditions on the buttocks and the work being mainly done by the muscles of the thighs and legs which control the ankles flexions of the thigh and the pelvis being very small most medical authorities on cycling are of opinion that when cycling leads to sexual excitement the fault lies more with the woman than with the Machine the conclusion does not appear to me to be absolutely correct I find on inquiry that with the old fashioned saddle with an elevated peak rising towards the pubes a certain degree of sexual excitement not usually producing the orgasm but as one lady expressed it making one feel quite ready for it is fairly common among women lights tan finds that irritation of the genital organs may unquestionably be produced in both males and females bicycling the aggravation of hemorrhoids sometimes produced by cycling indicates also the tendency to local congestion with improved flat saddles however constructed with more definite - adjustment to the anatomical formation of the parts this general tendency is reduced to a negligible minimum the reference may be made for this point to the influence of tight lacing this has been recognized by gynecologists as a factor of sexual excitement and a method of masturbation women who have never worn corsets sometimes find that on first putting them on sexual feeling is so intensified that it is necessary to abandon their use the reason of this as Seibert points out in his book 4 L turn seems to be that the course of both favors pelvic congestion and at the same time exerts a pressure on the abdominal muscles which brings them into the stage produced during coitus it is doubtless for the same reason as some women have found that more distension of the bladder is possible without corsets than with end of autoeroticism part 1 section 1 rhotacism a study of the spontaneous manifestations of the sexual impulse

please visit librivox.org autoeroticism a study of the spontaneous manifestations of the sexual impulse part 1 section 2 in a further class of cases no external object whatever is used to procure the sexual orgasm but the more or less voluntary pressure of the thighs alone is brought to bear upon the sexual regions it is done either when sitting or standing the thighs being placed together and firmly crossed and the pelvis rocked so that the sexual organs are pressed against the inner and posterior parts of the thighs this is sometimes done by men and is fairly common among women especially according to March now among those who sit much such as dressmakers and milliner's those who use the sewing machine and those who ride very low remarks that in an experience in Scandinavia thigh friction is a communist form of masturbation in women the practice is widespread and a medical correspondent in India turned me off a brahmin widow who confessed of this form of masturbation I am told that in London both schools at the present time fire rubbing is not infrequent among the girls colours the proportion mentioned in one school was about 10% of the girls over 11 the thigh rubbing is done more or less openly and is interpreted for the uninitiated as do merely to a desire to relieve the bladder it is found in female entrance that's Townsend records the case of an infant 8 month old who would cross her right thigh over the left closed her eyes and clenched her fists after a minute there would be complete relaxation with sweating and redness of face this would occur about once a week or oftener the child was quite healthy with no abnormal condition of the genital organs the frequency of thigh friction among women as a form of masturbation is due to the fact that it is usually acquired innocently and it involves no indecorum their suits or reports the case of a girl of 12 oh it's cold when having to wait her turn at the water closet for fear of wetting herself would put her clothes between her legs and we're surprised together moving them backwards and forwards in the efforts to control her bladder she discovered that a pleasurable sensation who was thus produced and acquired the habit of practicing the maneuver for its own sake at the age of 17 she began to vary it in different ways thus she would hang from a tree with her legs swinging and her shimmy is pressed between her thighs which she would rub together by friction in some of its forms is so comparatively decorous a form of masturbation that it may even be performed in public places thus a few years ago while waiting for a train at a station on the outskirts of a provincial town I became aware of the presence of a young woman sitting alone on a seat at a little distance whom I could observe unnoticed she was leaning back with legs crossed swinging the crossed foot vigorously and continuously this continued without interruption for 10 minutes after I first observed her then the swinging movement reached a climax she leaned still further back thus bringing the sexual region still more closely in contact with the edge of the bench and straightened and stiffened her body and legs in what appeared to be a momentary spasm there could be little doubt as to what had taken place a few moments later she slowly walked from her solitary seat into the waiting room and sat down among the other waiting passengers quite still now and with uncross legs apparel quiet young woman possibly a farmer's daughter serenely unconscious that her maneuver had been detected and very possibly herself ignorant of its true nature there are many other forms in which the impulse of autoeroticism presents itself dancing is often a powerful method of sexual excitement not only among civilized but among savage peoples and Zack describes the erotic dances of Swahili women as having a masturbatory object stimulation of the needs is a potent adjuvant to the production of self excitement and self-flagellation with rods etc is practiced by some individuals especially young women altercation is another form of this stimulation Levithan knew a young woman who obtained sexual gratification by flogging herself with chestnut burns and it is stated that in some parts of France it is not uncommon for young girls to masturbate by rubbing the leaves of the linaria symbol area here are called Pinton or timber onto the sexual parts thus producing a burning sensation stimulation of the mama normally in our genus Center in women may occasionally serve as a method for obtaining auto-erotic satisfaction including the orgasm in both sexes I have been told of a case in a man and a medical correspondent in India informs me that he knows a Eurasian woman addicted to masturbation who can only obtain the orgasm by rubbing the genitals with one hand while with the other she rubs and finally squeezes her breath the tactile stimulation even of regions of the body which are not normally erogenous zones in either sex may sometimes lead on to sexual excitement her CH crew as well as Freud believes that this is often the case as regards finger sucking until shocking in infancy even stroking the chin remarks de brain may produce a pollution Taylor refers to the case of a young woman of 22 who was liable to attacks of Couric moons of the hands which were terminate and alternately pressing the middle finger on the tip of the nose and the triggers of the ear when a far-away pleased expression would appear on her face she best produced sexual excitement and satisfaction she had no idea of wrongdoing and was surprised and ashamed when she realized the nature of her act most of the foregoing examples of autoeroticism are commonly included by no means correctly under the heading of masturbation there are however a vast number of people possessing strong sexual emotions and living a solitary life who experience symptoms by instinct and sometimes on moral grounds a strong repugnance for these manifestations of autoeroticism as one highly intelligent lady writes I have sometimes wondered whether I could produce it that is complete sexual excitement mechanically but I have a curious unreasonable repugnance to trying the experiment it would materialize it too much the same repugnance may be traced in the tendency to avoid so far as possible the use of hands it is quite common to find this instinctive unreasoning repugnance among women a healthy repugnance not founded on any moral ground in men the same repugnance exists more often combined with or replaced by a very strong moral and aesthetic objection to such practices but the presence of such a repugnance however invincible is very far from carrying us outside the autoerotic field the production of the sexual orgasm is not necessarily dependent on any external contact or voluntary mechanical cause as an example though not of specifically auto-erotic manifestations I mean mentioned in the case of a man of 57 a somewhat eccentric creature etc who writes my whole nature goes out so to some persons and they thrill and stir me so that I had an omission while sitting by them with no thought of sex only the gladness of soul found its way out thus and a glow of health so fused the whole body there was no spasmodic conclusion but a pleasing gentle sensation as a few drops of semen passed in reality no doubt not semen but urethra fluid this man's condition may certainly be considered somewhat morbid he is attracted to both men and women and the sexual impulse seems to be irritable and weak very similar stage of things exist so often in women no doubt due to sexual repression and in individuals who are in a general state of normal and good health that in these it can scarcely be called morbid brooding on sexual images which the theologian stoned elect RT Omarosa Malita spontaneous orgasm in either sex even in perfectly normal persons Hammond described as a not uncommon form of psychic coitus a condition in which the simple act of imagination alone in the presence of the desired object suffices to produce orgasm in some public conveyance theater or elsewhere the man sees a desirable woman and by concentrating his attention on her person and imagining all the states of intimacy he quickly succeeds in producing orgasm nice fellow refers to an Italian work girl of 14 who could obtain ejaculation of mucus four times a day in the workroom in the presence of the other girls without touching herself or moving her body by simply thinking of sexual things if the orgasm occurs spontaneously without the aid of mental impressions or any manipulations ad hoc though under such conditions it ceases to be sinful from the theological standpoint it certainly sees is also to be normal Sara records the case of a somewhat neurotic woman of 50 who had been separated from her husband for ten years since lived a chaste life at this age however she became subject to violent crises of sexual orgasm which would come on without any accompaniment of voluptuous thoughts McGillicutty records three cases of spontaneous orgasms and women coming under his notice such crises are frequently found in both men and women who from moral reasons ignorance or on other grounds are restrained from attaining the complete sexual orgasm but whose sexual emotions are literally continually dribbling from them shrink Nexus knows a lady who is spontaneously sexually excited on hearing music are seeing pictures without anything lascivious in them she knows nothing of sexual relationships another lady is sexually excited on seeing beautiful and natural team like the see sexual ideas are mixed up in her mind with these things and the contemplation of especially strong and sympathetic man brings the orgasm on in about a minute both these ladies masturbate in the streets restaurants railways theatres without anyone perceiving it a Brahmin woman informed the medical correspondent in India that she had distinct the freewill orgasm with copious outflow of mucus if she stayed long near a man whose face she liked and this is not uncommon among European women evidently under such conditions there is a state of hyper aesthetic weakness here however we are passing the frontiers of strictly auto-erotic phenomena delecti of morosa as understood by the theologians is distinct from desire and also distinct from the definite intention of affecting the sexual act although it may lead to those things it is a voluntary and complacent dallying in imagination with voluptuous thoughts when no effort has made to repel them it is as Aquinas and others point out constitute by this act of complacent dallying and has no reference to the duration of the imaginative process debris in his monkey ology deals fully with this question and coats the opinions of theologians I may add that in the early penitential before the elaboration of catholic theology the voluntary emission of semen through the influence of evil talks was recognized as a sin though usually only if it occurred in church in Egberts penitential of the eighth or ninth century the penance assigned for this offense in the case of a deacon is 25 days in the case of a monk 30 days a priest forty days a bishop 15 the frequency of spontaneous orgasm in women seems to have been recognized in the 17th century thus shirin apparently quoting rollin states with some women are so wanton the sight of a handsome man or of a lover or speech with such a one will cause them to ejaculate their semen there is however a closely allied and indeed overlapping form of autoeroticism which may be considered here i mean that associated with reverie or daydreaming although this is a very common and important form of autoeroticism besides being in a large proportion of cases the early stage of masturbation it appears to have attracted little attention the daydream has indeed been studied in its chief form in the continued story by Mabel Leo roid of Wesley College the continued story is an emergent narrative more or less peculiar to the individual by whom it is cherished with fondness and regarded as an especially sacred mental possession to be shared only if at all with very sympathizing friends it is commoner among girls and young women then among boys and young men among 352 percents of both sexes 47 percent among the women and only 14% among the men have any continued story the starting point is an incident from a book or more usually from actual experience which the subject develops the subject is nearly always the hero or the heroine of the story the growth of the story is favored by solitude and lying in bed before going to sleep is a time specially sacred to its cultivation no distinct reference perhaps natural ena is made bamboos Leroy to the element of sexual emotion with which these stories are often strongly tinged and which is frequently their real motive though by no means easy to detect these elaborate and more or less erotic daydreams are not uncommon in young men and especially in young women each individual has his own particular dream which is always varying or developing but except a very imaginative persons to no great extent such daydream is often founded on a base of the pleasurable personal experience and develops on that basis it may evolve an element of perversity even though that element finds no expression in real life it is of course fostered by sexual abstinence hence its frequency in young women most usually there is little attempt to realize it it does not necessarily lead to masturbation though it often causes some sexual congestion or even spontaneous sexual orgasm the daydream is a strictly private and intimate experience not only from its very nature but also because it occurs in images which the subject finds great difficulty in translating into language even when willing to do so in other cases it is elaborately dramatic or romantic in character the hero or heroine passes through many experiences before attaining the erotic climax of the story this climax tends to develop in harmony with a subject growing knowledge or experience at first Emilia kiss it may develop into any refinement of voluptuous gratification the daydream may occur either in normal or abnormal persons Rousseau in his confessions describes such dreams in his case combined with masochism and masturbation a distinguished American novelist hamlin garland has admirably described in rows of duchess Cooley the part played in the erotic daydreams of a healthy normal girl at adolescence fire circus rider seen on the first visit to a circus and becoming a majestic ideal to dominate the girls thoughts for many years rahula which describes a process by which in sexual inverts the vision of a person of the same sex perhaps seen in the streets or the theater is evoked in solitary reveries producing a kind of psychic onanism whether or not it leads to physical manifestations although daydreaming of this kind has a present been very little studied Phil that loves solitude and secrecy have never been counted of sufficient interest for scientific Inquisition it is really a process of considerable importance and occupies a large part of the autoerotic field it is frequently cultivated by refined and imaginative young men and women who lead a chaste life and would often be repelled by masturbation in such persons under such circumstances it must be considered a strictly normal the inevitable outcome of the play of the sexual impulse no doubt it may often become morbid and is never a healthy process when indulged into excess I would is liable to be by refined young people with artistic impulses to whom it is in the highest degree seductive and insidious as we have seen however daydreaming is far from always colored by sexual emotion yet it is a significant indication of its really sexual origin that as I have informed by persons of both sexes even in these apparently non-sexual cases it frequently ceases altogether on marriage even when we have eliminated all these forms of auto-erotic activity however refined in which the subject takes a voluntary part we have still left unexplored an important portion of the autoerotic field a portion which many people are alone inclined to consider normal sexual orgasm during sleep that under conditions of sexual abstinence and healthy individuals there must inevitably be some auto-erotic manifestations during waking life a careful study of the facts compels us to believe there can be no doubt also that under the same conditions the occurrence of the complete orgasm during sleep with in men seminal emissions is altogether normal even Zaius himself as parsonage has recorded was liable to such accidents a statement which at all events shows that to the Greek mind there was nothing derogatory in such an occurrence the Jews however regarded it as an impurity and the same idea was transmitted to the Christian Church and embodied in the word pollute you by which the phenomenon was designated in ecclesiastical phraseology according to bill alert and other theologians pollution in sleep is not sin unless voluntarily caused if however it begins in sleep and is completed in the half waking state for the sensation of pleasure it is a venial sin but it seems allowable to permit a nocturnal pollution to complete itself an awakening if it occurs without intention and same farmers even says see pollute eo+ hardwood natural exonerol to you well Olivia Theo pectin non creditor notwithstanding the fair and logical position of the more distinguished Latin theologians there has certainly been a widely prevalent belief in Catholic on raise that pollution during sleep is a sin in the Parsons tale Chaucer makes the parson say another sin apart in earth to luxury that cometh in sleeping and the sin cometh oft to them that be maidens and eat to them that be corrupt and their sin men treat pollution that cometh in for manners these for manners being number one languishing of body from rank and abundant humors number two informative three sir fate of meat and drink for villainous thoughts for hundred years later madam ruined in her memoirs particular presented a vivid picture of the anguish produced in an innocent girls mind by the notion of the sinfulness of erotic dreams she means to wait at first at the age of fourteen before this she writes I had sometimes been awakened from the deepest sleep in a surprising manner imagination played no part I exercised it on too many serious subjects and my timorous conscience preserved it from amusement with other subjects so that it could not represent what I would not allow it to seek to understand but an extraordinary effervescence arouses my senses in the heat of repose and by virtue of my excellent Constitution operated by itself a purification which was as strange to me as its cause the first feeling which resulted was I know not why a sort of fair I had observed in my fellow tea that we are not allowed to obtain any pleasure from our bodies except in lawful marriage what I had experienced could be called a pleasure I was then guilty and in a class of offenses which cost me the most shame and sorrow since it was that which was most displeasing to the spotless lamb there was great agitation in my poor heart prayers and multiplications how could her avoided for indeed had not foreseen it but at the instant when I experienced it I had not taken the trouble to prevented my watchfulness became extreme I scrupulously avoided positions which I found specially exposed me to the accident my restlessness became so great that at last I was able to awake before the catastrophe when I was not in time to prevent it I would jump out of bed with naked feet onto the polished floor and with crossed arms pray to the Savior to preserve me from the wiles of the devil I would then impose some penance on myself and I have carried out to the letter what the Prophet King probably only transmitted to us as a figure of Oriental speech mixing ashes with my bread and

spontaneous manifestations of the sexual impulse part 1 section 3 - the early protestant mind as illustrated by luther there was something diseased though not impure in sexual excitement during sleep thus in a stable talk Luther remarks that girls who have such dreams should be married at once taking the medicine which God has given it is only of comparatively recent years that medical science has obtained currency for the belief that this auto-erotic process is entirely normal blumenbach stated that nocturnal emissions are normal Sir James Perry declared that he had never known celibate men who had naught such emissions from once or twice a week - twice every three months both extremes peeing within the limits of good health while the Lord of Brunton considers once a fortnight or one someone about the usual frequency and these periods the emissions often following two nights in succession Rhoda believes that they may normally follow for several nights in succession Hammond considers that they occur about once a fortnight Rebekah regards ten to fourteen days as a normal interval lowenfeld puts the normal frequency at about once a week this seems to be nearer the truth as regards moves fairly healthy young men in proof of this it is only necessary to refer to the exact records of healthy young adults summarized in the story of periodicity in the brand vol it occasionally happens however that nocturnal emissions are entirely absent I am acquainted with some cases then other fairly healthy young men they seldom occur except at times of intellectual activity or of anxiety and worry lately there have been some tendency for medical opinion to revert to the view of Luther and to regard sexual excitement during sleep as a somewhat unhealthy phenomenon Maul is a distinguished and racket of this view sexual excitement during sleep is a normal result of celibacy but it is another thing to say that it is on that account satisfactory we might then Malda mark maintain that nocturnal incontinence of urine is satisfactory since the bladder is thus emptied yet we take every precaution against this by insisting that the bladder shall be emptied before going to sleep this remark is supported by the fact to which I find that both men and women can bear witness that sexual excitement during sleep is more fatiguing than in the waking State though this is not an invariable rule and it is sometimes found to be refreshing in a similar way eulenberg states the nocturnal emissions are no more normal than coughing of vomiting nocturnal emissions I usually do not invariably accompanied by dreams of a voluptuous character in which the dreamer becomes conscious in a more or less fantastic manner of the more or less intimate presence or contact of a person on the opposite sex it would seem as a general rule that the more vivid and relaxes a dream the greater is a physical excitement and the greater also the relief experienced an awakening sometimes the erotic dream occurs without any emission and not infrequently the emission takes place after the dreamer has awakened the widest and most comprehensive investigation of erotic dreams is carried out by Gulino in northern Italy and based on enquiries among hundred normal men doctors teachers liars etc who had all had experience of the phenomenon girly no-shows and erotic dreams with emissions whether or not seminal began somewhat earlier than the period of physical development as a certainty by marrow for youths of the same part of northern Italy go Alina found that all his cases had had erotic dreams at the age of 17 Mero found 8% of youths still sexually underdeveloped at their age and while sexual development began in 13 years erotic dreams began at 12 their appearance was preceded in most cases for some months by erections in 37 percent of the cases there had been no actual sexual experiences either masturbation or intercourse in 23% there had been masturbation in the rest some form of sexual contact the dreams are mainly visual tactual elements coming second and the dramatis persona is either an unknown woman or only known by sight and in the majority is at all events in the beginning an ugly or fantastic figure becoming more attractive later in life but never identical with the woman laughed during waking life this as Gulino points out accords with the general tendency for the emotions of the day to be latent and sleep masturbation only form the subject of the dream in four cases the emotional state in the pubertal stage apart from pleasure was 37% anxiety 17% desire 14% fear in the adult stage anxiety and fuel receded to 7 percent and 6 percent respectively 33 of the subjects as a result of sexual or general disturbances had had nocturnal ma without dreams these were always found exhausting normally erotic dreams are the most vivid of all dreams in no case was a knowledge of any monthly or other cyclic periodicity in the occurrence of the manifestations in 34 percent of cases they tended to occur very soon after sexual intercourse in numerous cases they were peculiarly frequent during courtship when the young man wasn't the habit of kissing and caressing his best one but ceased after marriage it was not noted that position in bed or a full bladder exerted any marked influence in the occurrence of erotic dreams recreation of the seminal vesicles is regarded as a main factor in germany' erotic dreams have been discussed by Vulcan and especially by lowenfeld while in America Stanley hauled the summarizes the general characteristics of erotic dreams in men in by far the most cases consciousness even when the act causes full awakening from sleep finds only scattered images single words gestures and acts many of which would perhaps normally constitute no provocation many times the mental activity seems to be remote and incidental and the mind retains in the morning knock laying exit perhaps a peculiar dress pattern the shape of a fingernail the back of a neck the toss of her head the movement of her foot or the dressing of the head in such cases these images stand out for a time with the distinctness of a cameo and suggest that the origin of erotic fetish isms is largely to be found in sexual dreams very rarely is there any imagery of the organs themselves but the tendency to irradiation is so strong as to reinforce the suggestion or so many other phenomena in this field that nature designs this experience to be long circuited and that it may give a peculiar ictus to almost any experience when waking occur is just afterward it seems at least possible that they may be much imagery that existed but failed to be recalled to memory possibly because the flow of psychic impressions was over very familiar feelings and this therefore was forgotten while any eruption into new or unwanted channels stood out with distinctness all the psychic phenomena although very characteristic of man in his prime are not so of the dreams of dawning puberty which are far more vivid I may further coat the experience of an anonymous contributor a healthy and chaste man between 30 and 38 years of age to the American Journal of Psychology legs and breasts often figured prominently in these dreams the other sexual parts however very seldom and then they turned out to be male organs in most cases there were but two instances of copulation dreamt girls and young women wear the usual romantic personally and curiously enough often the aggressors sometimes the face or faces were well-known sometimes only once seen sometimes entirely unknown the orgasm occurs at the most erotic part of the dream the physical and psychical running parallel this most erotic are suggestive part of the dream was very often quite an innocent-looking incident enough as for example while passing a strange young woman overtaken on the street she calls after means in question at first I pay no heed but when she calls again I hesitate whether to turn back and answer or not omission again walking beside a young woman she said should I take your arm I offer and she took it in twining her arm around it and raising it high emission I could feel stronger erection as she asked the question sometimes a word was enough sometimes a gesture once a mission took place on my noticing the young woman's diminished fingernails another example of fetishism was not being curiously attracted in a dream but the pretty embroidered figure on a little girl's dress as an illustration of the strange metamorphosis that occur in dreams I one night in my dream fell in love with a partridge which changed under my kerasys to a beautiful girl who yet retained an indescribable wild bird innocence grace and charm the sort of Andina these experiences may be regarded as fairly typical of the erotic dreams of healthy and chaste young men the bird for instance the changes into a woman while retaining some elements of the pod has been encountered in erotic dreams by other young men it has indeed remarkable that as deliberateness observes the bird is a well-known phallic symbol while Mader finds that birds have a sexual significance both in life and in dreams the appearance of male organs in the dream woman is doubtless due to the dreamers greater familiarity with those organs but though it occurs occasionally it can scarcely be said to be the rule in erotic dreams even men who have never had connection with a woman are quite commonly aware of the presence of a woman's sexual organs in May erotic dreams molls comparison of nocturnal emissions of semen with nocturnal incontinence and urine suggests an interesting resemblance and at the same time same in contrast in both cases we are concerned with viscera which when overfilled are unduly irritable spasmodically eject the contents during sleep there is a further resemblance which usually becomes clear when as occasionally happens nocturnal incontinence of urine persists until a childhood or adolescence both phenomena are frequently accompanied by vivid dreams of appropriate character with us in one case known to me a child of seven who occasionally wet up the bed usually dreamed at the same time that she wanted to make water and was out of doors running to find a suitable spot which she at last found and on awakening discovered that she had wetted the bed 15 years later she still sometimes had similar dreams which caused her much alarm until when thoroughly awake she realized that no accident had happened these later dreams were not the result of any strong desire to urinate in another case with which I'm acquainted a little girl rate after mental excitement or indigestible means occasionally wet of the bed dreaming that she was frightened by someone running after her and wetted herself in consequence after the manner of the ganymede in Eagles clutch as depicted by Rembrandt these two cases it may be noted belong to two quite different types in the first case the full-bladder suggests imagination the appropriate actions for relief and the bladder actually accepts the imaginative solution offered it is according to Pyrenees phrase some NAMM dualism of the bladder in the other case there is no such son and realism burrow psychic and nervous disturbance not arising in the bladder at all radiates convulsively and whether or not the bladder is over full attacks a vesicle nervous system which is not yet sufficiently well-balanced to withstand the inflow of excitement in children of somewhat nervous temperament manifestations of this kind may occur as an occasional accident up to about the age of seven or eight and thereafter the nervous control of the bladder having become firmly established they cease to happen the nervous energy required to affect the bladder surprising to wake the dreamer very rare cases however the phenomenon may still occasionally happen even in adolescence or later in individuals who are otherwise quite free from it this is most apt to occur in young women a human and waking life in men it is probably extremely rare the erotic dream seems to defer flagrantly from the vesicle dream in that it occurs in adult life and as which difficulty brought under control the contrast is however very superficial when we remember that sexual activity only begins normally at puberty we realized that the youth of 20 is in the matter of sexual control scarcely much older than in the matter of vesicle control he was at the age of 6 moreover if we were habitually from our earliest years to go to bed with a full bladder as a chaste man goes to bed with unrelieved sexual system it could be fully he has difficult to gain vesicle control during sleep as it now is to gain sexual control ultimately such sexual control is attained after the age of 40 it seems an erotic dreams with omission become more and more rare either the dream occurs without actual emission exactly as dreams of urination occur in adults with from bladder or else the organic stress with or without dreams serves to awaken the sleeper before any emission has occurred but this stage is not easily or completely attained st. Augustine even in the period when he wrote his confessions mentions as a matter of course that sexual dreams not merely aroused pleasure but gain the consent of the will not infrequently there is a struggle in sleep just as the hypnotic subject may resist suggestions thus a lady of 35 dreamed a sexual dream and awoke with our excitement again she fell asleep and had another dream of sexual character but resisted the tendency to excite and again awoke finally he should fell asleep and had a third sexual dream which was destined accompanied by the orgasm the factors involved in the acquirement of vesicle and sexual control during sleep are the same but the conditions are somewhat different there is a very intimate connection between the vesicle and the sexual Spheeris as I have elsewhere pointed out this connection is psychic as well as organic both in men and women a full bladder tends to develop erotic dreams Raymond and Janet state that nocturnal incontinence of urine accompanied by dreams are urination may be replaced at puberty by masturbation in the reverse direction Freud believes that masturbation plays a large part in causing the bedwetting of children who had passed the age when that usually seasons and he even finds the children are themselves aware of the connection the diagnostic value of sexual dreams as an indication of the sexual nature of the subject when awake has been emphasized by various writers sexual dreams tend to reproduce and even to accentuate those characteristics which make the strongest sexual appeal to the subject when awake at the same time this general statement has to be qualified more especially as regards inverted dreams in the first place a young man however normal who is not familiar with the feminine body when awake is not likely to see it when asleep even in dreams of women in the second place the confusions and combinations of dream imagery often tend to obliterate sexual distinctions however free from perversions the subjects may be thus a correspondent tells me of a healthy man a very pure character totally inexperienced in sexual matters and never having seen a woman naked who in her sexual dreams always sees a woman who with male organs though he has never had any sexual inclinations from men as much in love with a lady the confusions and associations of dream imagery leading to abnormal combinations may be illustrated by a dream which once occurred to me after reading jurists account of how a young [ __ ] who startled Marx he was sketching having become bored suddenly pressed her hands to her breath sporting two streams of lukewarm milk into his face and ran away laughing a dreamed of a woman performing a similar action not from her breast so ever but from a penis with which she was furnished again by another kind of confusion a man dreams sexually that he is with a man although the figure of the partner revealed in the dream is a woman the following dream in a normal man who had never been a wish to be in the position shown by the dream may be quoted a dream that I was a big boy and that a young boy lay closed beside me and that we are certainly he had seminal emissions I was complacently a passer and had a feeling of shame when the boy was discovered on awaking I found I had no emission but I was lying very close to my wife the day before I had seen boys in a swimming match this was it seems to me an example of dream confusion and not an erotic inverted dream end of autoeroticism part 1 section 3", "IlYeZuhMjkA": "it'll be still a couple minutes i think before folks showed up but um show up i'm i'm a patient man no worries um how's the night going for you guys so far so good yeah have you have you guys been shoveling uh thankfully no

plus program and um i got to do basically an hour and a half of shoveling as functional strength training so i killed all my rings today fantastic moment of pride um are we waiting for any more panelists or is this the bunch of us i just saw that andrew i think is is having trouble finding the link he might need it reset for from the joint no problem um sorry ashlyn that i didn't see your

audience on on youtube so you know when we kick off we can um mostly talk to them um i just want to get um that panelist link um i mean that uh i'll resend it to what would andrew he made andrew yeah okay send great considering it's a snow day we can hang out a little bit longer see if other people are going to show up and then we can kick off that sounds good it's all right maybe maybe waiting is a little bit silly because people can always jump in it's not a big deal yeah um all righty um so good evening everyone thanks for joining um i'm dr kaplan and i'm the host for this evening's discussion um welcome to dispensary highlights with revolutionary clinics um it's a mix of an open forum q a session and a chance for this fine selection of red clinic's employees to tell us about themselves and the company um it's also a chance to learn not just about the dispensary but also um about the benefits of cannabis and and and um sharing the kinds of perspectives and work that goes into the behind the scenes of a successful medical dispensary um and of course any other cannabis topics that that people want to raise um we'll kick off um an introduction to rev clinics um but for those who are with us live please feel free to ask questions either in the q a section or the chats um and we have some questions coming in through twitter and facebook and we'll see where that takes us for the brief time we have tonight um it's all being recorded so that people would like to get to know rev clinics can still watch tonight's discussion later on youtube um that link for anybody who doesn't have it already is is just bitly bit dot l y slash seed youtube um and the ced is capitalized that youtube isn't all right um any of you guys in particular want to kick us off i'm happy to do it i was just about to nominate you so hi everybody i'm barbara van hoosen i'm the senior wellness consultant at revolutionary clinics what i basically do is i help patients with consultations when they have any questions about our products about methods of consumption about the program in general uh navigating our menu we you know we do everything so most most of the time patients will send an email to our virtual consultation at revclinics.org and we set up an appointment but i do have amazing support and that joe casper is also on this consultation team and he is amazing so i'm gonna pass it on to joe thank you so much barb uh yeah i'm a new addition to the uh virtual consultation team as well as the overall uh remote team which is i think one of we're one of the only dispensaries that have uh this type of support right now to be able to offer to patients obviously we would all prefer to have these kinds of conversations face to face and be able to have these you know pleasant interactions where we're able to talk about the various things that people are looking for uh to help themselves uh medically but right now obviously that's just not feasible with covid so in terms of adapting to wild circumstances i'm super happy to be a part of this team and be able to offer that experience to patients virtually and give them the assistance they need because right now i think especially with all the new medical patients that have been coming into the program within the last few months you know for various reasons they're all brand new to this and they really need that kind of assistance to help them navigate the menu like barb said and really find the products that are best suited to them since it's just so subjective [Music] but uh speaking of adapting to crazy circumstances our delivery team has expanded exponentially over the last few months and one of the newest additions to the team i'll pass it off to ashland ashland right yes so my name is ashlyn rizl i'm the general manager for delivery services at rev clinics um i've been with the company now for a few months um but really excited to come on explain a little bit about how our delivery services work obviously um it's a great option for anytime you don't want to leave the house to get your medicine but also in this time of covid um and also preparing for snowstorms we are always around um we do offer deliveries seven days a week um and you can actually get delivery same day uh in some cases you can get delivery in 60 minutes um if you live in some of our zones we are starting to do 60 minute on-demand delivery so we're excited to provide one of the most robust um area coverage deliveries uh and same day with the lowest minimums in in massachusetts right now for our patients um so actually you know i'm curious joe you brought up these um these new patients that are coming in and that made me think of the beginning of covid and we all got this massive onslaught of patients who you know who were using medically although they hadn't registered for card they were sort of passing through the recreational line um i'm wondering if if you guys had reactions to that if you saw those patients and what sort of reactions they had these patients who had been consuming on the rec side what the reactions were now that they had medical cards yeah uh so i i've noticed some some pretty pretty stellar uh you know uh responses from uh patients and i mean staff alike i think we're all kind of you know uh excited to see this whole kind of this wave of new patients who are coming into the program whether it's because they you know during the initial part of the pandemic where the recreational dispensaries were shutting down they they needed a newer course to get you know their their medicine or or whether you know whatever it was um i think we're now seeing more and more people even just like learning about the medical program and realizing that it benefits them i think the more people who are you know getting involved even on an adult use level i think what happens is it sparks conversations that happen between friends and family i've i've talked to a number of new patients who you know were saw that you know one of their friends or one of their family members was really benefiting from medical cannabis and they thought well you know i'm dealing with something like chronic pain or or chronic anxiety maybe i should give something like this a try so i think it's really exciting to see more and more people kind of coming onto the medical train because i think we're seeing that people are are really excited for these these kind of different products that they might not have access to at adult use dispensaries um i know barb and i deal with uh uh well we talk to a lot of different patients you know who are dealing with things like like severe pain severe anxiety and sometimes they need products that have high concentrations of cbd or have different you know variations of cannabinoids that you're really you're not going to be able to find on an adult use you know side of things so for us to be able to cater to those types of patients and offer kind of a whole new world of products for them i think it's super exciting awesome awesome um do you have a sense of well what kinds of feedback is typical for you guys to get when people are talking about their experience at rip clinics i think that uh you know so during the shutdown of the recreational dispensaries we really pushed to make sure that patients knew we had the virtual consultation service since our doors were closed and we knew so many people were joining the program as brand new medical patients um what i've heard uh was basically patients were shocked that they could have this one-on-one conversation that you know i would take 45 minutes an hour whatever they needed to really walk them through everything to make them feel comfortable to ask to answer every question they had of course i know my boundaries and limits i always tell them i am not a doctor your cannabis clinician that certified you in the program is a great resource not just for that one day that you get certified so never be afraid to reach out with medical questions but what the patients i was speaking to were so excited about was having that direct line of communication um also having the discounts available having delivery having so many more options for products like joe was describing and i i would say about 80 percent of the people that i spoke to during the really thick of it when all of these new patients were coming in were dealing with anxiety and or insomnia and so you know it was it was a conversation i had over and over again and so many folks were just happy about the perks of you know they were used to standing in line for recreational product and to know that they could place an order for pickup and go during a time they selected um get you know fast-tracked that sort of thing and obviously have their medication during the the shutdown plus no tax you know it really opened their eyes to all of the benefits that they they just didn't consider before so the feedback has been amazing awesome great um you know i i've i've seen sort of red clinics grow up as i've been in the industry and it's it's really been awesome and and and great to see you guys shining as a quick leader um not just in the local area but the whole state um and part of that i i think is because of the way you guys are distributing products that i know that you guys wholesale products other dispensaries um and i've also watched um a lot of dispensaries start to now share products and and that was relatively new in the last couple years um you know although it was allowed you know if dispensaries ran out of product or were short they're they're legally allowed to have a certain limit of products but i've started to see sort of cross-pollination across the industry um so sort of two-part questions um where i guess across the state do you guys um distribute your products so people that might not be able to get to cambridge somerville where else can they find rev products but then also do you guys also carry other dispensaries products um and how does that how does that go how do you pick which products how do you you know how do people know about that stuff well we're actually the number one yeah and we're actually the number one wholesaler in terms of our products are in more dispensaries than any other in the state of massachusetts it's something we're incredibly proud of um in terms of who carries our products everyone from new dispensaries both medical and recreational who don't have their own production facility right it takes about several million dollars and a couple years to bring a facility like that online it certainly took us that long but in terms of uh whose products we're carrying you know we're looking to partner with really established brands both in terms of when we license products you know proven brands like moxie's mints some of the other brands that have really succeeded in other markets have been have been brought and we're really proud to license and then in other cases you know really it's about making sure we're covering the products that customers are asking for right no facility or company can produce everything and understanding where perhaps we had weaknesses once upon a time were backfilling like i know we just are about to roll out i think it's 13 new strain varieties that we're incredibly proud of we've had some staples on our menu star dog i think we're quite well known for uh gg4 uh don't forget bootylicious bootylicious rev clinic's original uh or or that we've had now for quite a while um but now there's like 13 or 12 new uh genetic strains in the pipeline that we're really excited about i was going to follow up with what andrew was saying uh so like i i myself i'm a flower guy so one of my things is you know going to different dispensaries all over the state and being able to try you know different varieties of flour and different strains and different brands and from the friends that i've made in the industry whether it's at different spenceries in on in western mass central mass uh or more closer to boston you know it's really exciting to hear that like and the reason i brought up bootylicious is because you know i have a friend who works at rise and amherst and one of the things that he's told me consistently is any time bootylicious ends up on their shelves it sells out like within a blink of an eye and i think it's just really exciting to know that we have that ability to reach you know patients across the state and adult use you know consumers across the state you know with different strains like bootylicious star dog and hopefully these new strains too and it's also exciting to see us carrying other you know cool brands you know like the heirloom collective and liberty strains you know and really being able to create that variety for patients because i think the patients like me who are primarily flower consumers the thing that we're always craving is variety we're always looking for different strains we're always looking for something that's different or something that's new and i think you know with the new stuff that we just got in all those new strains i'm personally really excited to try most of them i've already purchased quite a few i'm sure the rest of you have as well awesome um how does red clinics navigate um i guess the balance between stability of products that are well liked you know everybody comes they want you know these bootylicious kinds of products um but then an equally strong interest in in new products and sort of seeing what people might like and exploring new opportunities for strains and other kinds of products i think it's nice that you know those of us who talk to patients all day every day really do try to give feedback to you know the higher ups and our production folks and you know just tell them what patients are asking for it's easy to make well i'd say well it's easy but it's also difficult to try to guess what a patient wants or what might be appealing but really listening to what patients are giving us in terms of feedback it has been critical and so we've we've really do strive to listen to that feedback to incorporate it you know we're not perfect but we do our best to really try to meet those demands so i think that it's really great that we have kind of open lines of communication where those of us who are talking to patients all day are able to pass that upward yeah for sure and i know people appreciate that i've heard that feedback about the red clinic's employees that you know people are very friendly and engaging and open to listen and patient right growing a plant at scale and producing it consistently has unique challenges right this is not like a can of beans that we can just keep making again and again uh plants grow like on a i think it's a three to six month cycle right so let's say we have an enormous harvest 500 pounds let's say of one particular strain variety if we're doing it right we have several hundred pounds of multiple strain varieties that are dropping right i mean if we're doing it's it's one thing to be able to produce as you were saying dr kaplan the same thing over and over and over again but that doesn't actually address what joe and barb were talking about which is we need to also simultaneously have variety of products balancing those two ideas while remaining profitable while keeping the certain sort of you could say the hits on the shelf every day while you have sort of a rotating selection of other varieties that's a really big challenge that's a really big like supply chain challenge too um and then there's turning it into other products so so for what we are keeping on the menu consistently there's a couple of things that we're really proud of that we've managed to scale one of those is the cannabinoid cbn which is really known for sleep right i mean at the pro that we can't we still can't keep this product on the shelf consistently it's so popular but you sell someone an amazing fantastic night's sleep and then that product will just continue to sell out right like you give people an alternative from many medications i know my mother for example like was using i think it was either ambient or melatonin um but now she uses cbn to sleep cbn and cbd to sleep consistently through the evening right she she's an anxious sleeper she often wakes up she's got three kids everyone can benefit from a good night's sleep so we've actually converted parts of our production kitchen into just like a cbn production area right we're taking thc oil we're putting it on these lazy susans with this heated stir arm and they'll cook there for two weeks right we could take that thc oil today and sell it today or we could take two weeks and actually turn it into a product that has really high demand but but is also niche in a way so cbn and then cbd right is the other thing we're really proud of scaling up people always want cbd frankly there's never enough cbd products to satisfy i think the medical cannabis market because a lot of us are afraid i know i am of like the cbd you see in gas stations like i don't touch that stuff like i don't know where it came from i don't know how many times it's been white labeled or bought and resold and resold again and marked up so i'm very i prefer i only use um like certified like medical grade cbd and there's a really it's that growing cbd comes with its own set of challenges that are unique from growing thc um so there's a lot of challenges in the in the idea of what you've put out for us no no doubt i think i think really you know if if um the history of this country is any indication um back in i guess it's 1931 to 1934 when alcohol became legal um it was all about the bars and people getting tanked you know just like today in the wreck market is really all about thc sort of density um and over time you know different spirits evolved and i think over time also you know cannabis varietals will evolve and we're not going to see a really thc or cbd kind of you know unique market we're going to see a whole spectrum of major and minor cannabinoids i think flavonoids are going to start hitting the market and people will really be surprised i mean terpenes people know about um and there's some medical value there but really the big leap beyond terpenes is going to be flavonoids and um that market still being born i mean it's really you know it's a challenge for the growers and it's more a challenge for the sciences the scientists to convey the message but the whole industry has to mature um can can people request specific items or or products either from you know rev clinic's kitchen or other dispensaries we can't actually hold product for people but what we can do is if let's say we are out of our sleep tincture uh something that andrew talked about with the cbn in it very popular if we're out of that what we can do is we can add the patient to our we call it a callback list but we usually will call or email them at whatever their preferences and let them know as soon as it's back in stock and so we can do that for folks and if it's something we don't sell but patients have requests we definitely do take suggestions and recommendations and try to you know again pass that on but we don't actually like hold product for folks we just try to keep them aware of when we have something that we may have been out of and you know just really try to educate them on navigating our menu since it is directly tied to our inventory they can look and see if they see it on the menu it's in stock at that location so just trying to educate them on how to check and if it is something that you know they're worried about being able to get their hands on we let them know as soon as we can that it's back in awesome um what do customers do if they have questions you know if they're looking at the menu and they want to figure out i guess more depth about it what are their options right now they call us and joe that's where that's where barb and i really come in honestly uh especially like with the remote team right now if you call one of our stores more likely than not one of the remote team members will be actually answering your call somebody who's you know safe at home you know with the computer in front of them able to look up anything you know really kind of navigate our different systems to really kind of give you the best you know customer service experience you can get from like a medical dispensary which is really exciting because right now like i said before you know it's really sad it's it's kind of you know it's a bummer that we can't be there for the patients physically and be off be able to offer our recommendations and answer their questions but i am really glad that we've at least created this uh this you know virtual consultation team and the remote team to kind of you know address that uh especially now i think one of the major things that we're you know we're getting all the time you know like we said before is new patients who are brand new to medical cannabis and they need a place to start and sometimes you know we real we recognize that the best product for them you know like the sleep tincture it might not be available so right now something that barb and i do consistently that i i really love that we we have this you know kind of this this system set in place we like to give them kind of a utility belt of different information and different you know things to look for because we recognize that every dispensary is a little bit different every everywhere you go there's going to be a different range of products there's going to be different brands and it can be a little overwhelming if you're looking for something specific so we oftentimes try to break things down you know as much as possible for patients to really understand what it is they're looking for so that maybe if the mxr sleep tincture is missing they at least know oh do you have any other products that have cbn or you have other products that are good for sedation and by you know really kind of navigating the conversation in that way i think it's it's one it's educating our patient base so that they're better informed and and also it also i think invigorates the industry because if there are more patients out there asking for these products like high concentrations of cbd high concentrations of cbn i i would hope that it would actually invigorate the industry into providing more of those types of products and really getting them out there to the patients that need them because i think if these companies look around and see that there is a huge untapped market for these types of products they'll really get on board with creating more and more products and i'm all for you know seeing more products out there that are available to help patients agree yeah no i completely agree um what happens i mean does the remote sort of consultation work post purchase too if patients have questions about things they've purchased or concerns about them are you guys open to that too absolutely yeah our phone lines you know we we i think our phone lines turn on kind of early before we open um and then they close shortly after our um online ordering system shuts down so you know as joe mentioned we do sort of miss seeing our any you know our kind of beloved uh you know patients who've come back again and again plus meeting new faces as well but you know just to keep everyone safe having the virtual ability has been great so folks can call that phone line they can actually speak to someone on demand um lots of the phone calls that come in are basic questions like you know are you wreck or you know what are your hours right but every now and then you'll have a patient who just has a couple of questions we can handle that if it's really detailed where they want a consultation they can either have an on-demand consultation with joe or um if he's not available they can and i and i might be available then they can make an on-demand uh consultation with me or i just call them back or set up a time and we have a nice thorough conversation and that is again it could be post purchase it can be before they go in at any point you know i've i've done consultations with patients that i remember you know seeing for the past two years at rev but something new has come up in their lives that they really don't know how to handle or um you know they're just kind of thinking about varying things a little bit with their product consumption and maybe they're you know dipping their toe into something new maybe they've never tried edibles before and so they really don't even know where to start so absolutely at any point in their experience we have folks who are dedicated to the phone lines we have an email box which is just info revclinics.org like i said our joe and i are available through virtual consultation at revclinics.org but certainly on the phone you can get information from amazing uh knowledgeable patient advocates as well yeah you don't wanna if you don't wanna speak to someone on the phone there's also an online chat right you can go to the website and you can get um zoomed right in basically to the same group of people right but we're serving both people who prefer to speak on the phone we're also serving people who prefer to email we're serving people who prefer to have the instant chat um excuse me just to interrupt you andrew if you do decide to speak to the the chat box i will let you know you still are speaking to myself or one of the remote team members we're just you know we're hidden behind the the shroud of technology so that you don't have to worry about that awkward human interaction it's all it's all digitized that's funny so you know speaking of of these interactions i'd love to get a sense of not just the usual like you're certainly not the ones which are um you know are you wreck are you open um but what are some of the more interesting conversations you've had with with patients or maybe some some great distances i guess that you've helped patients climb you know i mean i know we have a lot of cannabis curious and sort of cannabis anxious patients um i wonder if you could share some stories um that have been memorable for you yeah i was gonna say i got one i know you do too because i can tell by your smile um i have i'll give a really quick one but it's it really did kind of touch me and make me happy so when i was um in the dispensary one day answering the phone there i spoke to a woman who she was older she was very anti-medication um you know i don't take any medications i've always been healthy and you know she doesn't put anything in her body but she has really bad arthritis pain and you know different things that were bothering her so she did get her medical card she really wanted topicals because she didn't want anything that really you know made her feel high that she felt like she was consuming medication so we talked for a very long time about topicals and you know one of the things that we do is and i think joe's already kind of touched on this we i don't just educate patients on what we have to sell them i will happily explain products to them knowing we don't have that and say you know you might be able to find this elsewhere or i know you can find this elsewhere that's something we don't carry right now or you know whatever um so i don't want people to think that i'm trying to sell them our product i want them to be educated so that they can be in charge of their well their wellness first and foremost um so anyway long story short she was very much i don't want to put anything in my body i don't want to be high so we talked about her using some topicals i gave her my direct phone line uh my cell phone number and you know she called me back the next day asked a few more questions she called me back a week later asked a few questions and then two months later she called me and said now tell me maybe i will try something that might make me feel a little high and so she was open to trying some things now because she was starting to come around to how much relief she got from this topical that i'm not sure she fully believed in you know it really doing a great job with giving her pain relief and then she just started to open her mind a little so it was really kind of sweet and funny to me that she did such a 180 uh in about two months so that was fun i will say that is my favorite is when you have somebody who's like i don't want a single drop of thc in this i don't want to be high i don't want to feel anything psychoactive if i see any slight variation of the colors in front of me i will be calling your manager like you know there are people like that and that's totally fair but you know it is always great when they end up coming around and say you know what you've broken down my my barriers give me a five milligram gummy i'll give it a try and then you know it really does open up a whole world of uh you know new products to try and new experiences to try but um i actually i have an anecdote a very recent uh conversation with a patient this is actually a two-parter so in response to your previous question about you know kind of like follow-up consultations or post-purchase consultations this one i think is a really fun example i got a call from a patient i think they just they called online i don't even think they reached out to the virtual consultation email so they were really just like looking for anybody to talk to to to get this process started as a matter of fact actually i don't even think they had acquired their medical card at this point so they just called basically looking for somebody to talk to and looking for some answers i think one of their friends had their medical card and they were talking about different variations of of cbd and thc being really good at helping relieve their stress and relieving their pain and helping them get a good night's sleep this of course sounds really appealing to anybody but this particular patient was really fascinated and wanted to know if this was possible and she was really particularly interested to know if if it was possible to have something that would help her you know deal with pain deal with stress during the daytime i think she was also taking some kind of other medication that was that was really causing the anxiety so this was really something [ __ ] that was that was causing her a lot of stress and a lot of a lot of frustration she wanted to know if there was a product out there that had you know little to no thc but that would help her medicate throughout the day which of course we do carry which is you know we have the harmonized tincture which is a four to one cbd to thc ratio we also have like two to one uh gummies the cucumber watermelon so these products exist so all sometimes you really need is to be able to tell the patient like there are these products available for you and she ended up trying these products and emailed me back like she i think she actually i don't know which doctor she went to i apologize if i didn't send her to you dr kaplan uh but she ended up getting her certification got the temporary id so that she could you know use the two-week temporary registration for these purchases she was able to purchase some some gummies and some and some tincture emailed me about a week later saying hey the tincture worked so well i had the first great night of sleep and and probably weeks the only problem is now i have a bit of a stiff neck do you know if you can recommend a cream or a topical for me and that when i saw that in the email it just it made me laugh because i was like astounded that this person who had you know been kind of a skeptic at first you know enjoyed this product so much that now they needed a different product for an entirely different problem that you know was just a a an accidental side effect of of having too good a night of sleep it's funny and your response of course was well why yes i do have a topic of course we have a topical for that it's fun you should ask yeah absolutely so one of the things that that often comes up in in consultations you know in in medical visits is an explanation of what all this stuff is about why are there so many choices what does it mean why does one person pick another and you know the the patients who are watching um know my spiel and sort of know my explanations but i don't often ask the dispensaries sort of what they're describing and sometimes i hear discrepancies um and the interest for this question is actually not to sort of find discrepancies but i'm genuinely curious um you know what's your what's your observation about the people i guess who may purchase some of the different varieties of products on the menu for example like flour is different from wax concentrate or hash concentrate or keef um for your from your perspective what draws people to some of these different um methods of consumption i i think i i pretty much start my conversations with people where i'm asking them a couple of questions what are your goals with using cannabis and what are your boundaries is there anything you want to stay away from you know some people don't want to smoke some people don't want to vape some do not want an edible so i try to find where's their comfort zone and also what are their what's their goal what are they hoping to achieve with cannabis and then i i try to give them just kind of a basic foundation and um you know i tell folks listen stop me if you already know this if it's too much information i can move you know fast forward a little but i try to explain the difference between you know inhalation in terms of onset and duration uh versus the kind of other end of the spectrum for onset and duration and edible that you have to digest and then where tinctures fall so i try to explain to them in terms of how quickly you'll feel the effects potentially how long that effect might last what could affect those things you know how many inhalations you're taking how big of a draw or inhalation you're taking etc if you have food with that edible if you snack after the edible you know just different things that patients have reported over the years that i've been with rev and in my own experience personally so i try to give them a foundation and you know joe mentioned the utility belt i want them to really walk away from the conversation with me with having an idea of a few options i always stress to patients you know everyone's different and how you process thc is going to be different from the next person and it does not matter how big or small you are so you know your experience is going to be very different trial and error take some notes it doesn't have to be a long journal entry but note how much you took what time um you know maybe if you ate if it's an edible that sort of thing so that you can look at patterns and really try to find that sweet spot that works best for your body and staying nice and comfortable and starting very low and slow and you know not jumping ahead big big leaps and bounds so i really try to make sure people are are educated to know how they can be in control of really trying out some things you know folks will say what are these concentrates on your menu and if it's somebody brand new to cannabis who's already you know kind of telling me they really don't want to be high they don't mind feeling a little bit of the effects of thc i'm like well maybe concentrates aren't a conversation for right now they're not really step one or two but we can always you know i explain to them what those are and and most you know what most patients use them for and how they consume them um but yeah that's sort of the way i approach things i'm not sure how you know other folks feel about tackling that question but yeah go ahead andrew go ahead i just remember uh there was a customer uh before i actually when i was working at a different marijuana clinic dr kaplan you actually came in and did a talk for us and you were talking about the different kinds of uh patients like folks who are medical consumers who are basically trying to solve a problem in their life right they want the same experience every single time that's one block of customers the other group of customers we might call these people more traditionally adult use i think was your framing um but they're the folks like like joe was describing who wants something new and different every single time right so different form factors like flour like barb was saying are much more like step one and two right so you have lower dosages of thc that your body is absorbing now because you're absorbing less the same deal with alcohol right like any drug the lower the dose you ex you absorb the less you feel what we call psychoactive effects the fancy word for stony like getting high effects um so concentrate i knew people who came in every day and they needed cbd shatter right like they had such a high tolerance to thc that the whole point of concentrated mary is that you are concentrating a large quantity of flour into a very very very small form factor of uh processed product so by taking a dab which is right just a term for a very very small what we sometimes describe as half a grain of rice's amount like that's what a dab should be when you're first starting out the point is that that dab is probably the equivalent of several grams of flour potentially all in one shot so if you imagine let's say a mouse and an elephant and they both need to take medicine right you might use a different size pill for the mouse than you would for the elephant and that really is like the difference between flower marijuana and concentrate marijuana how big a dose all in one shot all at once do you need to give that customer and to barb's point you want to generally ramp up very slowly because you can start with concentrates but if you do that it's going to skew your tolerance very very quickly and then the other important thing to remember is that tolerance tolerance does not translate across form factors that's what barr was alluding to earlier with just because you've been smoking flour for 30 years suddenly you eat an edible like it is a very different bodily system right we're talking about our lungs with inhalation and flower that are doing the absorbing like thc is moving through our like alveoli like facts in our lungs to hit our bloodstream versus your stomach which is breaking down an edible by using stomach acid to like break down thc so that it can bond to a fat and then your stomach lining can absorb it those are very different bodily systems and so you have a different reaction to absorbing via those different methods there are a couple people actually in tonight's audience that saw our talk i think it was last night even it might have been the night before where we did a talk about actually about tolerance and and i was teaching folks about um there are at least 14 different ways that people can manage tolerance um and and then tea breaks everybody knows about but they're they're 13 others um yeah so it's a topic fun is one of those right like uh ingesting high doses of cbd as a way to lower a thc tolerance that was one of the first things i learned uh in a dispensary yeah varying dosage varying strain just like you mentioned or two of a bunch um you know it seems it seems impressive and wonderful that you guys are also knowledgeable um i haven't seen that at all dispensaries and i know that's um something that's important to rev clinics is to have the staff that's sort of supremely educated um but i'm curious about the process of teaching and support that's available for you guys um you know what does red clinics look for basically in in helping all of its staff seem so so knowledgeable and at the cutting edge sure before andrew jumps into this because he is definitely the one that takes the lead of this process um when you join rev i as i mentioned i joined in september um i have no cannabis background and very little usage of the product myself prior to joining um i will say though i feel fully confident now talking to patients and and helping them um not on the scale that barb and joe would do but comfortable talking about the different products and what they do um but i i will say the training program that andrew can talk about for a second it it's very fast and very um well done to be able to learn about something that you may not know anything about coming on board yeah so my role at uh revolutionary clinics is training and professional development manager i like to the elevator pitches i make people and systems better is my goal and so that starts with orientation and education so we have a really fantastic 30 page like very beautiful pictures like very one concept two concepts maximum per page and i like to describe this funnel right that when people start with this um sort of and whether you're an entry level new hire or you're the chief financial officer of our organization no matter what your cannabis background is or experience level you start with this 30 page beautiful booklet and then the booklet basically starts sort of like a funnel right if you think about the wide part of a funnel where the most infer the most people will probably start with flower where people mostly think that they know something right we start with sativa indica and hybrid and those sort of words that we say over and over and over again in our industry but breaking down what do they actually mean like there's a smaller group of people who actually understand that sativa and indica mean very different things to a marketing person in the cannabis industry than they do to a grower in the cannabis industry right like a grower or a production person will tell you any tall thin cannabis plant that's ativa any short squat plant we can get into geography because there's also historical like geography that goes into these genetical lineages of plants but right mark to market most marketing people like the what has happened over the last couple years the last decade or so is that we've learned that it's sativa anyway so it starts with a lot of education around starting with uh flower what a lot what a lot of people think they know and then digging deeper into edibles concentrates and then specifically what is the cannabis industry standard right like folks in the cannabis industry make edibles in a very particular way because we need to produce tens of thousands of units right like if you're a bespoke um chef who's making one brownie at a time you can use a very different process than we can so so also digging into what are the specifics of industrial cannabis and then what are the further refining that what are the specifics of revolutionary clinics as processes right so we use co2 we don't use butane to produce our concentrates which you could you could dig in a whole hour just on concentrates but that's what that packet does is it starts with a very broad overview and then refines and refines and refines and what we found is that team members figure out what they're interested in and they get a really broad base on everything but that allows team members to specialize and suddenly you have like a person on the floor who's got a really broad base on everything but individual team members are self-educating themselves suddenly we have a master on edibles suddenly we have a master on topicals and rev clinics is really amazing about giving folks the platform to become that subject matter expert and then be elevated for it i've certainly seen that happen for barb and joe but i talked to him i talk too much no it's great i mean it's it's wonderful for me and for everybody else to hear um you know i i i can't help but think about how far rev has come i mean from actually from an early age i sound really old saying this but you know i've gotten to watch rev sort of grow really wonderfully can you give a sneak peek i guess about where things are going from here i mean obviously the industry is changing by leaps and bounds and you know perhaps we have uh national legalization kind of around the corner um but i'm curious if if you guys have um an insight into you know where things might be going with rev in the near future i was going to say ashlynn um you know i think that one of the biggest things that i've seen so i've been with rev just over two years when i started we just had our summerville location and i started with andrew with joe and then you know we opened our uh faucet uh street fresh pond cambridge location and you know just watching us grow into three locations watching our delivery going from one tiny vehicle to uh you know the expansion that's happened the delivery service has been amazing so ashlynn please talk about how we've grown delivery that's been phenomenal yes so um our really goal is to strive to be not only the most robust and convenient and prompt but also the friendliest medical delivery that that we have in in massachusetts it's great it's a very discreet service the vans nothing's marked um we've got great team members that actually do the delivery they're very very friendly and very knowledgeable themselves they are trained um the the people actually doing the delivery to doors are trained as pas um prior to everything um it's great it's the same experience that you get coming to the store and that you can use cash you can use your debit um we have um the loyalty points and recertification and new patient discounts it can be the exact same but what we're finding is not only um especially for certain medical patients who aren't able to get out or have a caregiver that are at their house um during the day obviously that's where we started was was to bring it to people who couldn't come to the dispensaries um as covid has shown us nobody's leaving their house um anyway so we we've definitely been able to ramp up we actually out of somerville and fresh pond now we're running six vans um we can see that quickly growing um we've expanded our delivery areas to add additional times as of tuesday this past week we launched 60 minute delivery which we think will be a game changer um it's out of summerville so it's a lot of uh zip codes right around the summerville store into like uh maine downtown boston um and the neighborhoods of boston in there but we're very excited to be able to you know if you want it you can come onto the website say i want this now and get a delivery within 60 minutes um we're definitely trying to expand but we're proud to offer same-day service you can place an order up until about 5 30 um and get it that day uh barring that we're not already full uh that is starting to happen more and more but we are working to expand our our fleet and everything else so that that's not the case um we want to be able to offer it as long in the day as possible um but it's really exciting to see patients call us so that they're like thank you for making my life easier and bringing this medicine to me we cover as far as salem marblehead north reading up to linfield we are adding zones all the way up to lowell and we are looking at the south shore for potential expansions coming forward but to be able to take ref products to people who either are too far away from dispensaries or can't get there for whatever reason um it's very exciting and we're excited to be able to offer more and more in that field as we grow but i will say just like the stores we are focusing really hard on on covet safety um to keep that going um a lot of patients order delivery because they're high risk and don't feel comfortable coming to the curbside to the stores to pick up um so we make sure that that that's available um and we're expanding um our rev access card is a great product too for patients that it's 99 for the year we're offering the free delivery with that you get a free grammar equivalent for the month um and we've got a number of delivery patients who continue to to use that service to get their deliveries without any kind of fee to it with with the low minimums that we have um so it's very exciting to to continue to come up with ways that we can better serve people outside of just the dispensary walls um and and really looking to to grow that service to to cover as many patients as possible and as quickly as possible and i'll tell you i have a rev access card it it's i'm such a frugal person spending 99 um you know it has to be really worth it for me and that card is so worth it as ashland said 15 you get every month a free gram or 15 the equivalent off of your order and you get free delivery for the entire year so i've had delivery probably three times in the last few months because i work from home now full-time and i have a child who's doing remote learning full-time so it's it is difficult to get out during the day you know i'm busy and to get delivery right to my door every time it happens i just say what a time to be alive it's it's wonderful the staff is amazing um it really it's i'm so proud of the way we've grown delivery and and how well um you know all of our my colleagues you know they're just they're phenomenal people so and delivery is really how we're expanding within the bounds of massachusetts you asked dr kaplan about like what is the future for rev one of the ways that we are looking to the future not just for rev but really for the whole cannabis industry i want to toot joe and barb's horn right is this remote team i'm not sure i i jumped on a little late but this remote team is answering fifteen thousand fielding fifteen thousand calls a month and that number is going up every month so for us creating one eight hundred cannabis creating an information center there are we're thinking about how can we sell a product outside the bounds across state lines right you can't no state in the union nobody can sell cannabis across state lines but you can sell cannabis services across state lines right like imagine if you're opening a dispensary in pennsylvania you're opening a dispensary in michigan new jersey florida anywhere in the union um you need to like what we've seen that's been incredible right is by creating this remote team suddenly hundreds of phone calls that were coming into our retail facility those phone calls are being handled by dedicated phenomenal like extraordinary customer service professionals suddenly you imagine if you did not need to train your team members in a store how to answer uh product questions right you what if you just needed them to be face-to-face customer service right if people are coming into a store you want to give them the best face-to-face customer service imaginable you don't want your customer service providers distracted by a ringing phone constantly right so selling that service building that like multi-state cross-state service of education cannabis as a as a across state line product that's really the future we think for both rev clinics and for the larger cannabis industry just to follow up on that i will also say like especially right now with these extraordinary circumstances i think it's phenomenal considering like how stressed out everybody is right now how frustrated frustrated we all are with the current circumstances you know of 2020 you know i think it's great that you know despite all that if you're if you're having some some struggles whether you're a new patient you don't know where to go to to get these questions answered you're having issues and you need them resolved it is so wonderful that we can provide these you know friendly voices over the phone you know who can really help you i think i i notice you know you know over and over again we'll get you know people calling in and they're stressed they're in a rush they they don't want to take up anybody's time any more than they have to and they start with just one question usually it's like oh how late are you open or oh can i place an online order after you close like it's usually just a very simple question i'll we'll start talking for maybe like a minute or two and i'll just you know simply ask like do you have any other questions is there anything else i can assist you with and that that two minute conversation will turn into you know a 30-minute consultation because now they have somebody that they can actually speak to and they can really ask their questions and this is honestly you know no matter where you go you know whether it's to you know to best buy or to you know a dispensary like i would say you know it's tough to get really good customer service right now because everybody is is pulling their hair out just because of the year we've had and i think now to have this you know service where people can talk to somebody and really get their questions answered and get that really positive customer service that that's unmatched anywhere else you you go so i'm really proud to be able to provide that type of service to patients and really kind of help ease their stresses if they usually start a conversation or call stressed out or frustrated i usually am able to get them laughing by the end of the call so that's usually a good sign to me and how incredible and how incredible to have a business recognize the value in providing that customer service right you know i in addition to i wear several hats at revolutionary clinics i'm also the lead wholesale client trainer and so i get to walk into dispensaries and see how other businesses in massachusetts operate and i will tell you i have heard so many times i have heard these like okay you get to have 15 minutes with the customer if you're a minute over that you lose seven employee points if you hit negative 15 employee points that means you're talking basically it's like we want to provide great customer service because that's what's going to bring people into our store back for our products and sort of differentiate us really because everybody's got great cannabis right massachusetts market is exploding it's really funny i went last year pre-pandemic i went to amsterdam and they had massachusetts and california marijuana like in amsterdam right that this the script has been flipped um from the idea that uh amsterdam has the best stuff um so yeah i'm just really proud of what barbie and joe do every single day it's really incredible to be able to provide that i i think one major thing that's been a big focus for us in the stores um is the lack of being able to be face to face with people and having that family feel you had your store that you would you know you go by the dispensary every week every two weeks every month and you knew your bud tenders you knew your pa as you knew your receptionist it was a family and it was comfortable to go into the dispensaries um we've lost that a little bit now with pre-ordering and curbside pickup however i really do like that when i talk to patients it's amazing on delivery um i i work with the dispatch team regularly so i'm seeing the patient's names come up and you recognize names over and over um people call i i can tell you like who loves you know on everything that you know i'll get a call from somebody and they're like well i was just talking to gabby or i was talking to barbara i was talking to sabrina and it's not well there was this woman that called me it is still that family feel people know that they can call in and place their orders um over the phone not to do it online and and to call um they've got the same drivers and jumpers that are coming out to them so we we've definitely i think done really well to keep that family and that that cultural feel um even though we're all separated right now so that's that's been something that i've really been excited to see um because it helps us too i mean we're stranded during this pandemic too and we're not seeing faces as much as we are so it's been nice to to have that family feel and that comfort level with with so many patients through this awesome um one of the things that's close to to my heart um obviously are sort of medical um perspectives and illnesses and sort of treatment plans um and you know you guys talk about the cbn and i think that's a perfect example of how the industry is very um slowly i think both in the sense that it's approaching slowly but also it's been long enough that this you know my in my perspective should have been part of the industry right from the beginning but um the question i'm getting to is is you know what products do you have i guess besides the cbn which is clearly oriented towards sleep um what products are sold that have a focus on certain medical illnesses as opposed to sort of more general applicability i guess yeah my first thought is the delta eight thc like tincture that i think just rolled out which i think has a variety of uses but i know it's one of the most medically focused products frankly since we broke grant on cbn that we've been really excited to explore right i mean i think what you're getting at dr kaplan is sort of a little bit of what i was talking about earlier right we have a scalability problem right you have a customer base a medically focused customer base who needs the same product he's very intensely interested in the same product every time but they are a much much smaller group than the group of people who wants to buy thc every single day so there's a there's a finance question of where do you put resources so that you can serve the broadest group of people the most consistently um and i'm really frankly proud to sing the praises for our production and logistics teams in our grow like we have seen them 10x production um like mo tenfold grow like month over month like frankly like they break they break records every every every month and we're like incredibly proud of them for that um i remember when we never cracked 17 percent like it was a big deal when we broke 18 19 thc and now really like we're seeing well numbers aren't first of all phd numbers are not the most important thing i'll say but it is indicative of the overall improvement that we've seen in quality of flour and quality of edibles that we're producing like we're now producing fruit shoes that you can um consume without teeth right like you can actually get through them if you have gums like we're starting to put real thought on who are the customers that we're trying to serve how can we include like i think the the most exciting product i know that's in the pipeline because we've had gluten-free we've had vegan products for a very long time but right like the low sugar like mountain the low sugar like challenge with the cannabis industry right is that you've got cookies you've got brownies you've got gummies i mean there are cannabis patients i'm sorry cancer patients out there who need high sugar right like their particular diet needs high fat content high sugar because they're wasting away there's another group of cancer patients who they can't have a drop of sugar right for those people for everyone frankly the whole there's a whole group of people who want edibles and are really relegated to tinctures as their only low sugar option not everybody wants a tincture there's a lot of people who want to like consume like actually consume like i think we're working on this basically fruit leather that has like um that basically is low sugar low fat low everything but is still very flavorful and delicious and that you can get through without needing dentures so again it's like all of these incredible challenges that are about like okay first how do we solve the challenge then how do we scale the challenge and then how do we consistently produce it on a timeline every single time and how do we get all of our supply chain to line up at exactly the same time right there's a lot of problems there um that it requires a mature organization to handle for sure and i'll put it i'll put a special vote because a lot of my patients are taught about dhcv um and there are you know three or four products in massachusetts which have anything close to one percent there's a huge market um you know not just existing market for the appetite suppression but also the whole diabetic market and there's a lot of literature that points to thcv and the trpv4 receptor stimulation that will be i think cultural changing it's really it's it's a breakthrough opportunity um you know it's it's a difficult plant to find um but um you know there are strains around and i would love to see some of that come into massachusetts um you know there's a company out in california that is producing high volumes of thcb and i know that they've licensed in massachusetts but i don't know who or where and it's all kind of under the radar um but perhaps the company name uh the thc producer david olympic um okay uh he owns or runs uh california cannabinoids and the product is doug's baron out of there i think they have vapor pens that are you know upwards of 30 percent thcv wow no kidding um yeah i mean for the whole world uh really like i know contacts in spain and australia that are hungry for that too and you know he's wisely keeping his you know there it's not just his their crops quite well protected um but i but i talked to him actually recently and he's he has licensed it here um but i don't know who we're aware and i'm i'm just waiting i i feel like on that same note like cbg is kind of on that same level of like being a really undervalued cannabinoid i know i i've read some places it can be good for gastrointestinal type issues um that's another you know cannabinoid that i say you know when you're looking on the cannabis market especially massachusetts you might see it in a like a couple percentage points right of of cbg um so i don't know i think it's i think it's cool that it's like you know it's one of those things that are steadily becoming more and more you know recognized and like i said before you know i think as as long as we keep informing our patients that you know these things exist they just need to be produced then i think if there's more of a demand for it then you know somebody will will come along and say there's a market let's let's tap it so i mean i i would hope that there would be you know a future market for those you know really kind of underutilized cannabinoids i i for one am really happy that we are even you know producing like andrew was saying like cbn at scale because i mean i've been working like barb you know with barb and andrew we've been working for the company for over two years and as we've seen you know the company grown internally you know and interacted you know all three of us have you know started front facing you know working with patients either as patient advocates or working reception and so we we have these conversations all the time about you know what patients are looking for what what do they really need and it's it's you know when you look at all the products available in massachusetts and you have these conversations you realize well after having these multitude of conversations where people are looking consistently for products that help with pain products that help with anxiety and products that help with sleep those are the top three i would say you know it really boils down to those high concentrations of cbd and cbn because really like like with our tinctures to harmonize the sleep these are the products that are consistently being asked for you know as somebody who helps patients sign up for our patient call back list you know i see those products listed over and over again because those are really the products that patients are banging the door down for and they they run out within you know weeks of returning to our sales floor so you know it's one of those things where as long as i i think we keep informing patients we keep advocating for patients um and you know get that information out there and they know and they demand for it i would hope that you know like we've scaled up our cbn production in response i would hope that more companies and more more dispensaries even across the country especially as we see federal legalization is is looming on the horizon i prefer one very optimistic you know i would love to see you know more of these types of cannabinoids being appreciated and recognized as mainstream and therefore being you know having more of a market for them yeah i mean i'm i'm personally making that a mission um i have um not to shamelessly self-promote but i will shamelessly self-promote i have a book coming out um that's going to be aimed at the over 60 crowd over 50 60 crowd um and really helping them understand what's what's real what's not real what's available what's not um what the state of the industry is in in jargon free language and and also hippie free language um just sort of to get to their ears um that's the fastest growing it's the fastest growing slice of the cannabis market right is the folks over 60 the folks who are looking for quality of life improvement people who generally can garden more can can be on their knees more can be more flexible like that is what cbd and thc are offering like a whole group of people who who never considered or maybe who were raised with propaganda uh about about uh cannabis um were taught that it had no medicinal value uh when clearly there's mountains uh there's there's been for generations mountains of anecdotal evidence and now um researchers doctors like yourself dr kaplan are like really bringing a lot of us into like the light of the modern age i agree and actually sort of writing on that comment um you know it's important for patients to understand um you know who are subject to that that history of stigma that they understand that this is a very private protected industry in massachusetts i mean as it is everywhere but especially here um what sorts of privacy protections um can customers expect from rip clinics working reception i feel like uh barb and i could absolutely take that um so it starts with um uh right um hipaa training by understanding what information like we are a medical facility we we do have very intense record-keeping policies and procedures um it starts with like i i make this one of the very first things that every team member learns in training orientation is that we never say first and last name right we always say uh hello first name or hello mr or mrs in fact we don't really use last name we use first name and nickname unless a customer is going to say that that's what they prefer but from record-keeping procedures what information now everything is actually digital right we used to have pieces of paper that we had really stringent policies on um if someone had entered their information that paper did not see the light of day right no there was no way for another customer to see that that there's no way for customer a to see customer b's information period stop um but now that everything is digital there's not even paper records to lock up right like we have um actual backup copies but yeah patient information is extremely private and where we do have to still use paper so on the delivery side regulations do require that a manifest go out with each delivery to say what the van is carrying what people are involved in carrying it and who the in just like taking it from our facility our production facility to a dispensary we have to have that record those manifest one we make sure we all that um exactly what the patient um ordered so that it was dispensed correctly through the ccc for their allotment so we're checking that on a regular basis um and then also all of those documents are locked away filed we have to keep them for so long for the ccc but everything is kept away patient names aren't displayed we make sure even in the facilities we're not leaving screens open with patient names on it um it's very important that nothing's left out with patient information on it so it's something that we focus on and have the walk away ability for anything that does need to go that way yeah and the folks who do want to get um a callback or an email or a text when we have product back in stock that they're looking for we always make sure we're using whatever method of communication is something that they have agreed to so can we leave you a message at this phone number yes you know do you want us to email you text you we ask them you know so that we are being very mindful of their privacy um and uh you know not using let's say a phone line that might be open to other people who would be like what you got this call from a a place called revolutionary clinics so we're very mindful of making sure that we are abiding by whatever is their comfort level for contacting them and reaching out to them and not like leaving them a message saying your marijuana is here or you know anything um that might be problematic the van doesn't have puffs of smoke coming out it does not a flashing green light i know your your marijuana is here no the one good thing with delivery um so we are not um legally allowed to nor would we want to um blast the name actually there's no name on the van the only thing that's on the van is the van number that we have internally um so your neighbors it could be an amazon delivery it could be whatever sometimes people are like please don't pull in the driveway or please you know people are worried if their neighbors or their housemates or sometimes parents or whatever are are going to see that the people that still live at home it is very discreet our delivery team are allowed to wear whatever they uh they're allowed to wear their own clothes however they look professional um they're not rolling up to your house like a drug deal is going down um it is very discreet um and and we we make sure that it's a very professional experience and that people um have their privacy even when it's open in the public like that and they also have masks and face shields right ashland i know you talked earlier about safety but that last interaction like when they're at the door with you first of all that we don't go in the building like customers come out to us and um it's really a really really incredible experience so dr kaplan you asked about privacy but i also want to talk about safety right like that's one of my favorite things to talk about in massachusetts is the reliability and safety of cannabis products and there is no state in the union with more stringent testing requirements than massachusetts it's one of the reasons that massachusetts is the model for states burgeoning cannabis markets like pennsylvania and michigan i keep mentioning them but they actually those states have said like you know colorado california those folks are way too liberal for us but you know good old puritanical semi-liberal massachusetts those folks know how to slap a regulation on somebody um and so like i love telling people that listen the only part of this process that we have zero control over is the third party independent testing right we test for heavy metals we test for carcinogens pesticides like that's in contrast to what we i like to jokingly refer to as maine the wild west cannabis state where you have zero testing regulations whatsoever you have no idea if there's like mouthwash or heavy heavy metals in what you're smoking but in massachusetts like there's there are multiple systems set up in place where there is no way for a product to even get to our shelves let alone get to a customer without it first being vetted by a third party independent like state laboratory whose whole job right is to send up a red flag if anything any any um micro trace of something turns up in the the rather large sample that we have to provide so i love talking about the safety and consistency like it's one of the reasons that frankly i don't think i could ever move anymore to a state without some form of legal cannabis program i i'm not going back to a dealer system i'm very happy being able to walk into a brightly well-lit store or order from my phone and get delivery right like i'm not going back from that yeah no agreed awesome this has been a really fantastic discussion tonight i i um i think it might be one of my favorites i mean we've had so much fun and partly it's because you guys are so much fun and there's so many of you um my last question is actually going to be for for each of you and it's and it's it's a challenge um and i really want you guys to come up with three products from that you think stand out and whether it's of your own preference or what you've seen from customers um but to name that product and then why i got it i already i already have it i have mine all right so uh everyone laughs and jokes about how the our infused hazelnut is like my favorite uh edible that we sell it's a hazelnut spread it's infused and when you know it's one of those things where pretty much every patient i would talk to in the dispensary would end up leaving with it not really but um it's so for me it's great because it's very tasty it does not taste like cannabis which i want it to taste yummy and not like a plant it is great because i can low dose or high dose depending on my needs i tend to medicate in the evening for chronic pain issues and for sleep so i can you know kind of take a quarter of a teaspoon a half teaspoon or i can do a tablespoon whatever fits my needs it's easy for me to adjust that dose so i love the infused hazelnut for relaxation for sleep for pain relief and you know a nice little tasty treat so there's my number one my second one would be our quench one to one tincture so that is equal part cbd thc it has these lovely limonene terpenes in it so a nice little daytime uplift and i personally use it to help with migraines so if i feel a migraine coming on i try to take a small amount of the quenched tincture and usually within about 20 minutes i can feel the tension that's building at the base of my skull start to melt away and instead of feeling kind of like i have a migraine hangover where i'm foggy brained i get more clarity because of those sativa terpenes so i don't feel uh the psychoactivity really because the cbd is helping to pull back the psychoactivity from that thc i can stay functional clear-headed focused and without a migraine pain-free which is fantastic for me so my third one i thought i had it now i'm second-guessing myself okay no i do have it so we have a one-to-one vape cartridge that's called clementine one to one i'm a big fan of cbd mixed with thc so i love our clementine one-to-one cartridge it's fantastic for me for anxiety if i do want to have just a small little puff or maybe more it's also very euphoric for me and very happy and blissful the clementine strain itself so i feel very happy i like people um i like i love life and also i'm able to pull back any anxiety that i have with that clementine one-to-one cartridge all right i'm gonna go before since i since i'm the new one and i have my favorite so i i'm actually an edibles person i i cannot smoke i i've tried it multiple ways with my asthma my lungs just do not like it um so all of my experience with it personally and i think it's great because i a lot of older patients that i talk to um are people similar to myself that don't smoke to have good options my number one right now is the four to one harmonize tincture i know we mentioned it earlier i am swearing by this product right now i actually personally have been going through i have an ulcer um so my doctor put me on about nine pills a day to manage this um going through it which i'm still doing that but even the zofran all that nothing helped with the constant nausea feeling and i was not hungry and this has all been in the last few weeks and that harmonize i have been using it's got a um um essential oil blend in it that's called digest then which my great aunt swears by and keeps sending me um to like put on my chest and all of that for heartburn it actually has that mixed in so it's got a peppermint a ginger kind of a tarragon flavor to it um you can put it on your tongue it is oily so i i do put it in tea but it's going to sit on top but that's an easy way to consume it but that has been better than anything that's been prescribed to me for my digestive issues lately and the other good thing is being newer to cannabis i didn't know or i was worried about having a product because this isn't just at night using a product during the day and being able to use that product and still work the four to one cbd um that's been a great thing so i can meditate i'm not going to get high from it i'm not going to have that feeling and i can work and it's just a wonderful product my second favorite um actually is a smokable in a way it's a newer device that rev has licensed and brought to massachusetts and that's the omora device so it is a function we have pre-loaded uh paper flower sticks that actually have the flower already ground and put into these one-time use um flower sticks they just slide straight into the device and it's it's a heat not burn process so you're not really getting smoke plus it is only a three minute time session so it heats up it vibrates it lets you know every minute it counts down it turns off after that it's very low juice but for someone who cannot smoke i wanted to try some nice i needed a quicker quicker than i can do an edible um i needed a quicker response to something so that's been really good and we actually have bootylicious sticks we have meltdown sticks that you can use those flowers because i'm not able to experience those in other ways um the amore has been great and i think it's great that they're expanding the market of ways to consume to allow people who don't normally choose a certain method to experience that method so i've been really impressed with amora for beginners or non-smokers my final product is something that i just think is fun and i haven't seen a lot of other places and that's our stir it up um tincture drinks there there it is a liquid form um we carry a raspberry a watermelon and then a ectoplasma neon green tangerine flavored but you can mix that i've mixed it in soda water ginger ale sprite different things and it's a great alternative to edibles at night and it's something that it it's not too oily so it actually mixes in with your drink and diffuses through it adding raspberry to the sprite is fantastic all the flavors are wonderful but i i really appreciate that if something that i can put a drink and consume an edible a different way um than just chocolate bars and gummies and brownies and cookies so those are my three i gotta say y'all are making this so hard you're taking all my favorites uh that's why i went quick seriously seriously those are some good ones i was also gonna shout out the stir it up i i'm not a drinker at all uh even through college i'm the type of person i would maybe sip on a side or in the corner of a bar i would never really like i never was really much of a fan of alcohol so when we came out with this product a little over a year ago back then it was called slurpee terp uh rest in peace slurpee terp what what a great name uh anyways the stir it up for me was such a great product because it was really it was a cocktail replacement you know something for me i'm you know pre-covet i was a very social person i like to hang out with friends and so for me to be able to have a glass of my hand maybe put a little bit of the watermelon stir it up in there mix it around and get that kind of infused beverage i wasn't i was anybody i wasn't even aware that that was a product available anywhere let alone here in massachusetts and lo and behold we're the ones creating it um so stir it up i'm gonna just second that one because that's a such a great product um my second uh top choice for me so i'm not usually super into cartridges uh and i know there's a lot of you know skeptics out there you know post the the vape band that we experienced in the like the past year um but for me you know i i i am going for a cartridge my favorite cartridges that we produce are the full spectrum cartridges my personal favorite like barb is a one to one it's the orange tied full spectrum cartridge for me like barbs was saying it's a very uplifting strain without you know causing any kind of stress or paranoia and that one-to-one balance is really really fantastic for me in terms of helping me ease my anxiety and help me get my throat get get through my day um and we used to have orange tide as you know a pretty consistent strain of flower i'm hoping and praying that that comes back because for me the orange tide was something i could you know i could take that during the day whether i'm smoking or vaping it and really kind of go through my day clear-headed and still medicated and still being able to focus and get things done um and i just like i'm a huge advocate for the entourage effect so to have that full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes just straight from that flower i will advocate for that that particular type of cartridge for any patient who's looking to get into vaping um but then my final choice and it is a strain of flour and i just want to preface this by saying if anybody out there is looking for something you know festive to do with all this snow if you have a bong at home now is the perfect time to to make a good old-fashioned snow bong literally all you have to do is go outside get a little cup stuff some snow into the neck of that bong get make sure it's clean snow no yellow snow for this but if you smoke through the bong with snow in the neck it will be one of the smoothest smokes you will ever experience just be careful not to take too much but it will be a very very pleasant experience i'm a singer i'm a performer i do improv in the pre-covet days so it's something that i can do on a regular basis whether it's with snow or with ice and i still preserve my lungs for the most part of my vocal cords without feeling vocal fry or or feeling like i'm drying out my my throat too much it's it's an experience i very much recommend but all that aside chocolate oranges is a great strain of flour yes that's right tom watch out for that yellow snow uh really chocolate oranges for me it i i'm i'm pure i'm mostly medicating to help with anxiety and depression those are my two you know main focuses and oftentimes i think with medical cannabis it's kind of like it's a balance you know because some products that are good for depression might exacerbate anxiety and vice versa so chocolate oranges for me is kind of like a nice balance it's it's technically an indica but it's it's a strain that's giggly it's social it's very fun it's not the type of indica that leaves you stuck in the couch or or feeling like you have to take a nap it's very much a type of indica where you can still function maybe enjoy a movie or play some video games depending on what your preferences are but chocolate oranges is for me will always be my my go-to get home from work and de-stress type of strain not to say that working in the cannabis industry is stressful wow i guess i'm up you guys have picked uh almost all the good what now i was gonna say so many more there's so many more i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready for this i know you can think of something so i've got three so the i'm going to also start out with a cartridge i'm a big cartridge user just for the convenience i'm someone who's like we were talking about safety and like testing earlier i'm very comfortable because i know exactly what is in every vaporizer cartridge that comes out of revolutionary clinics we've never used cutters thinners like uh like gel replacements of any kind you know we were actually born right right so the vape gate that joe was alluding to 2019 revolution like massachusetts had its own version of vapegate back in 2017 when i first joined the industry i remember working for patriot care and patriot karen neta had put out the very first cartridges in massachusetts and anyone who was in the market at that time remembers like they were thick as tar and they were black because nobody on massachusetts knew how to make a quality cartridge yet everyone was using thinners they were using peg polyethylene glycol so the the the vape gate crisis of 2019 is just a rehash of like we had to keep anyway so i'm very comfortable and very happy because i know that they're like the very high quality of product that we're producing today at rev clinic so for me the newest cartridge that we're producing is actually called the astaria sleep cartridge so we talked about cbn and how we've been scaling up our production of cbn the astaria line it's a brand new sleep brand that we are launching it's going to be an edible product a tincture product a vaporizer product flower product we're basically trying to create sleep as a brand because we understand that everyone needs sleep and so what's special about astaria is that it's actually a three cannabinoid blend right so it's four parts thc to two parts cbd to one part cdn so the idea is that the cbd is going to reduce inflammation the thc is going to help with relaxation and then the cbn is going to help with uh sleep and so that you are going to fall asleep stay asleep and get really thorough like sleep so i know that our vp of product dan gillan and our vp of marketing tom have been working we're working on that product for months um to sort of perfect this particular ratio this particular blend of cannabinoids um but to me that's sort of taking what we've learned about cbn and taking it to the furthest like elevation and evolution that we have so far so really special medically focused uh concentrate uh cartridge that i think is going to really like awaken a lot of people to the magical powers of cbn so that's product one uh i would say uh product two i gotta say about the tiger gold bar so a lot of folks on this call have been shouting out micro dosing products i wanna talk about macro dosing for just a second for all of those people out there who are not necessarily so new to the cannabis space folks who like me i need 50 to 100 milligrams right we we recommend a starting dose of cannabis as 2.5 to like milligrams really like a baby's teaspoon just to get you started into edibles we'd much rather you feel nothing the first time with an edible than feel too much right it's much easier to convince someone to try just a little bit more let's just dial up let's titrate right that fancy talk for dial up your dosage very slowly to find what's the optimal dose for you for me i know my dose it's 50 milligrams at 50 milligrams i'm i'm spoiled i have access to really high quality consistently dosed edible products it's another reason i would never go back to gray or black market edibles but for me i don't want to eat an entire chocolate bar right every time i want to try an edible and if you're in the adult use market that's what i would basically need to do is i would need to either eat like 50 milligrams would be half a chocolate bar or an entire chocolate bar so our tiger gold bar it's with a peanut butter base with a dark chocolate swirl and a toffee crunch through the bar it is absolutely delicious you cannot taste one trace of cannabis in there but one single piece it's a thousand milligrams and then in one chocolate bar about this big which means one piece is 50 milligrams so for me i can pop one piece you know it's a very specific product for a macro dose customer but that's going to be my number two for products i'm really proud of and it's something that you can only get in a medical dispensary in massachusetts um and then product three i'll do a flower strain i've treated add i've been diagnosed with pension deficit disorder going back to about the age of 10. so i've always been a fast talker a high energy individual and i use medication to manage my symptoms like on a daily basis but i really adore high energy sativas right like indicas like knock me out and i use them for sleep in certain situations but what i'm going to day after day like my daily driver strains are all sativas um and for when i'm trying to relax but also have that sort of like wide-eyed exhilaration that i love um for me that's mr clean that thing is liquid rocket fuel right like i tell people like if you need to sit still for any reason this is not the strain for you if you want your eyeballs to vibrate that's mr clean like you need to clean your apartment you need a workout you need motivation to do something that's mr clean and for a lot of people people think of cannabis as like oh you know stoners like that's what cannabis is they just sit on the couch like a lump they don't do things like i'm a stoner who does things i do things all day long i'm a really active i'm an active cannabis user and i'm very active while i consume cannabis it's a big part of my life and for me having a variety of not just something to put me to sleep i do need that just like the vast majority of customers but i also i love products that get me moving that like energize me to take on the day and for me that's that's mr clean really high energy wow that was just an awesome um review not just of of you guys as sort of individuals and your perspectives but the products and really the company that's sort of behind them making them so i think i'm glad that that worked out to be such a fantastic last um send-off um that should be your closer doctor i guess maybe now it will be um that was i mean that was really remarkable the staff really enjoy the products that the company is producing for sure for sure no agreed um and i just i didn't realize we blew way past the hour mark so that's also a sign of success um well thank you all for for for for speaking and so sort of you know thoroughly and

of early American literature commonly include texts by Alvar nu\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca and samuel de champlain alongside english-language texts by thomas harrot and john smith moreover we are now aware of the wealth of oral literary traditions already existing on the continent among the numerous different Native American groups political events however would eventually make English the lingua franca for the colonies at large as well as the literary language of choice for instance when the English conquered New Amsterdam in 1664 they renamed it New York and changed the administrative language from Dutch to English from 1696 to 1700 only about 250 separate items were issued from the major printing presses in the American colonies this is a small number compared to the output of the printers in London at the time london printers published materials written by new england authors so the body of american literature was larger and what was published in north america however printing was established in the american colonies before it was allowed in most of England in England restrictive laws had long confined printing into four locations where the government could monitor what was published London York Oxford and Cambridge because of this the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier and their provincial English counterparts back then some of the American literature were pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both the European and colonists audience Captain John Smith could be considered the first American author with his works a true

Mather the first book published in North America that promoted Newton and natural theology was Methos the Christian philosopher 1721 the enormous scientific economic social and philosophical changes of the 18th century called the Enlightenment impacted the authority of clergymen and Scripture making way for democratic principles the increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time in 1670 the population of the colonies numbered approximately one hundred and eleven thousand thirty years later it was mauled and 250,000 by 1760 it reached 1 million six hundred thousand the growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies these new ideas can be seen in the popularity of Benjamin Franklin's autobiography even earlier and Franklin was count Wallander Colden 1689 to 1776 whose book the history of the five Indian nations published in 1727 was one of the first texts critical of the treatment of the Iroquois in upstate New York by the English Colden also wrote a book on botany

Ames James Otis and Patrick Henry are also valued for their political writings and durations early American literature struggled to find a unique voice in existing literary genre and this tendency was reflected in novels European styles were frequently imitated but critics usually considered the imitations inferior part three first American novels in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the first American novels were published these fictions were too lengthy to be printed as manuscript or public reading publishers took a chance on these works in hopes they would become steady sellers and need to be reprinted this scheme was ultimately successful because male and female literacy rates were increasing at the time among the first American novels of Thomas Atwood Diggs Adventures of alonso published in london in 1775 and william hill brown's the power of sympathy published in 1791 brown's novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related this epistolary novel belongs to the sentimental novel tradition as do the two following in the next decade important women writers also published novels Susannah Rosen is best known for her novel Charlotte a tale of truth published in London in 1791 in 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title Charlotte Temple Charlotte Temple is a seduction tale written in the third

popular in a time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel Charlotte Temple is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction hannah webster fosters the Coquette or the history of Eliza Wharton was published in 1797 and was also extremely popular told from Foster's point of view and based on the real life of Eliza Whitman the novel is about a woman who is seduced and and and Eliza is a cocky who is courted by two very different men a clergyman who offers her a comfortable domestic life and a noted libertine unable to choose between them she finds herself single when both men get married she eventually yields to the artful libertine and gives birth to an illegitimate stillborn child at an inn the Coquette is praised for its demonstration of the area's contradictory ideas of womanhood even as it has been criticized for delegitimizing protests against women's subordination both the Coquette and Charlotte Temple are novels that treat the right of women to live as equals as the new democratic experiment these novels are of the sentimental genre characterized by overindulgence in emotion an invitation to listen to the voice of reason against misleading passions as well as an optimistic over emphasis on the essential goodness of humanity sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature while many of these novels were popular the economic infrastructure of the time did not allow these writers to make a living through their writing alone Charles Brockden Brown as the earliest American novelist whose works are still commonly read he published Weiland in 1798 and in 1799 published almond Edgar Huntly and Arthur Mervyn these novels are of the

psychology Melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation in Moby Dick an adventurous whaling voyage becomes the vehicle for examining such themes as obsession the nature of evil and human struggle against the elements in the short novel Billy Budd Melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion onboard a ship in time of war his more profound Brooks sold poorly and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death he was rediscovered in the early 20th century anti transcendental works from Melville Hawthorne and purl comprised the dark romanticism sub-genre of popular literature at this time American dramatic literature by contrast remained dependent on European models although many playwrights did attempt to apply these forms to American topics and themes such as immigrants westward expansion temperance etc at the same time American playwrights created several long-lasting American character types especially the Yankee the Negro and the Indian exemplified by the characters of Jonathan  and Metamora in addition new dramatic forms were created in the Tom the Showboat theater and the minstrel show among the best plays of the period

considered the first internationally acclaimed American poet being the first American poet given a bust in Westminster Abbey's Poets Corner Walt Whitman 1819 to 1892 and Emily Dickinson 1830 to 1886 two of America's greatest 19th century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style Walt Whitman was a working man a traveler a self-appointed nurse during the American Civil War 1861 to 1865 and a poetic innovator his magnum opus was leaves of grass in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular lengths to depict the whole inclusiveness of American democracy taking that motif one step further the poet equates the vast range of American experience with himself without being eget is tickle for example in song of myself' the long central poem in leaves of grass whitman writes these are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands they are not original with me in his words Whitman was a poet of the body electric in studies in classic American literature the English novelist D H Lawrence wrote that Whitman was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something superior and above the flesh by contrast Emily Dickinson lived the sheltered life of a genteel unmarried woman in small town amidst Massachusetts her poetry is ingenious witty and penetrating her work was unconventional for its day and little of it was published during her lifetime many of her poems dwell on the topic of death often with a mischievous twist one because I could not stop for death begins he kindly stopped for me the opening of another Dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male-dominated society and an unrecognized poet I'm nobody who you /eu nobody to citation needed American poetry arguably reached its peak in the early to mid 20th century with such noted writers as Wallace Stevens and his par Mon Ian's 1923 and the Aurora's of autumn 1950 TS Eliot and his the wasteland 1922 Robert Frost and his north of

to be born away from the East Coast in the border state of Missouri his regional masterpieces where the memoir life on the Mississippi and the novels Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Twain's style influenced by journalism weighted to the vernacular direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous changed the way Americans write their language his characters speak like real people and sound distinctively American using local dialects newly invented words and regional accents other writers interested in regional differences and dialect with George W Cable Thomas Nelson page Gerald Chandler Harris Mary Noelle's Murphree Charles Egbert Craddock Sarah Orne Jewett Mary E Wilkins fremen Henry Kyla bonnet and William Sydney Porter oh Henry a version of local color a journalism that focused on minority experiences can be seen in the works of Charles W gist not african-american of Maria Ruiz D Burton one of the earliest Mexican

laughin and his workers editor of the Atlantic Monthly Henry James 1843 to 1916 confronted the old world new world dilemma by writing directly about it although he was born in New York City James spent most of his adult life in England many of his novels Center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe with its intricate highly-qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance James's fiction can be daunting among his more accessible works are the novellas Daisy Miller about an American girl in Europe and the turn of the screw a ghost story realism began to influence American drama partly through howls but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola although realism was most influential in set design and staging audiences loved the special effects offered up by the popular melodramas and in the growth of local color plays it also showed up in the more subdued less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche the most ambitious attempt at bringing modern realism into the drama was James Horner's Margaret Fleming which addressed issues of social determinism through realistic dialogue psychological insight and symbolism the play was not successful and both critics and audiences thought it welt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes such as the main character nursing her husband's illegitimate child on stage part seven beginning of the 20th century at the beginning of the 20th century American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass

mid-19th century came from finding distinctly American styles and themes writers from this period were finding ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene not as imitators but as equals something similar was happening back in the States as Jewish writers such as Abraham Cahan used the English language to reach an international Jewish audience American writers also expressed the disillusionment following upon the war the stories and novels of f scott Fitzgerald 1896 to 1940 captured the Restless and pleasure hungry defiant mood of the 1920s Fitzgerald's characteristic

reporting with poetic beauty Agee presented and accurate and detailed report of what he had seen coupled with insight into his feelings about the experience and the difficulties of capturing it for a broad audience in doing so he created an enduring portrait of a nearly invisible segment of the American population Henry Miller assumed unique place in American literature in the 1930s when his semi autobiographical novels written and published in Paris were banned from the us although his major works including Tropic of Cancer and black spring would not be free of the label of obscenity until

to Sylvia Plath's the bell jar the perceived madness of the state of affairs in America was brought to the forefront of the nation's literary expression immigrant authors such as Vladimir Nabokov with Lolita forged on with the theme and at almost the same time the beatniks took a concerted step away from their lost generation predecessors developing a style and tone of their own by drawing on Eastern theology and experimenting with recreational drugs the poetry and fiction of The Beat Generation largely born of a circle of intellects formed in New York City around Columbia University and established more officially sometime later in San Francisco came of age the term beat referred all at the same time to the countercultural rhythm of the jazz scene - a sense of rebellion regarding the

southern author Walker Percy winner of the National Book Award was his attempt at exploring the dislocation of men in the modern age in contrast John Updike approached American life from a more reflective but no less versiv perspective his 1960 novel rabbit runned the first of four chronicling the rising and falling fortunes of Harry Rabbit angstrom over the course of four decades against the backdrop of the major events the second half of the 20th century broke new ground on its release in its characterization and detail of the American middle-class and frank discussion of taboo topics such as a della Torre notable among uptick as characteristic innovations was his use of present tense narration his rich stylized language and his attention to sensual detail his work is also deeply imbued with Christian themes the two final installments have the rabbit series rabbit is rich 1981 and rabbit at rest 1990 were both awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction other notable works include the Henry Beck novels 1972 98 The Witches of Eastwick 1984 Rogers version 1986 and and the beauty of the lilies 1996 which literary critic Michiko Kakutani called arguably his finest frequently linked with Updike is the novelist Philip Roth Roth vigorously explores Jewish identity in American society especially in the post-war era and the early 21st century frequently set in Newark New Jersey Roth's work is known to be highly autobiographical and many of Roth's main characters most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman are thought to be alter egos of Roth with these techniques and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture his most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels the controversial port noise complaint 1969 and goodbye Columbus 1959 among the most decorated American writings of his generation he has won every major American literary award including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel American pastoral 1997 in the realm of african-american literature Ralph Ellison's 1952 novel invisible men was instantly recognized as among the most powerful and important works of the immediate post-war years the story of a black underground man in the urban north the novel laid bare the often repressed racial tension that still prevailed while also succeeding as an existential character study Richard Wright was catapulted to fame by the publication in subsequent years of his now widely studied short story the man who was almost a men 1939 and his controversial second novel native son 1940 and his legacy was cemented by the 1945 publication of black boy a work in which Wright drew on his childhood and mostly autodidactic education in the segregated south fictionalizing and exaggerating some elements as he saw fit because of its polemical themes and Wright's involvement with the Communist Party the novel's final pot American hunger was not published until 1977 perhaps the most ambitious and challenging post-war American novelist was William Gaddis whose uncompromising satiric and large novels such as the recognitions 1955 and jr. 1975 are presented largely in terms of an attributed dialogue that requires almost unexampled reader participation Gaddis primary themes include forgery capitalism religious zealotry and a legal system constituting a sustained polyphonic critique of modern American life Gaddis work though largely ignored for years anticipated and influenced the development of such ambitious postmodern fiction writers as Thomas ping John Joseph McElroy and Don DeLillo another neglected and challenging post-war American novelist albeit one who wrote much shorter works was John Hawkes whose surreal visionary fiction addresses themes of violence and eroticism and experiments audaciously with a narrative voice and style among his most important works is the short nightmarish novel the lime twig 1961 part 10 post-world war ii chapter 2 short fiction and poetry in the post-war period the art of the short story again flourished among its most respected practitioners was Flannery O'Connor who developed a distinctive Southern gothic aesthetic in which characters acted at one level as people and at another as symbols a devout Catholic O'Connor often

themes focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism against the backdrop of the nuclear age other important practitioners of the forming include Catherine and Porter Eudora

streaming tool and recording like most like most of them do I've been using Wirecast for so long right and then the Ustream producer is essentially Wirecast that's what I've been using and then but if you're using Ustream like the service you're paying a lot right this and YouTube live streaming it's essentially free right and yeah oh I see here twitch as well which of course that's uh that's a big busy stay that is making a living playing video games on Twitch yeah but if you if you ever go and watch one of these things you don't have to be a video game fan but as a producer type the very common layout is obviously the games in the background but the player the person playing typically is green screened inlaid into the game it's very cool yeah I'm sure it OBS plays a role in that yeah I mean I don't know if they have you know I remember the Kinect had a tool that did automatic green screen but you know it found the edges of your body basing the calculations of you know wood but it wasn't all that good so to really do it right you do need a green screen behind you that's lit behind you and then you have to be lit as well you know but I don't know maybe they've got some stuff in here that does it I have no idea I haven't I haven't I installed it I started going through the wizards and stuff I haven't used it but people I know that do this for a living swear by it hmm I should we should poke Jeff Fritz about that one of these days because he's been doing a twitch livestream coding and I wonder if he uses OBS to do that good fine dude yeah glad you bought this link that one

to see where the bottlenecks and their productivity are sending out surveys and following up on survey results and to follow up on problems that people are having a lot of customer interviews and I write a bunch of apps myself to put myself in the customers shoes and then yeah we and then like do a ton of design work on like for example one of the big things we're doing now is the code style configuration and enforcement so how can we make developers more productive by making it so they don't have to think about making their code base consistent it just will be the other one is trying to figure out how we can make our intellisense experience even better which is another big thing that we can designing and like how can we modify the ranking algorithm if we change sort order will that you know make people angry will they notice and things like that so it's all about testing these waters before we actually ship it all out do you find that when you're talking to customers and talking to developers that or when you're watching them try to be productive that they don't even know about some of the things that Visual Studio has in there like that they could they just if they knew about and somebody said hey do that you know wow I didn't know about that all the time which is why I sort of have recently I'm sort of turning into a marketer because we're realizing the biggest problem that we have is discoverability of our stuff hmm and so people be like if only you had extract method and it's like oh we've had extract method for years so it's trying to figure out how to make these things better yeah yeah so like one thing we did for example with refactorings is when we went to Roslyn we didn't actually make the light bulb up here if a refactoring was available right so right now like if your cursors in a spa like in a squiggle or whatever a light bulb will appear and it has a code fix or refactoring that you can apply but for factorings we didn't pop up that light bulb and because that no one knew or were factoring was available so we actually did like an a/b study where we popped up the light bulb for a certain amount of people for refactorings and then saw like every refactoring like doubled in usage and like tripled and frequency like it looks like huge difference just by popping up the light bulb and making it more discoverable so we're always trying like little things like that it's improve discoverability so what are some of the other productivity things that people might not know about or that that you are extremely excited about well though probably one of the top ones that people ask for that's not exciting at all and has been the product for ever is to sync your active file in the solution Explorer so a lot of people want to see their file in the solution Explorer like where it is in their file hierarchy right but they don't know that there's there's an option to always keep them in sync and there's also a keyboard shortcut to sync them but that one's like a kind of unsexy feature that people just don't know about what I like I think a ton of the refactorings like every point release so we've been shipping Visual Studio at a faster cadence down than ever before thank you fast yeah great like people some people even complain it's like too fast but as a product team member it's great because people will ask for things and now in like three months we can get it out to them or less and we can get people like experimenting with new things that we have faster and so every point release we're always putting out more code fixes and we're factorings and I think those are the things that are really helpful to developers as they're writing code mm-hmm this code style configuration features so this is literally we set rules on the way code supposed to look and you can't compile until it complies basically we're we're still working on it but right now you use what we're called there's a open source file format out there called editor config hmm a lot it works on the cross like every single editor and lets you set like UTF settings newline your indent style indent size and so those are like the kind of basic core features that our card editor config raises yeah exactly you know age old battles and then we worked with the editor config community to extend it to work with dotnet code style hmm and so that's what you let you do now so now you can set almond braces first kar you can do naming conventions in there you can do var vez barbarous explicit type to be another kind of one of the code war things that people have I believe that editor config was Mads Christensen right mmm so we wrote all the editor config you stuff Mads kay wrote a language service to help you use our new rules okay and that's just because we just haven't had time to build all of it in and so he just went and like hard-coded a lot of the rules in there so that as you're typing you get nice colorization and code completion for if you want to enforce it at the error suggestion warning or nun level and things like that okay yeah the I think one of the the this really came out of the Java Python world trade hunter in it how can our hunter and a few other guys it's a big open source project but it's cool to be working with it too yeah it's like the benefit is you know the editor config file travels with your source code so anyone who clones or repo will get it and if they're in you know Visual Studio then it will enforce all of those things meet all those code style rules so it's like really great for open source authors for example who you know have all these pull requests that come in but you know they're not consistent with the rest of the code base which makes it harder for people to read and contribute to the open source code in the future mmm what we're working on now with that is currently if you set something as an error it won't actually break your build mark each pipe editor config support through the compiler so that it will be enforced at the compiler level and so that if you do set something as an error it will break your code so if you want to be a real stickler we got you yeah not just popping warnings but like new will not compile yep and the other thing we're working on there is so now if you make a bunch of things errors like the nicest thing they can do is have a button to fix everything at once especially if it's like formatting related or like tactic only so we're working on a code style cleanup feature as well which we're calling like a fix all of fix all because like right now you can fix all violations of a single rule you can't fix all violations of all rules is something that Microsoft would use internally I mean I know you guys actually build Visual Studio with Visual Studio right yes like we dog food everything so like all of Rosslyn for example we all write in Rosslyn or and it'll see it yeah yeah I think the number one productivity tip that helped me was using that quick launch bar and just searching for things yeah I controlled to you to find your options yeah rather than just going through all the code and looking for stuff manually it's just easy yeah on that same kind of wave we have control T which is go to all formerly navigate to which was control comma and that's another feature that we've been putting a lot of investment in because people just want to be able to quickly navigate to a file or a type or a member and it just quickly allows you to do that and so we've been doing a lot of work on changing the sort order in there so it works better for camelcase matching and finds what you need faster and line to filter by different categories and things like that yeah do you find yourself running up against stuff like code rush and refactor when you start getting into this kind of thing of optimization and productivity enhancements or is that just you know part of the business you mean in terms of like extensions doing similar things yeah no like most of them are partners with us a lot of them are using Roslyn which is sorry the whole reason we made Roslyn so that anyone could use these compiler api's to write their own code generation tools or their own code analysis tools and so that's just really contributing to the ecosystem that we already have and to help people you know write net better and faster there are a lot of third-party tools that do telemetry you know in our timing it's always a mystery to me not always but you know it used to be and it can be if you've got stuff that's happening on other threads stuff that happens sort of in real time things slow down you can't really step through them and test them you do have code analysis now in Visual Studio how is that going to help me in terms of like profiling yeah exactly so right now I don't actually think we do a lot of profiling for like like the debugger profiler is different than the Roslyn one and things like that because the Rozlyn is dotnet specific and most Visual Studio Tools need to actually work with all language is hmm right yeah it's not a part of the challenge what we are we can now performance wise with code analysis is I believe are working on a profile right now where we can tell so a bunch of people like anyone can write a Rosslyn analyzer which allows you to plug into the squiggles inside Visual Studio and the lightbulb so you can write a diagnostic to squiggle a violation inside your code and then you can add a fix for that diagnostic in the lightbulb menu and so anyone can write one of these but sometimes depending on what kind of action you're registering or your code action to it may have a negative perf impact and so we're working on making a profiler right now so that people who are writing analyzers can tell you know oh was this the right you know should I use compilation start action here or compilation end action and figuring out like oh what are the performance hits based on which one I do so that if you are running you know this huge code analysis on the entire solution you're not you know killing your your you know customers machine all right I guess one of the things I realized with Rozlyn is this code analysis effect that you're literally just compiling the code behind as we write it so we're getting good assessments you don't have to do that old-fashioned compile look at the warnings look at the errors kind of thing right we're working to tighten the feedback loop essentially because development is you know come on those weird forms of creation where it's not like painting where the second paint hits the canvas you get immediate feedback on where you're going and as you're you know brushing your paint brush across the canvas you can course correct they add your code you just kind of code and kind of hope for the best like build and then you get to see something even then you might have to interact with the result in order to see if you've got the results you wanted and so that's what we're trying to do is really tighten that feedback loop by providing more info as you're writing code which is where the code analysis stuff comes in we're now doing that you know the live code analysis so as you're writing code we can tell you oh that's a syntax error or you know I think you actually want to do this or this looks like a typo so as you're typing you can now get closer to the results that you need and we're doing this with like live unit testing as well that's cool yeah yeah we've done a couple of shows around some of the new testing features that are built into studio but I think they originally came out of the MSR group didn't they these do you pump you deal with that where it's stuff gets built elsewhere and then you get inside of Microsoft you get pulled into studio uh there's I don't know everyone knows there's like always reorg so we are just happen all the time and so like testing didn't used to be owned by like our team it was actually under a different director and then one reorg happens and now testings under my director and now my team works within that's like a live unit testing was able to happen and things like that so it was like always shuffling going around that change where product teams live and I think everyone agrees that you know the closer proximity wise you are to teams the more likely you can collaborate so absolutely Hey hold that thought for just one second while we take this moment for a very important message we've all come to expect that distributed databases can't be both globally consistent and scalable but what if you didn't have to make trade-offs what if you could have a fully managed database service that's consistent scales horizontally across data centers and speaks sequel introducing cloud spanner a mission-critical relational database service from Google cloud platform built from the ground up in battle-tested at Google for strong consistency and high availability at a global scale learn more about cloud spanner online at GCO get spanner that's GCO slash get spanner and we're back it's dotnet rocks Carl Franklin Richard Campbell and KCU and who's here we're talking productivity in Visual Studio I can't let a show like this go without saying how much I love code Lenz love oh yeah he's all-time and and that's one of those things that I look for it you know if I'm on a different machine I haven't turned that on or whatever and it it's not there I'm like oh man I use it all the time and what parts of it are you using the references they are the references the references right exactly so so I know when I have dead code I know when there's nothing referencing code and I kind of knew that in the back of my head but now it's absolutely clear ah that was something that I wrote before I don't need that anymore or I need to know you know how many things is are calling this guy it's just it's just right there click boom done love it yeah that's like everyone's favorite thing is that they're like Oh Colin's helps me identify dead code and a lot of people must even go further where we like fade out dead code it's actually one of our top feature requests that we're trying to get around to is doing the sort of dead code analysis yeah that's cool so all you really have to do is just make it sort of dark gray against black or you know light grey against white if it's if it's dead love it yeah the only problem is it like what we have to think about that say you're prototyping something and you quickly whip up a method but you haven't used it yet it'll be like feed it out but like you don't want it to be faded out sweets figure out how we can make a good user experience around the dead code analysis so that they're only getting that feedback when they actually want it yeah that's smart it's very cool and clever it's just interesting to think about code that way we used to do this all by hand yeah I know now we have tools that help make you so productive you think about other things like the logic of what you're writing rather than did I use the right you know syntax Visual Studio is seems like the you know the word the word for Windows of code development environments in other words there's so many features in there and it's so big and has so many things that like we were talking about discoverability before you know I bet your average developer doesn't hit 10% of what Visual Studio can do that's a guess yeah I'm like wanting to do this like I don't know how I would do it yet but like campaign where I try to get people to be power users of Visual Studio right I'm trying to figure out what are they using and then what do they need to use next to go to the next level so I need to see if there's some way I can like machine learn on the telemetry that I have sure I can do that whole if you're if you're using these capabilities here's the next capability you should use yeah like I should be able to like cluster users by commands and frequency somehow I don't figure something out so that's like one of my like pet projects that I'm trying to do on the side that would be cool and especially you know do you want Visual Studio to make you a better developer it's gonna watch what you do and make suggestions okay okay I guess turn that on sure yeah but we do have the opposite developer who is like so we have like the developer who uses that live feedback to figure out what they need to do next and what to fix but then we have the opposite kind of developer who seize that stuff it's like what a distraction you're taking me out of my element I know exactly what I need - right right just like give me this later when I want it on command or on demand later and so we have to figure out how we can help both these different types of developers and how we can you know cater that experience so we are looking into how it can make some sort of Zen mode esque thing especially as the world is getting more and more towards putting feedback more and more feedback inside the editor or it's gonna alienate that other type of developer so we have to figure out what the balance is there but you do have that choice - the sort of assemble your own do it your own way tool is visual studio code the you everything's in here we can take care of you you can do customizations if you want to is Visual Studio doesn't that balance itself of uh sorta like some people who are like galleries vs code I want to quickly prototype they use Visual Studio for the rest and those people were like I only use Visual Studio nothing else there's no use you know notepad or sublime to do prototyping but yeah like like guys are both like intellisense some people like need the intellisense that they're used to we actually have different intellisense between BS code and Visual Studio all right they're not exactly the same yes it's not exactly the same so some people that will throw them out of their element as well and so we just gotta think of what the right way is to make both these kind of developers happy so we are investigating some sort of Zen mode thing how are you surveying is it just user voice and i flatly admit I pulled up user voice before the show just to see what they talking about a visual studio and I'm like hi oh my goodness we still talk about open sourcing vb6 really yeah leave me like how am I getting the data that I have it is it is what is it how much is user voice or what's the tools that you're using to get feedback right so so we the Roslyn team which is team I'm on we have github so we have tons of issues come through github and actually more the more you up vote or like +1 the things on github like the easier it is for us to prioritize them but we also at the top of Visual Studio there's the little send feedback character with the speech bubble those things go directly to the visual studio teams so if you type something in there we're like oh I need this code style rule it goes directly to our team and we can see it and it's just frequency at that point like how many people have asked for this stuff like and then a lot of its just customer interviews so if I go to a conference people will reach out to me or I'll get their email from that and follow up with them and then they have teammates or they have friends or you know some people are on like will get from like marketing lists and then we reach out to them asking to fill out surveys I try to always put like do you want to followup with me and so I have email addresses from that and so then just have tons of conversations with developers about what they want and what they need do they surprise you from time to time you know I can imagine you hear the same stories over and over again but every once in a while you do you get a gem I imagine well currently we're starting to hear a lot of the same feedback over and over again but it's always like the first time you hear it is like whoa that was cool and then you because you really wow that was a good idea then every other person you talk to if they mention it like compounds they're like oh wow like we got to do this yeah sure push member up down is the one that I've been hearing a lot recently or it's like you can promote a field up the hierarchy chain or a down from the hierarchy chain as well as some which I never thought about that one but that one's nice and then a lot of people just catch things that we might have missed like we have add parameter to a constructor but we don't have it for a method it's just like oh like this is sometimes really nice things and so people help us you know of course correct for those things that's cool yeah well Richard yeah buddy guess what time it is now it must be that happy time again yeah it's time to introduce a new productivity feature refraction so as you know when your code breaks you get creative so if you're coding along and everything's working great you get that uneasy feeling you hit the reef raksha button and your code breaks again like it did before see what I did there that's a great feature I like that you know I don't really need a tool for doing that because that pretty much happens my code anyway yeah just press any random key pretty sure I just smack my head on the keyboard and I get those results it's actually time to give away a D experience subscription from our friends at DevExpress to one lucky member of the dotnet rocks fan club you know everyone knows that DevExpress has great desktop controls but their web tools are just amazing they have a collection of html5 JavaScript controls called dev Xtreme at the heart of this product line they're powerful controls like grid chart pivot grid tree list and scheduler but dev Xtreme also comes with more than 50 touch optimized client-side controls data visualizers navigators editors lists dialogues and notification controls and general-purpose controls like filter builders range sliders file uploaders scroll viewers and more and since they're all html5 JavaScript and CSS they include integrations with things like jQuery knockout react ionic and angular also dev Xtreme controls come with an spinette MVC and asp net core wrappers so it's ultimately flexible but don't take our word for it go for a test drive right now at DX dotnet rocks calm that's DX dot dot net rocks dot-com all right buddy who's our winner today's winner is borrowed boot Roger congratulations bar old golf you sir indeed umbral just won ad experience subscription a big pile awesome from our friends at DevExpress Jess for being a member of the dotnet rocks fan club if you want to join the fan club go to dotnet rocks comm click on the big get free stuff button answer a few questions and join the fan club we have thousands of members all over the world in every show we like to give away stuff from our sponsors in every December we give away a $5,000 technology shopping spree to one lucky member of the fan club but you got to sign up to win and we also like to ask our guests KC if you had $5,000 to spend on technology today what would you buy oh that's tough like any technology Jo or Mike doesn't have to be code give me any technology um any technology Wow the hard questions I'm super practical so I probably like another monitor that's like really boring whatever the new Kindle is that's gonna come out that's what I want they're always another Kindle that's for sure yeah I've actually finally kept a Kindle long enough that it's battery starting to weaken because normally I leave that leave it on an airplane or something and they're gone forever and that's it it's used to get anyone uh-huh but I think that's almost time to buy a new can I got one of the original paper whites which is a great Kindle but somehow I have managed to lose it I may ask you to have to replace it yeah yeah my backup Kindle is the og Kindle Keyboard people are than everything that's all whenever I break one of my and I'm like oh I gotta go back to the Kindle Keyboard yeah they do make some high-end ones now I'll tell you but you know that you're not gonna get through five thousand bucks buying a Kindle yeah maybe I would buy the surface dial also more fancier surface pen because I actually love the surface book because I also do like graphic design for fun of my free time writing on the screen with the surface book is so awesome like like I used to act like plug in a USB and with like little tablet and you would write on that tablet and see it up on a screen yeah Wacom tablet yeah which is that like having your brain have to think about writing down on a table but seeing the results up higher yeah it's not was always really hard and now it's like surface use draw directly on it just like it's paper and it's just yeah you just whip up stuff so much faster now yeah I'm gonna a daughter who's an artist who when I got her on the surface pro she actually used her Wacom less like just yeah it was that good just figure out this works yeah it's so good yeah oh maybe I would like buy myself a lifetime supply of Photoshop and illustrator there you go so expensive work what is it 60 bucks a month I think it's like 99 60 something like that 65 yeah Creative Cloud I convinced work to pay for it cuz I do a lot of mock-ups and somebody can't do a mock-up it's not in in Photoshop so got away with it that way because a lot of people just use PowerPoint I can't do that schools in that yes I like it well also I think if you're doing a mock-up if it looks like Visual Studio you can tell immediately if people have an allergic reaction so it's like oh I changed the sorting order of intellisense this is what it will look like now whereas if you just high like yeah really like you know ghetto boxes with Comic Sans text in the middle that's much harder to tell if that would you know if you're bothered by the look of the mock-up or the actual ordering of things do you think that mock-ups are actually more effective than even showing it in code per se like it's it's safer it upsets them less as opposed to that prototype that's opposed to a prototype exactly well mock-up is way cheaper than a prototype that's true and so when it's a it's esli better but it's cheaper so you can iterate on it faster and get initial ideas and then once you go from there then prototype is I wrote I'm all at the developer experience so I need to know as they're typing if it's gonna work so we're actually when we working on the like smarter intellisense that we're working on we're gonna do UX studies to see if people are able to type faster if what they want is in the top three and things like that Casey are there any online resources to help people become more productive a visual studio yeah a great question we actually so I spent all of December trying to document everything inside visual studio that has to do with productivity and then we actually have a Docs team now working that keep me in check to make sure I'm documenting everything so we have tons of documentation on Docs at Microsoft comm yeah and I've actually written a how to be productive in visual studio 2017 guide which you can go to it's like a kms /v s 2017 guide and that tells you what features may be off by default that you really want to use so you can turn on and just has like a list of all different navigation capabilities we have how to use editor config and things like that very good when I pulled up that that particular poster right away ended up on the unit test stuff and it reminded me of the whole that whole live unit testing although I think it's an enterprise only feature isn't it yes live unit testing is enterprise only but it's cool to literally have as you're typing code see your test start to pass oh yeah yeah it's the whole bringing feedback sooner as you're typing thing that we were talking about earlier that's a live unit testing does so typically if you're writing it you know doing unit testing you have to you know like you write a bunch of code like oh did this make my test fail or not right and so you figure out what tests are gonna run to check and if you run all your tests it usually takes too long so you kind of guess what is the smallest number that will run the fastest really the most confidence in then you click some button somewhere to run them and they have to navigate to a separate window to actually see the results of your unit tests and so live unit testing kind of gets rid of all of those manual steps from the equation by just as you type we use Roslyn to figure out what tests are or what yeah tests are impacted by your code change then we run those for you and then inline in the editor without you losing that context of your development we let you know if where you are failing or passing the tests it's really clever it's very it's you know right against that sort of code style approach and one of the styles is passes the tests passes the code tests that you want all of those that kinds of enforcement's going on mm-hmm just feel short it's sort out what Britt what's breaking and why we are use style cop years ago to do some of that stuff is it DC the code style configuration and the configuration editor thing just replacing that so style cop used to be sort of like a tool that you would run and now what's actually happened is the style cop I don't know if it's like their team specifically yours it's just like community people who have always used style cop have used rosin analyzers to write all the style cop rules as Rozlyn analyzers so as you're typing inside Visual Studio if you have those Nuka packages installed that come with those analyzers you will get all violations squiggled inside your editor that's cool very cool and so my team personally does not used to the style cop rules because they probably usings inside the namespace and things like that but if that's if your team uses style cop and you want that live enforcement there's definitely the community has made a style cop analyzers is what it's called rosin analyzer package that you can install on use yep found it on github and you certainly get it off a new get yeah yeah so yeah take advantage of Rosalind doing all this work for you mm-hmm no and people are just like built so many cool things using Rossum it's creamy yeah it's just one of those mind-blowing technologies that you you don't think about what you can do until you've used it and then you said oh wait a minute well we did the show with Mads T years ago at the beginning of Roslyn shipping and it was sort of this conversation about 2013 I just looked it up 2013 I said there's about to be a Cambrian explosion of of c-sharp because of this and here we are five years later and it's happening it's just the style cop now has got a analyzer so it operates in real time it's nutty yeah so what's next for you or what's next for studio because you you're pushing out these updates so often I I wonder if we even need to rev version numbers anymore you're asking questions way above my pay grade man they're gonna tell you how it's gonna go we could call the boss but it'll cost release in the next one is it no no that's very fair very fair I just baby idea is what we want to do we don't know when they'll come out or anything so can we can the community get involved on github or any other public discussion area where they can send their suggestions yes so in the productivity guide link that I shared with you all at the bottom it tells you how you can share feedback which is L&R github you can file issues or find issues on there and comment on them or use that send feedback icon at the top of visual studio and from there I believe it takes to Chu developer community it's called and you can vote things on there as well or people can just straight up email me if their sing switch my emails Kas BYU at Microsoft comm yeah I will take all your suggestions and make sure that we can compile them all and get stuff done Casey thanks for the work that you do and thanks for joining us today on dotnet rocks yeah thanks for having me you bet all right we'll see you next time on dotnet rock [Music] dotnet rocks is brought to you by Franklin's net and produced by prop

demands of each and every member of the string quartet and caters to their specific needs Colston offers a fine violin rosin rosin specially formulated for the violist Sneed's two grades of unsurpassed cello rosin x' a normal grade and slightly tacky or medium grade and a base rosin available in three different blends soft all weather and hard grades to accommodate all climatic conditions and plane needs in the early 1960s Samuel Cole Steen began a quest to solve the rosin problem that there really were only generic grades of rosin used for both violin viola and cello the bass too had little rosin choices at that time with the disappearance of weed off bass rosin the main base rosin that was relied upon at that time the existing horizons had problems of overly powdering and little longevity without drying out and the formulations were not customized to the needs of the individual player and their instrument samuel Colston with his extensive background in Lutheran and engineering dedicated several years of extensive research in development and created a line of resins that were not only specifically formulated to each string instrument and players needs but offered longevity of playing qualities low powdering and even adherence to the hair of the bow Colston's new rosin attracted the attention and loyalty of some of the finest players of that era after the passing of Samuel Cole Steen in 1999 his son Barry Col Steen took over the development process and refined the full line of Colston resins even more by slight improvements to the formula in addition the development of electronic automated heating and pouring pots immensely improved the quality and quality control of each and every production run of Colston rosin products the complex rosin machinery designed by Barry Cole steamed slowly heats the rosin components to exact temperature constantly monitored and controlled to ensure that the melting process does not heat or boil off any of the essential components in the Rossum formulation each and every pore is overseen by Barry who is directly involved in the final formulation of each batch of rosin the multiple components that go into each pore of Colston rosin are exactly measured with checks and balances to make sure that the quality is maintained on every piece of Colston rosin the melting pot has an agitator that consistently mixes the components through the entire melting process once again ensuring the best consistent quality once fully heated and blended the rosin mixture is then strained into a lower heated dispensing pot any impurities in the multiple tree resin components are removed in the final straining to make sure that the Colston rosin kegs are of the finest quality possible after the rosin is strained into the dispensing heating pot the pot is air sealed and pressurized to avoid any evaporation of vapors this is followed by the pouring process dispensing the melted Colston rosin components through our semi-automatic pouring equipment all temperature levels are strictly monitored the rosin is then dispensed into heat-resistant silicon molds that not only uniformly cooled molten rosin but also embosses the coal steam name and logo onto all the violin viola and cello rosin kegs the base rosin has unique silicon packaging wrapping it in a protective sheath that not only keeps the rosin sealed but also eliminates the warm weather melting that bassists previously experienced with the rosin pour completed the rosin is stored in the silicon molds for a curing period of several days before the rosin is removed it is then adhered to a decorative cloth with a protective plastic shield being capped over every keg of violin viola and cello rosin this prevents heat embossing of the cloth onto the perfectly formed rosin while in storage all Colston rosin products and all associated processes in the production of them are quality controlled to the highest level

damn [ __ ] insane doesn't it look insane it literally looks like i like the uh the banana macking door it looks like that same [ __ ] well that's outdoor and that's whole spectrum we can do that yeah let's do that awesome [ __ ] yeah yeah that is the best pipe right now i've been [ __ ] around with this tower with the thing on it and it is actually super intense this way so with the banger on it didn't work but this thing this way it works very well uh jim you have a pipe too yeah and you have two um wands huh sweet jim saves the day together we have a whole set i have two pipes uh and and one and one no no no it's good that you have the two because i'll break it or lose it and i do have two but i break something again yeah i did i stepped on it and broke up i threw it on the ground yeah i was already on the floor yeah thank god um all right so direct in contact with the coils onto the glass and so you do it with um does that work too with like the sticks too where you just put it you can we did remember we did it we did it yeah we did a temperature test on his on the sticks that he uh last time he was doing it on my switch jesus it broke you can't the thing to stay on damn broke in my backpack from being just in there tossing around yeah so you can hold the button on the back now you have to hold it there so this one doesn't have where it works all the time so i have to use a lighter yeah but i don't mind that still is completely functioning torch mode for me yeah mine's not probably functioning torch mode except for when your thumb's on i got this one from frankie because he didn't like having to use the lighter so i was thinking about the book too so what were we planning on covering maybe like what we cover in the class well so honestly i mean that's really up to you i was also thinking though for real there might like when we first started heli bank right in 2018 we just wanted to like see if i personally want to see if there's any literature out so i bought the only book that i found that was a rosin book and it isn't it was a piece of [ __ ] it was a stupid [ __ ] i think we talked about it so we focus on rosin a little bit more it just it like it talked about like kind of the idea of rosin before no one's really put no paper what raw like techniques of ross in and like information information for somebody to grab on how to make surprises and straight up no one has put up the whole process to how to make good rather than why they're bronzing is coming out black and white they were literally making like bro like brown rose and they're like yeah and that's a lot we can cover on that too exactly literally just on um on like product quality cured versus not here there's a book there but to go into everything that you teach in the newest class like the solvent that's why what i sent you was the trichome textbook the idea is just like how to really like you're going to make it into a whole like it's going to be a series that would be like a 100 book that's what i thought was a big fat book 60 to 100 or something like that it'd be fat somebody that really actually wants to do this is gonna invest 60 is like you know i feel like it wouldn't even that would not like give honor or whatever the [ __ ] to the amount of information we're gonna try and the time that we're gonna put into it but it'll make it accessible to people so that's the only reason i put yeah number there but i'm not like stuck on those numbers i'd be 100 willing to be like no we're saying 100 so only people that really [ __ ] want this information are going to buy it i guess that really will determine on how much we want to invest in it making it like well that's controller-wise picture-wise it's gonna have to be that's the thing yeah it's gonna have to be like the best [ __ ] be exactly depending on how much money we invest in it to do it um we'll really directly relate what we're gonna have to charge for it exactly and honestly though you know if we worked with the right kind of people there are definitely someone in publishing there's somebody in publishing that would be interested in this that could actually that has the right you know whatever the [ __ ] if we were to try to really make it really nice you know and stuff i don't know because also i'm not sure entirely the scale to which you you know you want to make this because i am very into trying to help people to make the best medicine they can you know and putting a book out i think it's the best idea i think that's a good idea i've been i thought about it for three days after that that's all i could think about in the background i think it's a really good idea for us i think for for the people for hash community like you said yeah there really isn't very much information out there for you to get told at all i've been trying i tried to buy books on it too when i started and it's there's really not anything out there it's good it gives you any good no one that's doing it has spent the time to explain to you their techniques really is the thing totally that's it no one's actually they're either doing it or they're not you know and so um no that's it for real and yeah i think it's a great idea i think what we could do is i mean i don't know what your plan was on it we would just split everything that we make on it in half oh totally yeah and then well i know you're always not worried about money because you're [ __ ] afraid oh don't worry about everything's great we'll just but we really should figure it out a little bit like so [Laughter] it knows me for real yeah i think it's really like everything's fine it'll be all great but no but for real though like i so we just split everything we make and what we do is i guess i'm pretty much what i'm expecting is i'm pretty much gonna have to finance anything that we do well no that's the thing honestly to be 100 with you i would actually just gear all of the production i put in like i've been putting a lot of money into the studio and uh my teeth for a while last year was paying for [ __ ] surgery and [ __ ] like that but i make a good decent bit i just like to project it towards something so like i've been putting my money towards my camera and stuff i'm saving for a better lens and [ __ ] like that so it's like that's thousands blah blah blah i'd rather seriously we're going to focus on the book that's why when i texted you i think i said something 2021 sounds to me like i'll focus a lot of energy on that yeah i think that's gonna be amazing because i think there's a lot of you there you're adding a lot of value to it on how much you'll you'll focus on it too straight up totally dude so um what we'll do is we'll just split everything um like what we would do what i was thinking is um 50 50 on on all our outgoing costs yeah and then 50 50 on whatever we make on it totally and then whatever we could especially if you have some funds on it we'll be able to split that up and be able to finance it i would imagine fairly you know um decent i don't know how much we don't need to spend a ton of money i don't think to make it but it would be definitely going to cost some money to be able to get it published and to be able to get it printed um and i think that um i mean we're probably not going to make very much money on it but maybe in the long run we will and uh i think it'll really give us not really the word credibility i would say because we don't really need i don't really need credibility right but in the sense that the emerald cup winning gave me credibility it will do that it'll solidify my our teaching of it i think in the sense that like uh people will want to learn from us more have more access to want to know to learn from us have the ability to find out information and pass our information on to other people and get our information just out there definitely all right cheers in the book cheers i have one question for frank after this one in regards to what you were saying with publishing and talk that tastes like fruit no it is fruit what was that one that was the secret orgasm happened wow fruit pollution yeah it's like those phenols that they did this year they killed three or four different oh yeah there was there was a lemon head and then there's there's limited seat four i think oh okay i'm confusing it all right there's eliminated 48 lemon head like seven so you're right yeah yeah okay two women had ziddles okay and then there was lemon head they used to otherwise elsewhere that's what i think you're remembering because i've seen that we did that too but that [ __ ] tastes better oh wow second that read actually it's ridiculous that's so that's the technique i'm gonna do i don't know about consistency but i've been really refining my washes and that's how it got cleaner i feel and i'm gonna this is what i'm gonna replicate for the cup and just sweet for the lemonade zittles c4 so just to break it down you took the fresh press and then it let it butter and then whipped it crushed it would play it you had bird tech yep yep i just pretty much did bird check to it i filled the jar up shut the jar and then um slowly let it let it just warm up and then you divide the grams after that yep after i day after it has to sit for a day because sometimes it'll like dry a layer or like look dry because you didn't remove all the oxygen out it's like almost impossible to sometimes some strains is that the bubbles in the fresh press uh i think a lot of that is that but it's it's also just when when you have hash cure it is gonna have holes in it from from the curing process god that shit's good yeah that is a [ __ ] very uh unique program [ __ ] good isn't it yeah is that what it is it's the lemon that i'm feeling oh that's so good i hope i replicated just like that for my tough entries because i think that is a good chance to win the motor breath is that's i'm going with whatever that's why is that the whole plant that you talked about harvesting no i haven't watched that yet oh jesus christ well that's exciting i haven't watched any of that yet yeah wow that makes sense yeah that must be ridiculous that's gonna be ridiculous yeah wow and i'm gonna watch all that and then i'm gonna watch the stuff that my wife made at our house i grew up in our house too she's like an ice cream cake by white mango oh [ __ ] oh wow that's crazy what the [ __ ] is that gonna be know i'll watch that that might be the fourth one i entered for the cup wow how it turns out i just haven't decided what my fourth entry will be mango cake wow that's awesome wouldn't that be cool and nice day for a white mango wedding nice day for a while my wedding yeah yeah that would be good that is amazing that is the white wedding yeah so so yeah that's what i have to do to that to get it to cure like that though because sometimes like even this one right here it's it's not as wet as it would be if i crushed it down one more time whoa so if you had done that with the whole i did the whole run you're saying like all the way together if you would continue one like sometimes like this lemonade settles if you just crush it down once it's like so derpy and so like its own weight kind of helped you do that process and it was like so so like uh um the um the viscosity of it was was was less of like thinner viscosity so that when you crush it it's helping you do that process it's where if you got like a thicker denser mask there's gonna be harder to actually crush it a hundred percent down and perfectly without still being voids and still sometimes hash kind of cures again like it just takes a second you know like you you think it's all done caring and and you crush it down and it'll look wet and then the next day you'll open the jar up and it will be dry looking because it's still needed a little bit more time too and like because like gravity kind of crushes it down on itself too you know so the viscosity of it i think is what plays a role because when the viscosity is thinner like this lemon head zibbles you just crush it once it'll be fine it'll stay wet the next day it's only when the scarcity is a thicker viscosity when you're pressing it or any you know what i mean like if you can grab your gloves and it's easy to grab your gloves that's like usually a thicker viscosity um like if it's if it's so thin like you try to grab with your gloves it'll like smear on your gloves so like that viscosity is going to lend you to easier crush it down and get that process you're trying to achieve to happen because what you're trying to do is just remove all the air it's doing that for you in a gravity sense in its sense of how it's laying its terps you know what i mean so like a denser one as it cures and the thc binds with itself in there it's gonna be like crystallized and the terps won't be like washing them off like kind of like interpreting making it really derpy so some some strains i have like that happen faster and some take longer and it's when it's terpier the viscosity is higher it takes longer because the thc account buying through it is easy it's like terpier and so you'll have to crush those down a couple times sometimes so you'll want to wait a couple of days if you see it at room temperature for two days sit like that terpe you know it's not going to change whoa okay you know what i mean but if you make a jar big ass jar like 20 grams or whatever i crush it all down and i see if i go and i come and open it the next in two days and it's it's dry then it wasn't done i gotta crush it down again and now if i was to put it all out and portion it all up then you wouldn't be able to redo that so you got to do it all right and have it where it i would say two days is a sufficient time sometimes you can do it within a day you could definitely tell within a day what it's going to kind of happen if it if it's going to be a dryer it'll have changed a little in a day if it's not going to stay freezer that was my question yeah freezer or yeah yeah i i so the freezer is going to slow your preserving when you put it in the freezer so you're going to slow this process down so it's going to take longer for you to be able to tell anything so like when i'm trying to find out if i'm trying to make something wet like a whipped consistency then i'm really i'm very i'm leaving it at room temperature for it to happen and that happens a lot faster than like a temple ball if you take it and age it in a refrigerator you're stopping the process of making the temple by preserving it inside so you don't want to do that to make a temple just like when you make wine you don't store wine in a refrigerator you store wine in a wine cellar and that's because wine is fermenting just like the temple ball is so you don't want your temple on the refrigerator nor would you want to put something refrigerator that you're trying to achieve a consistency if it is over a time process so if it's going to take you so that would take a longer time to do it and you could probably figure out on how to do it that way with time but you're gonna have to like probably wait a week or something before you can come back and get it to achieve the same thing it would achieve sitting out for a day just like making wine if you put in a fridge it might make wine but it's gonna take forever it's not going to make wine like it does it normally because it needs that that somewhat of a ability to not be in a frozen state or preserved state so that it can happen so like if i was trying to make fresh pressed i put it in a freezer directly after i press it now by doing that it locks it all in to stay clear longer at room temperature afterward but considerably longer if i don't take the fresh press and put in the freezer right away the thc can start binding and it will in the freezer it'll just take longer but it can still happen but if you don't let it ever bind and you froze it right away when it was still translucent like right after you pull it off the press it it froze those thc crystals in in state before they could find each other so it takes longer for them to find each other because it's this thick ass dense oily mask that you put it into now and it's all cooled down because it's in a freezer so it's going to take a long time for it to get to that side and body with itself on a molecular chemical level wow so yeah so you can like make fresh press last longer like if i want if i want to make it have a better shelf life that's what you have to do you have to put in a freezer and funny me and bloodsmith both found this out separately testing separately and both came to the same conclusion separately without talking to each other and then talk to each other about it afterward and both had tried this and found out that yes if you put your first freshly pressed fresh pressed in the freezer right away and then you portion it up that's the one of the reasons we found it i found it was because you can't portion fresh press very well and it doesn't look very good if it's not perfectly like in a jar nice coin in my mind so if you put in a freezer right away you can take it out of the freezer and break it into chunks and in a cold room even if it's really gooey [ __ ] you have a tiny bit like a minute that you can shatter all your trunks up get your grams weighed up and you can even like throw it right back in the freezer if you need two per second it's like really going to be strained and pull right back out and you'll have enough time to like squeeze it into a ball kind of then you can put it in your jar and what happened was i started doing that and i had leave left in the freezer overnight so i wasn't going to prepare it until the next day that's when i started finding it out and then putting two and two together and trying it to work noticing if i put my fresh press in the freezer right away for like at least a few hours to fully fully freeze if the whole hour dense puck however long it would take to fully freeze that maybe eight hours depending on how big of a chunk you did you know maybe 10 hours but fully freeze it then pull it out portion it up you could after you portion it up you could leave that jar at room temperature and it will take considerably longer for it to butter up than if you didn't do that if you didn't leave it for you if i never put in the freezer oh okay like or if i grab them all up like if i pressed the rosin and then grabbed all the rosin up and then like let's say finally got it into the freezer hours later that would still take that butter up way faster than if you put in the freezer right after pressing it because you freeze that state right away before the th that's like right when it's translucent that thc has not valid itself yet and that that's why it's not cured at all yet there's no whiteness to it so you need to freeze it in that state immediately then you can grab it up later after it's been fully froze and then you can pull it out and put it at room temperature and it would take way longer to to turn to fresh press or to turn to a cold cured than if you just press some rosin grabbed it up and put it out that stuff would turn to cold cure right away right away there's something about that it finds itself if you let it just be gooey warm and then cool down and then even put into a refrigerator it doesn't like freeze the state even if you grab it all up put in a refrigerator that's not going to achieve it you gotta press your oven put it in the freezer right away the way i do it is i put it on parchment paper and i fold the parchment paper into like a a pouch and then put in a ziplock bag a freezer a freezer bag and then freeze it right away and then i'll pull that out and break it into chunks and then that's how you can actually manage it to where it's it's a manageable piece like a ball and then push it into a jar like a perfect coin because you made a ball first and then you put the ball in the coin and you can push that ball out into and if your room's cold it doesn't really matter how gooey it is especially if it's like fully frozen you have a little bit of time to kind of get to manipulate it play with it so that's just one technique and trick i i have done that i can for sure say is significantly uh extends the shelf life of fresh frozen staying as fresh frozen versus it turning to a cold cure it'll give you a longer shelf life of it staying translucent it'll last longer as translucent like if i pull a jar in the fridge i mean it's no joke because i was wondering because the uh the lemonhead skittles that i just bought most or actually i'm sorry motorhead fresh pressed that stuff stayed fresh pressed out of the fridge for a long time it could be that it's cold in here but for a minute yeah that's one of the things that i've noticed is when you do that it'll it'll lengthen the time that you get it as fresh press well that's badass it's cool to be able to do that because people like having it as fresh press and it's really hard to give that to somebody because it create changes right away like if you don't try to do something to it right if you don't at least freeze it right away it won't stay like that i just now know that you've explained this too i just now have realized the difference in the rosins that i've been getting where they were either fresh frozen or cold cured so it was just now that i just realized those two different consistencies kind of well so like um then uh bud smith's thing he um his looks similar they're both buttered nicely but his was fresh pressed one is fresh frozen and one of them is is cold cure and that's actually where you kind of see this they're both fresh frozen fresh frozen they're both fresh pressed too though yeah buttsmith only does fresh i believe yeah right that's all yeah okay then when you say the cold cure it to it so but smith whenever you get something from him it's going to be frozen first like i just explained to you yeah because he's making it uh to sell out as or to be used as fresh pressed um now whenever you just take a jar fresh press it's eventually going to turn itself what you would like to call maybe cold cured because it is sat into a cold room after it had been fresh pressed so now would be called cold cured right wouldn't be considered whip because he doesn't remove the oxygen from it no one actually whips anything there's no actual whipping going on especially and [Laughter] we know he's not whipping anything but yeah so then it'll have a different texture and and i i feel like a cold cured fresh pressed gram is going to deteriorate and break down faster than if you would have crushed the oxygen out of it and allowed the terpenes to actually separate from the rosin in a sense of peanut butter doing that with the oil that's mixed into peanut butter and preserving it and allowing oxygen not to permeate through and actually break down the rosin so i don't agree or like or think anyone should promote cold cured i think cold cured in in my mind would be one step away from making it correct would be removing the oxygen from it so you're actually one step away from doing a really good job so if i explain if i understand this correctly the the bird tech is the crushing right and then the whipping it is literally it like literally they would almost they would look identical if people just look at them so your tech though actually preserves it and makes it last longer whereas this one is exposing the action doing the exact opposite what you're talking about exactly so intense so i do understand it yeah okay so that is so crazy and when you first explained that to me i was overwhelmed because all the whip stuff is what everybody posts online and it's called whipped and what you're doing looks like that but it's the more intellectual actual functional part yeah we're like breaking it down a little bit on what we want to achieve and what should be done to to make the process of it um lengthen shelf life and make it better and it's in its process and people are just trying to achieve a better color they're not trying to to think further ahead right that's the problem last longer it's just gonna be a color for the day okay they buy it it looks sweet right there had this like really cool consistency with these like filled it full of deteriorating pieces of oxygen you know very fragile yeah exactly exposed so like like think about it egg if you made like a really good like i don't know what it is like like it's like a souffle or something right when they're like the dude's like folding the [ __ ] the cream like the phone right he's like folding it in like what if you were just over there beating the [ __ ] out of his phone that he just made and you're like just whipping the [ __ ] out of it he would lose his [ __ ] mind right he'd come over and slap the [ __ ] out of you yeah you know hey he's like what the [ __ ] did you just [ __ ] do to that [ __ ] foam i just made you just thought you'd whip it like a slave master they just whip the [ __ ] out of it it's ridiculous i see videos of that [ __ ] you know who does it really bad as blue river turps oh really i see like he has those tall jars like those big tall ones they're like this big around yeah and the whole jar will be like you could tell you've been whipping because it'll be whipped [ __ ] all over the jar i don't have like this much in the bottom of the jar yeah that time they're [ __ ] just whipping the [ __ ] and it's white as [ __ ] [ __ ] let me tell you it looks [ __ ] gorgeous expected they turned it into butter though wow and so this shit's gonna break down rapidly and it's gonna taste like [ __ ] from the inside out i mean come on there's no way around it wow so that you have to you have to think about what's happening like also i mean we should i mean i have a really access to a really good microscope at the farm i should probably be doing some more um studying and figuring out things with the microscope because a lot of this i'm telling everybody is like i don't have a picture to show anybody but like i could show you the super i'll show you a cold here what cold pure fresh press looks like under a microscope would look [ __ ] ridiculous yeah no you could see all those crevices i'm talking about so that would look like a cornbread on the inside not a cream as a as an example of these two are these the whipped and you're whipped and you're a fresh press are these the example of the fresh press held in its true fresh press position with that and then the whipping being the cold cured one yeah so you know what the next episode is reviewing the two of those yeah yeah one for the yeah exactly that's what exactly it is that's what it is it's my version i call whipped i tried to change the name while back um to um crushed cold cured or cold care crush or something nobody liked it and and nobody understood it i started explaining it to people over and over and then i could see like when i was explaining to them i was going right over their heads it was like too much information dude i'm gonna look into it because there's definitely some something in the food industry that is doing that to get the oxygen out of something like pressing it with it love though with not pressing it you know there's something i want to figure out this makes total sense yeah like he said fold it when you let's see instead there's a there's a technique when you when you've made um foam when if chefs made foam and when you introduce that to like a a pie or something you want to make or you want to make a meringue pie look at making meringue pies it's exactly that make the meringue the meringue is like really airy full with air that part of it you don't is not directly related because they have to introduce the air to make the meringue like that but once you've made the meringue you don't just you have to fold that in so gently to the rest of the ingredients to blend it in correctly it's very gentle and and but if you don't do it correctly you'll just have big ass pockets of foam and it won't be blended with the whole thing when you make a cake like a meringue i mean yeah i mean wow that's interesting and so it it's similar to that but like um i i think really breaks down to is just visually the ox the the cavities that have surface area available to the available surface area to be broken down is what we need to break down that's what we're trying to achieve is the only less surface area that's available for oxygen to break down the rosin just like why we why we don't want bubble hatching in a bubble hatch form too much surface area exposed to the trichome we want to crush it yes so that now the surface area is very minimalized like it's the same thing you know like you're still needing to do that once you've made the rosin so you think you have done it and you're done well you're not if there's a bunch of surface area that can be very interesting in there you need to still now further refine that down to be removing the oxygen in it that's why i call it crushing it because realistically that's kind of what you're doing is crushing it and i crushed it into the corner of the jar now we should talk to nicotia about it more at this class too because i heard him in his live video the other day explaining whipped then he explains it the same exact way it was really funny about how you crush it into the jar he said it's the same way as you explain it yeah yeah okay so that's crazy yeah and we don't really work together nothing you know what you mean yeah for sure yeah and it's like he totally explained it that way you're not whipping it he said you're actually crushing it down in the corner of the jar he said so it's definitely that's hilarious well recognized something we're figuring this out and he's a very smart guy he's probably figured out more on a technical level too what i'd like to hear what he has just well just like yourself i mean damn dude that was interesting as [ __ ] on the technical level just now so that's exactly how i like i'd like to hear what he is his take is on it too because it would be really weird like if he came up with the same hypotheses as me doing this in a totally different state far from each other not really using information from each other like in the case like if scientists were developing something in two different areas we we're not using each other's information to take our studies with his information you know making it to where mine's not you know so it is it is really crazy and weird to hear him say it like that right away too and so that's what i think is happening is it's just no one's realizing we need to further finish the process because you think you've made rosin you think you've done that and you have you have right then but if later on it it still cures up and it's dry looking then you've needed to do it again you need to remove that oxygen you know what i'm saying so would you recommend doing that once every some amount of time then i would recommend doing it one time right in the beginning letting it sit for maybe 12 hours or 24 hours and checking on it and if it starts to dry up then i would do it again if it doesn't you don't need to do it again that'd be possibly introducing oxygen into it that you didn't because you did it correctly and the process worked out with the way the terpenes are maybe like i talked about more viscosity the viscosity is a lower viscosity so it's like more more more of a thin so that it can crush down on itself easier already so like if if it's done you don't need to do it again it's done if it stays wet with that terp layer on top then you've achieved it it's not going to do that if there's surface area for those terpenes to go lay in like if there's cavities or crevices inside that rosin now if it has cured up more not necessarily dried but look dried out because the thc has bound with itself and then caused a little cavity inside there now once it bow itself because crystallize is kind of when it binds it's going to have little gravities cavities underneath it and then terpenes are going to go find it and lay in it and then you can't see them now they're inside the rosin in those little tiny holes they're puddles made all throughout under a microscopic level so you need to go back down in there and remove all those tunnels those holes all those things that were where the crystallized like because crystals aren't square or circle or anything nice so when they lay on each other there's gonna be spots all over the place where it can be a big hole wow i was just starting to get like really into figuring out about hash but i feel like it's on a more molecular level with rosin yeah that is crazy that's awesome this i think this is the story the science behind why everything is not shelf stable in this world why it's you know that's one of the freezer if you care about one of the things that you got me it got me into thinking about these different processes is trying to extend shelf life yeah boom exactly you open my mind to that whole aspect of it and why i think that you know things are the way that they are it adds so much price i feel like to them and all that stuff because it has to be in a cold truck the whole time and all this [ __ ] so and the end consumer it's like most people just they don't even know what's up not only has it been a cold truck it has to be a cold truck it has to be sent at just the right angle it can't be on its side or upside down so when it's like packaged it has to be packaged in the truck on a different level i keep i've done any weed or any other product that these guys have touched wow because they could just throw pounds of weed in their truck like these guys have to like put it in a box that's like strapped down or something or like secured correctly you know like in a bigger box that closes or something you can't just have them flying around in the back of your truck um totally it's like way more steps to this thing like you said of course the value's gonna go up yeah because there's so many more hands having to be involved and it takes a more intelligent person that's not just more intelligent a more educated on this aspect person to be able to yeah to be able to manage all the steps of it to get to the store so you have to have somebody that wants more money because he spent the time to to know how to talk to to to touch these things you know to to like to to to to take them from one star to the next like you said you have to have a refrigerated truck you have to have a [ __ ] you can't have them upside down you can't be [ __ ] you can't be crushing in the box that they're in or the you know i mean you can't be [ __ ] them up like there's a lot more to it you you can't you got to be more delicate and there's more steps to the process and since there's more steps to the process it always adds more money straight up just like when you make a tiffany bracelet it costs a lot more money and it's only a silver bracelet it's not even that much like i bought my wife a tiffany bracelet one time and it really opened my eyes though because you're like what the [ __ ] did they charge someone [ __ ] money for this thing for silver it's just silver solid silver but it's like 600 for a bracelet right just silver links you start looking at the links though and like touching them because you spent 600 on it so you're really going to [ __ ] look at it you're like what the [ __ ] wow sure does feel nice like you can't find a link like a cut into like oh like wow they put them all together now they're like perfect perfect like you can't find where it was split you can't find an imperfection in each link every [ __ ] one of them and they like is polished to perfection and it feels like different than you've ever felt and it's like okay i'm starting to see why this thing costs so much money now like wow someone spent a lot of time on this yeah someone went through a lot of trouble to make sure i couldn't see one line where it was split not one not even just a line you can't see where they grounded down and made it it's perfectly the same size all the way around somebody had to you know how hard that would be to do right that's why they have their name and that's what i appreciate you know it's like that's why you have to appreciate time and and someone's art that's when someone does that and they put their heart into something like that someone's but the machine made that thing perfect like that and they put their heart in that thing and then you go okay i want how much time did you [ __ ] spend on this john yeah we're charging 700 bucks for these and everybody's like sure i'll take one straight up not going to get anywhere else oh i just bought my wife a tiffany uh necklace for christmas that's what her present is she doesn't know but that's awesome it's pearls and silver and like nice dude you know when it comes from tiffany's i didn't even get to see it but like like we talked about i know the quality is gonna be on another level i can see in the pictures that it looks like it is but i know that's how it works when there's somebody like tiffany's and that's what i always try to strive to be is something like that where you just know it's going to be that quality you don't have to even you could see it but you don't have to you're not going to question it no without a doubt yeah you know it's going to come like oh okay i see why you charged me so much for that i just used them as an example the other day i feel like i just used tiffany's as an example yeah it is it's a good one i use it even like i take i took pictures of tiffany's in the box of tiffany's to my my designer i'm like dude check me look at this [ __ ] these [ __ ] get a lot of money for this box you know it's like special box right mm-hmm dude for real no it's because you're not a chick yeah so like for real i didn't either okay yeah so tiffany's box is special it's this special color that their boxes are it's like this bluish teal and it's a standard box that you would think of and it has a lid on it and then above it's like white and it it's like just their their their brand thing you know like tiffany's box let's pull it up he's pulling it up right now oh this is office yeah you gotta see it this is something i wanted i took it to them and i'm like dude we gotta copy this [ __ ] too they're on it they know what they're doing see it's like this special looking box like so if you see that box you don't even nee you just know you got a tiffany something from tiffany's the color and the the shape and the bow mm-hmm it's all this like like they have different sizes so they have something whatever it is it's all there yeah they have like they even have vases bosses and [ __ ] you know i mean like they have all sorts of [ __ ] yeah oh yeah there's all the information on it and stuff yes and then you like open it up there's another box inside of it there's like another one inside of it wow yeah see wow yeah so you you you go and you can tell though like when you get it like my wife draws the box in our safe yeah like that's that's that's where i started to steal my ideas from is what companies like that because that's how everybody works i mean come on and they all were all they spent a lot of money on that show no no joke 710 labs have the nicest [ __ ] boxes yeah they're the nice and they're the one and the other one of the boxes i always take to the to my designer too i'm like i want one like this magnus yeah totally i love that like i was that's one of the ones we're gonna do next is a a thicker cardboard box like theirs is where it's like and it's a clam shell like a wedding ring they magnetize it's very similar to theirs because they're not they know what the [ __ ] they're doing yeah no totally this is the center wood yeah i mean they did the research because i've done it too and i've looked and i couldn't find anything better still to this day if i put my logo on one of those boxes you know it would look like it would be [ __ ] good amazing yeah so i'm gonna do that for like some special special a box or something i'm thinking like you know like a limited edition temple yeah yeah cool probably like different one of them different strains mm-hmm 20 strains of stuff yeah no kidding yeah i got like kiwi oh you have old oh okay like the the flavors that otherwise would never be made into temple balls oh my god that's extremely exciting yeah like a whole bunch because like i've been getting more and and uh that guy that was here the other day um nick nicholas black yes okay yeah was uh he's like wanting some more loved it dude he loved it loved and he was like dude because he he needs medicine like real medicine like he'd been in bed body pain been bedridden for like a year and that's why he had to quit his job and [ __ ] like so he he was like blown away he's like dude this stuff's different he's like this is like [ __ ] medicine bro stretch what he said he's like i never i i did yard work all day it's like i'm about to do that in a long time he's like i put in eight hours and i'm like sore but like normal sore not like dead sore like he's like did i [ __ ] feel i can get my life back that's honestly amazing yeah it's [ __ ] amazing it's amazing to hear that so it's like and and like i was been thinking that i feel like uh there um i need to treat it more like a currency kind of like me putting gold in the safe because if i make a bunch of temple balls it's just money no straight up i mean and man those are that's the coolest expression the people that appreciate it yeah [ __ ] love it so that's awesome bro and you're starting to get more people that are actually appreciating it straight like i kind of went away from it and i have plenty for just me mm-hmm if i'm just smoking yet yeah yeah but if people are going to be appreciating them more like they are and i i do feel like i told you before i feel like temple balls are going to come back i think it's going to take i think it's this quality maybe maybe six years i feel like maybe less because i feel like the society progresses in a um what they think is cool totally you know totally good right totally so so um and so like then once they start doing that then they'll do research on it once they feel like it's cool because then they'll figure it out straight up but like like dog food like people fired out it figured out it's cool to feed your dog good dog food so they all started researching dog food and now nobody buys kibbles and bits for their dogs anymore dude no straight up when you said that to me it clicked and it made sense that like we are definitely fighting the same war because i had been saying this [ __ ] about food about just like literally go back to long island where i'm from i left there and you could not find any quality organic food as a food desert no local food nothing like that i go back there and there's like quite a good decent bit of health food stores and i'm like oh okay it's starting there even in a food desert you know where food is getting imported there yeah it is very coming here it's really it's actually coming quickly yeah i think like even in the last two years from when you would like have to go find somewhere to eat if you were a vegetarian you were harvard i'm having a hard time i am into exactly now you have a lot more options literally and like tenfold exactly and so i feel like that is is is the exact same way the weeds gonna trend is becoming cool now weeds becoming people are finding out it's medicine people are finding out okay then they're gonna go okay well we've been smoking bho yeah exactly they're gonna be like wait what all it's gonna take is once you start figuring out that you're shining arms you're not smoking you're not you you don't want to feed your dog kibbles and bits anymore the second you feed that found out you were feeding your dog your body kibbles and bits you're gonna go whoa see man would you like to collaborate with me on my book because for real i've been working on this project and i feel like you you have the same passion for it and you can help me to write it it is the cannabis conspiracy and that's why they've been oppressing it the whole time because once you [ __ ] really learn about cannabis and love it and see that the people that are growing it are [ __ ] working hard they're not lazy that is a [ __ ] mind control thing you know once you really get in comp into the lifestyle and stuff you realize that it you know i can grow this i grow my own food i'm gonna consume everything that i'm doing that and put it out into the world you know just the best that i possibly can i think that's the kind of what's going i think that's true i mean i think that everybody just does it what and then once you find out and you think it's cool then you do your research on it and you go oh [ __ ] it's not cool to feel my dog pills in bed which one is the cool one to feed my dog you know no seriously though especially with a dog is a good example because i always say about weed like um people young kids 20 year olds they're not they're not like yo vegetables i'm going to learn how to go grow vegetables but straight up with weed the 20 year old kids are excited about it the food that is the thing dog food is something that is going to get people to care about their health or that people think about more than they care about their own health because they want their animals for 40 years 10 years exactly exactly i'm willing i thought i was feeding my dog the best dog food because i was looking for like the best most expensive ones straight up and i thought that was the best one i didn't do my research i would look at the bags the bags would trick me it would like be cool like i would give a pro plan because they sold it the dog the vet my vet would tell me to sell it because they get money on a cut on all the bags of [ __ ] dog food i wasn't thinking about any of that i just thought i was dude go upstairs walk out of the room walk out of the [ __ ] room guy jesus christ i was just thinking that it's the you know what i mean is it's just definitely was the best that i was supposed to do that was telling me to feed my dog this food and straight up any research on it and then my wife was the one that told me to get it and then once you do was you like oh [ __ ] i thought i was feeding my dog the best literally shay has the exact same story yeah i had no idea i was [ __ ] killing my dog and then i was lining your pockets just right in the world it's like bho is similar to that in the cannabis ministry you go to these places and they're pushing it because they're making the most money on it at this different tree they're making the most money on the bho product so that's what they're pushing and then the people that are coming in that are uneducated or just buying what they think is the best [ __ ] and some of these companies are putting good bows and ribbons on it and then making it look really cool and really cool names of different things to trick you they're stealing the same names too live resin and then they're they're now doing like they'll put like numbers on there to trick you like you know how you'll see 70 to 120 and uh for like a u for like rosin yes yeah yeah no bho will actually put things like 70 to 120 and if you look really close it'll say hours in an oven back up no dude oh my god that is nuts just 120 they'll say 120. and you're like oh look it's 120 of you that says 128 hours in an at a vac oven dude that is [ __ ] cool so they're not just playing gimmicks with people that don't know what they're doing so it's not i don't think it's going to take six years it's what started me on this you know i don't think it's gonna take very long at all because people are picking up on it trending it's very trendy and once people picking up on a trend they're gonna just google it mass consciousness it doesn't take very hard for you to figure this out so fast nowadays [ __ ] google cannabis and google what your box that you're smoking just start googling that [ __ ] the bh what is it made of let me google that that's it you'd be done just like we did with dog food what is on the dog foods bag we start reading it and going son of a [ __ ] look what's on the ingredients list for our dogs food look at your [ __ ] hash box that would be the same thing blow your [ __ ] mind on the bho [ __ ] that's on there and that's not even all the [ __ ] that they're telling you that they're dealing with just like just dog food [ __ ] so like of course if you could break it down to like they did with dog food they took all the ingredients out that are fun just limited the ingredients down to barely anything just like making hash you make it from the barely any ingredients ice water heat pressure that's like all that's involved so of course when you make it out of the most basic things you know it's going to be better that's how everybody's finding out too i lasted the test of time thousands of years making instead of [ __ ] you know that's why it won't be very long people finding out no i know people still to this day that i'll be like um you know what bh people don't know what bho is they don't even know that bho is made with butane my father didn't know this not very long ago that he had no idea that to make stuff that he would smoke live resin that it was made with one of the [ __ ] these yeah exactly he had no idea it was literally not even figuratively like literally with this tip they put it over a tube that they blast this over the cannabis and then once it rinses over all of it it just drips out the bottom this liquid drips right right right that is what then they try to get this liquid out of it and then you smoke it yeah no totally it's the most no clue the most insane concept that is really how he was smoking because he didn't know he had no idea he'd seen it and it looked cool like diamond shapes and it's kind of translucent color it's pretty bho looks pretty for the most part yeah i mean until the raw you become educated but when you first see it and you see it and you think of concentrate you're like oh cool stoked on the gimmick of getting concentrated cannabis you know exactly and you see it you think it's an amazing idea and then you start smoking it and it looks like cigarettes too you smoke bho you don't realize it's [ __ ] you up like when you smoke cigarettes you could smoke packed cigarettes all day long if you smoke cigarettes you're fine with that right if i smoked a cigarette i would die yeah it would just ruin my throat totally but if somebody smoked cigarettes they could smoke a whole pack a day it doesn't [ __ ] their throat up doesn't mean it's not [ __ ] your throat up yeah exactly [Laughter] [Applause] that's not what's happening it's not that you're getting hurt more than me i mean i'm going to hurt more than you because i'm physically showing signs of it it's you have done now tainted your palate so much that you don't even know the bho is [ __ ] you up and the reason it [ __ ] me up is because i haven't smoked bho and if i do smoke a tiny bit of it i will pick up that and it'll actually [ __ ] me up like if i smoked a tiny bit of tobacco it would [ __ ] me up if there was a tiny bit of tobacco on my bong rip it would [ __ ] me up but i could smoke bomb roots all day long because i've used it like what's the opposite it works the same way too if a guy just smoked tobacco all day he tried to do a bomber he's done you you bet you you have to be used to it and if you're not he's gonna [ __ ] you up and that's what's deceiving too because people are like vho doesn't [ __ ] me up well it doesn't because you smoke it all day because you're used to it just like cigarettes don't [ __ ] people up that smoke cigarettes all day long yeah your throat doesn't hurt when you smoke vho all day long you're [ __ ] yourself up you just don't realize it because you like [ __ ] that thing up like telling you yeah that's what i was trying to say exactly um what's called the bio um [ __ ] but yeah you know your body telling you something yeah it's like you [ __ ] that up you don't even got that one to tell you it's like you [ __ ] that thing up the good [ __ ] angel has left you're dealing with the devil now that's it so it's like what it is it seems like two so you yeah you just have to be educated on it and then exactly bottom line yeah it is it's the bottom line because like i say also about food i still eat taco bell i still eat jack-in-the-box i'm not as good as you but i don't do it every day well that's the bottom line too exactly i've always said that one of the reasons i'm so hard on my diet is so that i don't i can if i have to eat whatever the [ __ ] i you know right in the apocalypse i'm gonna eat whatever the [ __ ] and my body's ready for it yeah that too that is part of the thing too i feel like as long as you eat it once in a while that's all yeah you just can't you just can't eat it every day exactly you just can't eat mcdonald's like you saw that movie right or that yeah yeah super size me yeah so exactly you can't do that you can't that's why i tell people about bho you can't super solve it with me you can't do that right make a documentary too now make make somebody just smoke solvent all week no dude that would be so they're a look they're like a full look one of the kids that that'll fight for it to the death though i'll just be like okay cool cool man you're going hard on the bhs we'll make your diet happen this week but we're gonna we're gonna switch over next month it's a 60-day film instead of the third year by the end he's like a fully educated like a lawyer [Music] yeah that [ __ ] it's just like it's just knowledgeable just like damn food just like we did with our organic food a guy we talked to you about millions of times you when you went to the grocery store ten years ago how big was the organic food section it was [ __ ] non-existent it was just a section like you said yeah non-existent in some stores even like in the in the poor areas where i'm from in san diego totally didn't even exist because you weren't going to afford it it was a waste of a space in my store totally like no one had that so it was like stupid we couldn't even witness we were lucky to get a [ __ ] apple you weren't going to be buying those expensive apples right yeah i didn't even know [ __ ] roma tomatoes existed like i was like oh my god there's different totally different heirloom tomatoes and [ __ ] i'm like oh my god what the [ __ ] is this but yeah nowadays just they're [ __ ] not even just a section it's like just mingled throughout the whole store now at this point the organic food has gotten so big they don't even have an organic food section number one straight up no i agree with you it's like just mingled in with everything now straight up it's like you got your organic [ __ ] sour cream next to your sour cream now yeah yeah and it's like that's just how you do it now two shoppers it's not gonna be no no like tiny little section like when we're kids it didn't even [ __ ] exist some of it is just marketing and branding too though because some of this [ __ ] was already organic like some of these places were doing this [ __ ] and i didn't even like market it organic they're like we should promote that we do all organic [ __ ] here no that's hilarious straight up exactly that's the whole point it became you know literally it's it's something that um as i've said about solventlessness and hash in general it's like it's bigger than the people doing it it's a big big thing that's a wave we can't stop it no one can [ __ ] stop it get the [ __ ] behind it or be in the [ __ ] motion that it is on and be part of your [ __ ] move you know i've seen it once once i started having people's moms mom their grandmothers wanting to smoke that's when i started seeing this [ __ ] change though because that's when you're like whoa [ __ ] like grandma is intrigued on this [ __ ] now for her [ __ ] glaucoma right for real and then like finding out like [ __ ] i'm willing because grandma's willing to do whatever at this point because she's trying [ __ ] hydro hydro hydrocut whatever the [ __ ] some crazy pill you know what i mean they put her on i'm sure you know that she gave her crazy side effects at this point she's like what do you mean some some weed that sounds sounds about like the best idea i've heard yet you know what i'm getting straight up straight up let's read what the doctors are giving you in the hospital yeah no not good for real you don't want to know how any of that shit's made that shit's horrible for you and that's like your only option or some pain medicine that's like horrible for you yeah no for real so so right like you said it's a wave is way bigger than all of us and it's coming just because it is many ways hips [ __ ] good for [ __ ] everything and and cannabis is good for everything and it brings people to something that takes like passion and love to two that brings out things and i think everybody too is something like to make the best cannabis it takes someone with passion and love not just some joe show mo [ __ ] [ __ ] that wants a bunch of money that's true though he won't that's friends it doesn't matter yeah chad brad do you see that what she did oh my god she went off bro oh [ __ ] oh my god i was blown away damn i wish i watched that one yeah she's on her page oh today okay it was on she said that all the chads and brads and she went all through because it's like yeah i don't matter how much money you have you'll find out real quickly you still need that guy that takes or a girl that takes pride and passion to grow that plan period bottom line it won't won't happen joe [ __ ] [ __ ] with all the money in the [ __ ] world will find out really [ __ ] quick [ __ ] like they just even did in working with some of them they [ __ ] went big with that and some of them fell on their [ __ ] face because that [ __ ] wasn't as easy as they thought um it's all molded well they started fine some of it they start finding out if they brought it on the stock that it brings up the cbd and drops the thc so you can guarantee a temp wow i remember frenchie saying if you do that never i would never work with you yeah that thing we were at yeah like if you write your plans on the stock people do that a lot like that was a big thing going on in oregon this year in washington where they rotted it on the stock because it brought up the cbd levels and dropped the thc levels so some people were actually doing strains they were ta they were actually cannabis strains because they had too much thc and they were good yielders and they produced really well and they had a good cbd in them and they knew they were just going to rob it so they can get rid of the cbd or the thc in it they did it all intentionally some of them from the beginning right like they started a straight they knew they were going to how are they going to make use of rot just extracts no no um cbd yeah what are you gonna do with that though yeah you totally just turn blast it yeah just like to blast it i guess to make tinctures and [ __ ] yeah yes you just blast into whatever you want not just teachers you can make anything you want yeah whatever you're making whatever you want you just go right to extract if it's just whatever you want food anything you want yeah yeah i'm saying because some actually some were actually selling um him but there was some guys that were trying to really sell like nugs of him i saw when i went to oregon too and there was like it was like high quality hemp like it wasn't bud rot though no no but this guy had small small amounts these guys were rotting it were like that's hundred thousand acres yeah right to extract people grow that for direct extract and they would just provide a few members and then they just grind it up into just a few they grind it up into biomass yeah exactly whole plant fresh piles fresh biomass yeah exactly yeah so yeah it definitely is what it is that's why he takes takes a little bit of um just education because all these companies are just gonna bring in somebody they're just gonna bring in somebody that smarter than me on all this [ __ ] and then just pay them to figure it out because that's the only way you can do it they have to do it you have to bring in somebody that knows what the [ __ ] he's doing and then you can still are going to need a whole team of people that are going to have love and passion for this planner else you're going to produce garbage and that's what that's the separation i think similar to budweiser you're always gonna have a bow wiser you're always gonna have somebody that walks past all the really good beers and decides no i don't want any of those really good [Laughter] at each beers four hours driving up to humboldt me and him screaming each other because he's like people still buy mcdonald's yeah he's like you know why made a very good point we're gonna make mcdonald's because they still buy it and their money is still good he made a very good point they're not really trying to stop us from what we're doing but we are trying to stop them from what they're what they're [ __ ] doing so it does make it a little bit of an uphill battlefield for us like you know the mcdonald's people first yeah you know but it's like you know it's a battle that the consumer in the end it's in the hands and the eyes yeah you're you're never going to stop that guy that goes so past all the good beer [ __ ] bubble eyes you're never going to stop him and to to think you are is crazy you're never going to stop somebody from feeding their dog kibbles and bits yeah exactly yeah we're gonna stop that's a sad battle and you're never gonna stop somebody there's gonna be somebody that's gonna still do that even though you tell them all the education on it even though you show them the proper one and and they find out they get it for really close to the same price or or even the same price just not even going to be the deterrent they're going to be like but my dog likes the red and the green ones totally boom yeah i mean 100 and then how are you going to argue with that yeah and then that's that you're like damn it it's like i had to argue the other day with a guy for like hours she's on on messages uh and he was like telling telling me that he knew how to make a better uh fire rosin than my hash awesome and he said this is the troll right dude no you're dead serious and he's like the reason that i don't think that flower ross is as good as hash rosette is because i don't know how to fresh flowers i'm good like he does he's saying that about that what about your opinion or show you i didn't have nothing to do with that because i saw the means that i wanted to talk to the guy and i wanted to tell him like hey from a decent perspective like i know these guys are clowning you because you're a [ __ ] idiot pretty much but i didn't want to go on your page i told him i dm'd him and said hey i didn't want to go on your comments and [ __ ] be a dick i wanted to to give you a chance to explain yourself before i took that comic wrong because what he said was his flower rosin is the same as ash rosin yeah and then it was like okay dude so like everybody starts ruining him yeah like bashing him so bad dude like he was like even complaining to me saying that his followers don't want to follow him anymore because they were all bashing him so much and it was all over the instagram thing that sucks jesus your instagram notoriety your book is [Music] like you wouldn't believe this [ __ ] he was like crying to me about it too and then but he's still telling me this stupid-ass [ __ ] like that i'm like dude okay he's like telling me well how come my rosin comes out perfectly clear there's no fats there's no plants there's no plant matter in it nothing it's just the same when you tell me under a botany's perspective of what's the difference in this i we both liquefy trichomes there's no different honestly my response would be like dude you would literally you would need to grow a flower that was 99 i tried hey i tried telling you i said why so much lower in thc yeah how come that you tell me that that's what science though that's what i said i think of science first of all i said first of all i'm not a botanist nor do i think you are right so explaining botany terms to someone that's not a botanist is ridiculous right yeah so let's let's not go there i said that's why i was like just tell me what tell me about it like what's going on can you grow 99 percent trichos dude you should just be like all hash on a planet he went dude he went on and told me like that's a really good definition i was like dude i'm not trying to be a dick this is this is the comments that i had in him oh yeah long conversation that's exciting so finally i ended up telling him look because i said look he's like my rosin just looks just the same as hash rather than i said a picture i said i don't think your rosin looks like that yeah dude i said so obviously something's in your rosin cause he's here's his oh i mean honestly it looks like a really nice flower rossignol oh that's what i told him the very first thing i said was curious nice flower russian yeah like the insane oh yeah that's actually beautiful yeah that's why he said there's there he was like going off about how i wonder if he even still has it up yeah but i bet the fresh press doesn't look as clear as that fresh press that's all i can say yeah but it is beautiful though no he has gorgeous work yeah for sure when they say flowers and hashtags on a different do you know what you're talking about or yeah he's just being a dick about it because he's like butthurt because right because he got bashed on he doesn't want to do the hashmaking process that's why right so i'll hit him up for an interview i'm gonna be like bro please i'll pay you for an interview not only that he would do one probably last week because he was like really dude like we talked for a long time you want to see if he'll come on right now while you're here while you're here because we're going to talk about you trying to tell me nobody nobody makes flowers and it's any good that's on the market yes yes i know that might be valid too have you heard of honeybiter i said oh true very true but honestly though nobody makes draws and like you like that [ __ ] like you're willing to do and stuff like that nobody makes it on the market either so i'm just trying to be devil's advocate but but his is beautiful yeah he's like yeah yeah this problem is great news he said no you're right though honey butter too yeah but the problem was like i told him you just can't you can't compare the two because they're not in the same category i said first of all you need to go do your own experiments do your own side-by-sides that's what i told him do a side-by-side experiment yourself and and do flower raws and pressing and that same stuff makes some hash out of it rosin and then smoke them next to each other let's see and you tell me because i ended up just telling him after he told me that i don't make as good of ha flower rosin as him is why i don't think flower rosin as good as hot rosin and i said you don't know how to make hash rosin is why you think flower ross isn't as good as half possible yeah that's the thing because if you knew how to make good ash browsing it would be a joke when you put it next to good flower awesome straight up and like if you can make that out of flower rosin just imagine sir you could probably make fire and then he tried to tell me it cost too much money to utilize the equipment to make hashtags and i said you're they're completely wrong and 100 machine you can do it with just water or you can do it with a [ __ ] paddle yeah no that's right exactly you don't even need anything but instead of that straight up we'll get a set of bags that are like 60 dollars with the wood you can cut the wood that's like 60 dollars for bags you can get all the bags boom yes cheap ones and they work great you don't make good stuff 100 they're i'm not going to say to put the best material in them but they're the best [ __ ] if you ain't got nothing to use and you're trying to tell me it's too much money that 60 dollars cost too much money that's it because that's what it would cost you for real and you can make ice in your house and honestly it would increase that [ __ ] to where it's like that coloration is what people [ __ ] on full spec for is having that yellow yellowish tint but honestly like that that flower rosin could be [ __ ] fire hash rosin definitely if you can make that out of fat i've never seen flower awesome look like that no i've never seen flowers that's why i'm very surprised i thought he was impressed yeah oh no dude i was gonna be dude the very first thing i said to the guy being nice is i said yo my name is brett bird i didn't want to post on your page and cause conflict i wanted to ask you what you meant when you said flower rosin and hash rosin are different do you even know what you're talking about i pressed lots of flower rosin in my day but i know the difference between hash rosin i wanted to give you the chance to explain yourself explain yourself before i took it the wrong way and where was i said i thought that i said that right away i said you're flowers and cause i told him at one point i said your fire rosin looks fire that's it yeah there's nothing i just don't think you know how to make hash rawson because then you would know i said i remember the first time that i had made good hash austin and it blew my [ __ ] mind so like that's the difference is when you actually make some good ass ash housing straight up i imagine yeah i imagine because i never made flower rosin but also i've experienced it a bunch of times and it was it seemed to be just like with hash from cure or rosin from cured material it's a lot more likely you're going to get browner darker material and from what i know about flower rosin it's very sappy so it doesn't last as long because it all will uh oxidize yeah he tried to tell me he tried tommy and we are alive and we are recording that live yeah it um he he he um tried to say his doesn't deteriorate breakdown in arizona he does it yeah it's like yeah he just explodes i'll narrate if you want to read them he said when you take it from a botany point of view it's resin compared to store-bought material all the time i don't know what what yeah what he's trying to tell me that he's flowers he's compared to hash rosin in arizona no difference he said there's no difference is what he said and that's what got everybody going well honestly there's obviously a terpene profile difference if you can get just the flower to go get this i would love to taste that like i would actually like i would literally hit him up when going to the gym show in arizona next year or whatever [ __ ] i'm gonna hit him up and be like bro i'll buy like any small amount just to try it because i i really like i'm very curious if there is some type of like you know flavor either but you should you see that flower rosin that we pressed here didn't you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah totally no i was buyer too but yeah totally and i've seen one time very fire flower rather than get pressed but i just i wonder how it would be aged and just because this guy has a claim to fame for it so you know it's like awesome yeah he is very good though david goliath you know oh he has a bird video on there no this is yours i had some i was trying to find some flowers and then i'd get back in the day nerd for real i'll [ __ ] if he responds he went off and talked to me like nope he seemed like a fairly decent guy tell you the truth no and that's it that's really more so this is the battle of a lifetime oh wow yeah no that's fired auto buttered half of it autobuttered see i'm just curious because it's like that auto butter part would have maybe been the trichomes that popped and squeezed out and you know i mean it's like so it's like that's the fire and if if you watch the hash obviously that's what you would have gotten or something you know or something like yeah you would have got like the whole thing to be like that tiny little piece right there but not contaminated [Laughter] he's like trying to tell me like it doesn't fill your [ __ ] thing full of [ __ ] i'm like come on dude if i don't even use a bag when i smash my flower i'm like oh my god so you're like just picking all the particles out of it like what a [ __ ] layman wow that is some [ __ ] that is some [ __ ] yeah i'm sure he'll he'll talk to you though because he he he talked my ear off cool no that sounds like a great conversation he was the one that and he was all crying because nobody wanted to go to his page and none of his friends that's what he was saying as i was gonna tell you none of his friends wanted they were all mad because he's like i forgot he said how he said it everybody was [ __ ] all over his page is that him i hope oh no i wish yeah i hope that i wish and keep thinking about it is it easy that's all that means i was like oh no what did this guy do but that's still all right i mean i'm still impressed by his flower rosin regardless of his statement hash trolls just took that statement and ran with it and blew it in out of proportion when they yeah it's a bunch of hands is it one word oh okay it's two words well either way i'm gonna hit him up be like bro we are the hash trolls thank you so much took that statement and blew it out of proportion when they could have cleared it up with the conversation and spread that [ __ ] about me on ig like a 19 year old now i have all my followers dming me for the help because they don't want to be harassed in the area that they want to hang out and learn it no way oh my god the people are just around they're losing their ability to share and learn from each other as well as me learning from them in a public discussion and it's all hidden in the private comments what is happening because everybody just went off on him they all probably all deleted their own comments and privatized their comments or something like that or like or remove themselves from being his follower so it like [ __ ] up the whole threads that they were all reading that is really [ __ ] up if it was like a hash thread i'd be like dude but it's like there's literally a whole thing dude you don't you don't get it it's a whole [ __ ] thing everybody hates on flower rosin man everybody [ __ ] hates on it there's like a science why people do it the other way man you know it's like primitive technology that's all it's and it's laziness he even said dude the real truth that he held back was that he doesn't want to pay the money and spend the 60 dollars and [ __ ] do the effort he held it back and then he was like and that's it there's no like you know pencil drops everyone in the room is like wait what dude that's exact that's the whole point is doing a little bit extra work that's all i responded back yeah yeah oh my gosh that's just crazy because that probably the material he's watching would probably or he is not watching we probably watch amazing so great material he isn't watching a great job he's i'm sure it's beautiful the whole the listen so washing you know you're washing it you're cleaning it up you're washing it that's what you need to do to your material friend i tried to tell them that's what i said i said you'll someday you'll wash some hash and then your mind will be blown and then you'll know that's what you should have been doing straight up straight holy [ __ ] straight up it's hilarious he will life changing that's a holy [ __ ] type of thing it's just it's flower rosin is flower rosin i mean it's it's it's got its place that's why i try to tell them i was like dude i teach it at my class straight up i was like i was not trying to be a dick if i was trying to be a dick i would have just laughed at you like everyone else that's hilarious no and that's the whole thing is a teacher cannot even teach when a mind is not open no exactly but you're taught me a lot of stuff you're just trying to tell me just closed-mindedly that oh just tell me on a botany level and then i try to ask a question like well tell me the why the percentage of the thc is considerably lower on flower rosin and hash rosin would you not explain that to me then obviously there's there's your number like that should be your math right it should tell you percentage of thc is how much percentage of thc and then he didn't respond to that but then he's telling me how clear his rosin is when i sent a picture of my rosin and said well i don't think your roses is clear so there's something in it because it should be probably translucent like your [ __ ] is nice looking but it's not white and it's not clear so it's not those two right and then he said it's not all about color i see literally bro you just brought up and said it was yours is clear and then there and how is there any different because we're not people who care about color out of all no of all the raw this guy is not going to be somebody that's going to push [ __ ] you know but he knows enough about it to be able to tell you and make you think about your [ __ ] a little bit that's what's right and i don't think you knew what i was at all that i like try to promote it that i was like trying to teach people that is the funniest part too is that you actually promote using power off yeah more than anyone you know exactly and that's why i don't it she kind of made me feel like obviously you didn't take any time to figure out who i was or what i've been doing because i've been promoting that for a long time and i tell everybody all the time that you know you need to learn how to press fire rosin and then step up to pressing hash browse in and because he's like trying to tell me too well you know everybody can can make hash rosten and i'm like that's fine i understand that and it's a good way to start to get yourself to making hashtags it's not i've made plenty of fire offs i mean someone that say and not everybody can make hash dank duchess insisted to me no mila is a grandmother you know and she makes ash and then also it's like anybody can you know do a very small batch maybe not everybody can do a [ __ ] big ass badge right well you know it's like for real everybody can do a five gallon bucket you know everybody could turn a five gallon wash machine on and buy a [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go straight up you know more than anything beyond anything else you can use a machine a small machine you know but for real very simply use a little bag a little wash machine you get for sixty dollars on ebay you don't need to retrofit it like we all do all this cool different things you have to have always clean your tube really well make sure you don't leave anything behind and wash it with hot water and some rubbing alcohol out afterwards you know and you can even save that ribbon out over use it over and over for that same process and and if you ain't got no money or no ability to like modify the machine if that's too much for your to buying one that's already modified because they sell them now bolt bag sells one like mine wow i'll modify with a valve on it and everything in the front bigger hose so it's not the crinkle hose oh it's like you go by it's like 300 bucks so i think okay it's like i think it's seven gallons or something i've seen a few sets a little bigger is upgraded yeah yeah it's like fully retrofitted like like weed like frenchy digs and so yeah you could buy all that [ __ ] it's like 300 dollars too that's not much it's your come on yes really it's all excuses like that's what i tell everybody too that's some [ __ ] because you'll see that person right there has a ps5 or something you know what i mean like it's all [ __ ] oh i got no money i can't afford that but i drive a sick ass car that i do a ton of modifications to wait wait a minute oh [ __ ] you can afford whatever the [ __ ] you want you need priority for like what i said about the frenchie class i had no money to get to the frenchie class i couldn't stay the night in the hotel down there i drove for seven hours that day or eight hours to go to his class and come back and spent all day learning of class i was stoked that i could spend my food money to be able to pay for his ticket for his class you pay for what you want you make what you want exactly that's it dude that [ __ ] dude cedric took a bus down to l.a to get seeds that okay yeah yeah you think about it oh okay that [ __ ] took a bus to l.a you ain't got time ability to figure it out you don't want it no bam wow that's that's intense he took the track of the lights on yeah wow he took a [ __ ] bus to l.a yeah long hours oh actually yeah two days right or like a day and a half yeah if you just if he if you took the bus train bus train thing yeah could get down at like 12 hours like 12 hours one way wow one wow plane is an hour and a half so i will tell him that next time but march pits if he probably got a bus train bus straight 25 dollars yeah [Laughter] he probably got that exactly because if you want it it's [ __ ] happened no you're right holy bird that's you're the [ __ ] man of that you make me believe in inspiring a good question for you for why homie also would be really inclined to besides the work and extra effort that's involved when you were saying last time you were saying how much practice you get out of pressing material yeah which means you also i'm imagining get a little bit more material just to then disperse somebody did tell me you got a good yield on fire yeah like uh 20 percent that's what i would imagine yeah but that's not very much i mean because you're not i mean you're getting like 90 percent off hash oh [Laughter] right because you've already gotten the [ __ ] yield off of turning it into bubble hash yeah yeah so like that that's where it becomes where i but the problem would be more profitable for him so i think that definitely is what it's about though is just like we were saying it's all education and it's straight up it's not wrong present flower but it's just hilarious that i i did i did want to kind of break it down for him but i started feeling like it was a waste of my time to even break it down yeah because it was like he was making like you said actually i didn't think about it that way you can't teach someone that's not wanting to learn so that's what it felt like it'd be wasting my time because he wouldn't absorb any of the information i would be giving him you know a light that he could use it later ever because he would always be negatively thinking about everything i'm saying to to just argue with me or second guess me exactly bias yeah because he's already doing he's got like all his flowers he's got to stand by exactly exactly somebody's gonna grab him and make him watch hash you know his best friend will do that for him you know somebody needs to you know well that's all i mean like so you're you know who else would grab you and shake you in you know i mean like he said i said i understand you know you might not have access to material and stuff like that and that's a big difference but there's a lot of different aspects of it too you know like having access somebody that has access to a lot of material is gonna have more material in the long run if they freeze it all because you could have more stuff to learn from if you learn out throughout the whole year but like if i turn all that and dried it i'm going to have very limited time to be able to press that into flower rose a very small window of time that i can press good flower oz and it looked like what he just did a very small window and so um it's fine for him because he's only producing such a small amount and he's only got flour but if he had like if he had like a real farm to deal with that would be like a joke it's just kind of funny because he has no idea and i was trying to explain that to him a little bit like if a real farm was like here you could have this and for you to turn that into flower rosin it wouldn't be realistic because you're not gonna have the room to dry all that material and you're also not gonna have the ability to get it all dried at the right time and put into a bag and then press into rosin before it dries out and goes back so like the only way to do a whole farm would be you have to deal with it on a different scale like and you dry it and then you can turn it into hash rosin because you could dry it and stick the weed into a freezer then you can deal with that throughout the year because you can pull the flour out and wash hash rosin that would be a viable way to do it but just making flower rods it's not really going to be a viable way you if you had a farm that said you could take this whole farm and turn it in whatever you wanted fire rising would not be a valuable option for that at all because this is not realistic like to dry all that and to turn it into rosin in a realistic time sense it wouldn't happen it would be garbage some of it would be good and some wouldn't and and so but you could turn it into hash rosin or live rosin the whole farm i'd have a consistently quality product and you wouldn't be able to with flowers just literally wouldn't be able to because there's such a small window of time that can be pressed into a product would have to be like a week you could so if you had like a whole farm like my family's farm you physically couldn't sit there with and press flowers and fast enough before it went back amazing so that's very intense cost and space and like where would you put it all no for frozen doesn't take up as much space as you think you could take a whole farm because you process it down off the stem and off the big leaves so you actually take a whole farm and you can put it down into turkey bags and freeze those turkey bags and turn a good farm into chest freezers and you can't really do that same scale and drying it to to dry what i've put in my freezers you would need a [ __ ] massive dry room massive to be able to dry the amount you can put into a freezer to get air flow yeah you know what i mean like if you're really just trying to like you hang dry weed in a room and they would you would just be really just really huge amount of scale and you're going to be very limited like the day that you can start pressing fire rosin you're going to have like two days or three days or a week and then it's going to be garbage so if you have little [ __ ] rooms full of this [ __ ] and you're going to press it and then after you press it it's not gonna be as good because it's full of [ __ ] other material because it's got a lower thc percentage straight up there's a lot of problems there's a lot it's one of the reasons why this is not a viable source to take all that material and turn it into a concentrate which is like why tim was kind of being a dick when he was talking to me but was right and that's why he was being a dick about it was you're wasting your time pressing foul rolling he was just a dick about how he said it to me he could have been a lot nicer and more considerate on like yeah you're really learning your craft that's awesome good job you're doing a good job like i was trying to do to that guy kind of that's what i was just thinking literally i was going to say that before is that you tried to give this guy the nice yeah what the [ __ ] exactly is [Laughter] [Music] oh i didn't put you on blast like everybody else wasn't my war i couldn't i could have been a dick to him so it's so funny and i didn't when you so you'd go right from a turkey bag do you tie them up and then throw them in the free in the chest and just let it be full as you can [ __ ] stuff it full doesn't really matter too much all right and that and that's how it basically dries or is that waiting until it's frozen in state it's exactly just like you cut it off the plant and then when you go to work with it again well freeze not right no no such thing no freeze drying later after you're removing i imagine that that freeze drying occurs like same way frostbite and like the condensation occurs if it falls out it's moist and wet so i accidentally let some thought out right when i was loading so that's not really the problem you're occurring here because what's happening is it's freezing the trichome so like it probably frost bites the flour but you're not extracting the flour right you're getting the trichome off of it it's just freezing so so you're freezing the whole material wow but the the the material might be frostbitten like if you were gonna eat the the flour like you were gonna eat a steak you know what i mean in a sense you freeze the steak and get frostbitten because i thought about this too but the trichomes not getting receiving frostbite because it's not water right and it's not it's not water soluble like that well no you don't have it in water either right well i'm saying the water being the ice water that's not in it oh it's next to it yeah it's not like in liquid water exactly it's just next to the frozen state of material because it's not you're and you're just removing the trichome yeah so like you probably do create some frostbite to the flower if it sits in there long enough but from my experience i'll wash it that's a year and a half two years old and it doesn't seem any different when you're washing it because what's happening is the trichome has been just frozen in its own separate state as a flower and you've just removed them and then you discard the flour they've just probably been frostbitten now and it could have excess moisture and everything else obviously froze inside yeah so but the trichome didn't matter because it was a different liquid that was frozen on its own and it doesn't have water in it or oxygen in it for it to have a frostbite actually uh effectively any agent or damage at all yeah it's in its frozen state yeah and it's not connected to anything else so it's just waiting for you to come and knock it off later that's awesome i was wondering how long it lasted the other thing that i was thinking is like you said um one large chest can hold probably like a green house yeah i mean like if you've got a 20 foot chest you could probably fit a [ __ ] huge green a big big-ass greenhouse in there if you wanted you know and if you really have to do what you do is like you can if you you can kind of like grab the turkey bag and squeeze it just a tiny bit to remove some of the excess air that's in that turkey bag and that when you when you twist it and just put like a twist tie thing on the top the turkey bags come with and then put it in the freezer that'll actually give you a lot more space in your freezer without really damaging any of the product at all because you're just kind of barely squeezing the air out you're not like and you don't put in the bag and like squish the [ __ ] out of it valuable information for next season straight up yeah for real seriously yeah you should be delicate don't cut anything with scissors don't expose that leaf surface to leach water out in to the chlorophyll into the water so you don't want to use scissors on the leaves at all when you process down so that would be but you wouldn't buck it with the scissors no you could do that that's not not with a scissor though i wouldn't do the scissors that that but you're not i wouldn't do a scissor because i'd be more worried about other things happening and there's going to be less control with the pair of scissors because you won't have any of the feel that you'll have with your hand there's a technique that you get when you do it with your hand that you can actually feel it achieving what you're trying to by popping all the buds off and not grabbing one or grabbing the next as you grab them and like [ __ ] them up at all and without the the feel of your fingers you won't really have that and you you could possibly grab some leaves while you're doing this in the process that are just in there and then cut the leaves with the scissors and if you're doing this with your hand you're not going to actually cut any of the leaves that you do grab in the same fashion i really would tell everybody just just leave the scissors alone don't even don't have your scissors like touching any of that horribly so because if you do you could like buck him down the scissors to like put it into a bin and then have somebody just sitting there bucking it into a bucket well part of it is is i guess everybody's used to or where i'm coming from with the bucking ideology is from dry product and so bucking a dry product you can feel that pop with the scissor and it goes and also if you did it by hand you would just dust all your [ __ ] nugs in this sense you can't because it's a full [ __ ] plant it's not just going to pop off easy yeah it's different snip if you were gonna snip them yeah it's different when you push and crush like that [ __ ] what would normally dust the whole nug is actually just gonna pull it off because it's a [ __ ] live plant yeah and string it and stuff like that so it's just different yeah you wanna you want to just ideally you'd want to just pop each nug off no and put it in the bag [ __ ] yeah man um so here i'm gonna i'm gonna end this and yeah we'll figure that stuff all out here", "TAmnp-JXgOI": "We at Revolutionary Clinics are proud to\nbring you our products directly from our farm.

rods and prescott CA is sending me my own custom thing and I'll be pressing in my condo and bringing it all to your life and helping work with Chris to dial in the different strains what you return but here's a good example where you get a little over two ounces fifty point eight one grams and boom there it is and what we're thinking about doing tonight and what we're testing right now is just running an aide looking at what return we get on the nebula and we just might run a house it and see what kind of return we get on that so this is a good example of the rosin take all organic this is what matters again we're talking about where's the government going to go with our V Smith our V Smith is gonna look at the bottom you're gonna say no more solvents that's what I believe and when they come out and they say that it's going to be very hard for the extraction crews that are using new tain and other products as as such I believe co2 and stuff like rosin will be the future of doubts that being said this is Jason Wilcox we'll see in the next part as we continue to rosin press at weeds on Main Street 2016 on the eve of 4/20 Cheers all right welcome out cannabis to Canada now we're here once again with Chris Nelson know a lot of people online seen the press from the nebula and I got a lot of feedback from the good Roz and pressors out there and rasa prescott CA is gonna be sending me my own press for my condo and will be doing a lot of pressing and a lot of videos about different strains one thing I've learned from Chris who's been doing this a lot is that different strains provide different squishers like different returns and I found it phenomenal that the UH nebula I didn't even bother I was gonna press a half pound of it I didn't bother doing and I looked at what this does this returns at 20% net really returns at 10% so Chris won't you damn it first off tell us what you're doing and then demonstrate what you've also you don't throw in the exact details but what you what you've dialed in here what you learned I'm doing this all from my own trial and error so in the last video I think I had my bottom plate set at 180 it wasn't even on so now I've dialed both plates both plates are up to 20 degrees so nom I've been playing with 200 degrees and I noticed that it's it's really exploding like with rosin oh this is gonna be this is gonna be good because I'm starting to learn some stuff and I'm making all these notes and I compare and so yeah I've increased my temperature from the last time and my bottom plates working I'm not gonna measure but you guys are gonna see the the clearly there's gonna be a rose and explosion right now let's do it and I have you felt it then no exactly are the very solid tight nugs yeah you can definitely see Oh to room and hats off to that grower cuz it's just tricky tricky and that's a big thing too is just a Detroit development those out there with pink pushes and that they another very tricky strain might be interested in checking on the squishing twenty that Girl Scout cookies that's a good question or two I'm the best strain force collisions in my short time of doing rosin is God's green crack if you guys squish that you will not be disappointed you know twenty five percent return beautiful to see twenty to twenty five percent now this is what someone the the the experts out there was saying that's what you should be getting now what I'm just trying to figure out is is that strain dependent or is that actually method dependent and we're gonna find that out fifteen tons if you guys can see we have rosin how long you leave that on there press that on there for about another five seconds its but I have the temperature in my opinion set low enough I'm not going to cook the rosin and I'm not going to cook the Terps so I could leave it on there for another five or ten seconds well here we go folks so this is true OG and I'm just with my preliminary measurements we're doing it about 20% which is this strains a good strain in my rule of thumb I'm think I'm gonna go anything over 15% to me as a dispensary and I'm going to supply the dispensaries is good enough if it's a 15% or plus or unless it's like maybe 13% but it's a legendary strain mi presa - well I'm wondering if do you notice the difference at all in your end product with some of the different strains coming in it may not have been flushed as well I haven't gotten that far yet but most of the stuff has been that that the weeds franchise has is flushed pretty good like he can you could look it under the microscope and you can we test that we do a burn test and it's all really good so we have a mat we have a Negroni Organic Master Kush I'm ready - pretty excited about possibly squishing that the returns at about I think 12% it's a and but Organic Master Kush it might be one of those strains that might consider pressing because everyone loves Master Kush well I do it's by one of their first strains that one in orange came over in my first two strains a group exactly the being a legendary strain and purely or all organic I'm kind of tempted I'm leaning towards on my presses so that's if we didn't sell it all in the stores already there's always a ways to use it so you really get two presses out of your rosin then you get the pucks afterwards so there's a lot of uses to doing rosin a lot of people just don't see the initial return and they don't see the values such as the recycling the pucks anything you want to say in closing Kris yeah just I I'm really excited about President as rosin and supplying the whole franchise what's rosin potentially I think it's going to work oh well and the whole reason why I'm doing it is because chatter and butter is great solvents I'm trying to steer our franchise a little bit away from the like there's a bit of a demand for it but personally I'd if I was if I'm doing dabbing and when I'm doing Davin I want to do solvent less so soul unless I think cannabis extracts yes they have that they have non legislated are versus Smith and I keep telling everybody the only thing they could possibly legislate in our versus Smith is cannabis in all of its forms while you can't have solvents because solvents aren't part of cannabis now that would be the only division that would make you know policy sense and potentially what they're gonna throw on us remember they're not happy about the legislative arm throwing all this language at them because it's very hard to legislate both alert and arvy Smith yeah definitely yeah it's exciting times that this is one this is a really good time to be alive in Canada or even North America Oh also us on that's awesome bro right I look forward to working with you more all right stay tuned for more from Canada's in Canada as we roll over on the city of Vancouver it is the eve of 4/20 everybody [Music] [Music]", "8k2thhwHyG0": "today on gearing gadgets we have a premium rosin from the land down under it's leatherwood rosin let's get into this [Music] what's up my fearless friends shayshawn fan and mcpherson back with another gearing gadgets today we have leatherwood rosin bespoke all the way from australia can't wait to try this out but first let's get to this unboxing we have a handwritten note which is very nice i've ordered from these guys before and they're rising if it's anything like it was a couple of years ago is amazing one of the features i really like is this leather handmade leather pouch for rosin i mean i've never seen any other rosin do this this is what the rosin looks like all these little details and this is a beautiful rosin that comes from the saps of trees in australia der sheishan thank you for your order we hope that you love your 100 crisp viola recipe which andrew has poured into a beautiful piece of tasmanian myrtle enjoy andrew it's the little details that count hand written can't wait to play it let's get some of this rosin on the bow so what i want to do is get the rising off two chest bows one is a bow by coda and this is just a generic bow uh from like sam ash that i got cheap um i do have a more expensive bow i could use but i think i'm gonna go with these two for today so the first thing you want to use to get the rosin off the bow safely is acetone acetone is similar to thing you know the chemical and nail polish remover so we're going to pour a little bit carefully unscrew the bow now the acetone is going to go into the bowl here but it won't harm the bow it's one of the it's a chemical that you can safely use and what you want to do is just dip it directly in and the bow hairs will act like a candle wick leatherwood actually has a good video on youtube on how to do this don't go all the way to the ends because it will be absorbed and it will dry fast try not to dip the bow itself in either and i'm gonna let this dry so now that that bow here has dried we will put this coated bowl back together and we'll start to rising now some people might use a little sandpaper or take their key and scratch it but this rosin is expensive 99 i'm gonna start out putting rosin on the bow and do it naturally and see how long it takes me always make sure to put your thumb here unless you crack your new rising [Music] so on the koda bowl we have the leatherwood rosin and we will try to play something [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] so i want to get into some of more of the details on uh leatherwood bespoke rosin and um what the experience is like when you go to their website and get this premium verizon so let's go so like i said they are australian-based company and i'm not sure how i got put on to them i don't know if it was a fellow violinist or violist that told me about it but i did get some rising a couple of years ago and i liked it then unfortunately i think i broke it i think it fell off a stand or something silly but let's go to the rosin that i just tested you see they got ultimate leatherwood pack violin viola and cello violin ryzen they have different mixes and packs and on the website it's kind of cool they show like them mixing it and boiling the sat and the whole process so i actually got uh what's interesting the viola rosin and as you can see it's 99 i wanted it because i play a five string um so it's like playing viola and violin and the strings are a little thicker so let's get into what i think real quick um i thought it sounds good overall i i think you're getting what you pay for for the 99 but uh i really like the leather carrying case well it's a love hate i'll get into that later i think the rosin has a great sound it cuts through it kind of like rolls off nice almost like a nice uh dslr camera the highlights the high pitches roll off like the highlights do on the camera that's good um i also noticed that there was less residue on my bow and on the instrument after playing for a while and the cons were that rosin can slip out that leather case i think that's how i broke it last time um if you can see here on the edges you know it can fall out of that if you don't have it tight most rosin you know it comes wrapped up or in the case i love the the leather roll up but it can fall out it can slip out of there um and also because this open is exposed to the elements once you take out your case i think maybe if you live in a climate where it's warmer uh it might affect these edges of the rosin in my opinion especially if you don't have a k if you're using an electric case instead of a you know a really high-end case for your acoustic but you have it in your electric violin case it could be exposed to the elements but i guess you wouldn't put this premium rosin in that case so that's basically it i want to thank the folks over at leatherwood uh for you know sending this to me all the way from australia i'm gonna put it to good use i hope it lasts me a couple of years once again i'm shayshawn fandom mcpherson come to the next episode let me know what you might want to know about for a guy who plays violin viola and is also a dj and mixes those two subscribe subscribe and like thank you guys you", "pXoBBZ7mN58": "here today dr ahn thank you so much uh biogal for this opportunity and for making this wonderful webinar possible i enjoy tighter testing and the aim of this webinar is for all of you to be comfortable to do the same in your own clinics um i moved from england to new jersey usa in 2015. so i'm now a dvm here licensed to practice in new jersey as well so i'm hoping that my experience in india in england and here uh will help you all realize how important this is so um welcome everyone and thanks for tuning in today i am now going to uh share my screen and go ahead with the webinar so the main aim of this webinar is to show you how you can successfully implement tiger testing in your very own clinic and the learning outcomes i would like to elucidate are going to focus on what core vaccine tighter testing is uh why it's important and also how uh you can go ahead and incorporate this in your practice so to start off we will define core vaccine tighter testing then we will talk about a review of why core vaccine title testing is so important in clinical practice in today this world i will talk about your my personal experience and a point of care model for the same and finally i'll give you a simple way of how you can implement it without worrying about loss of revenue and making sure that we are all practicing evidence-based uh medicine for the sake of the pets uh and the pet guardians so uh i am a big uh follower and i trust what the world small animal veterinary association tells us and there is no doubt that vaccination is vital and it's a very very important contributor to wellness of an animal i am not an anti-vaxxer and this is something i would like to make very clear vaccination is necessary and we need to address how important it is uh simply because even today in spite of all the vaccinations we've done in developed countries there are still geographical pockets of infection and sporadic outbreaks of the key diseases and in developing countries like india for example we find that you still see a lot of uh you know diseases on a regular basis and they can be a major cause of mortality in small animals even today as you all know you've probably heard the term herd immunity vaccination is not just about one individual animal it's about providing optimum herd immunity that protects a lot of individuals and minimizes the likelihood of sudden disease outbreaks so when we talk about herd immunity we are basically talking about protecting a population and this is the biggest takeaway i want you to have from this webinar and that is you need to have vaccinated more number of animals rather than just repeatedly vaccinating the same animals in order to attain herd immunity so please please remember this point that we really really need to vaccinate more animals but at the same time we need to focus on the numbers rather than repeated vaccination of the same animal so i hope that makes it clear the next slide shows you a very good reason another reason why we shouldn't be vaccinating the same animal again and again if it's already protected the vaccine guidelines in the wsaba are very clear about it they say it's important to reduce the vaccine load on individual animals so that you can minimize the possibility or the potential for adverse reactions to the vaccine products it could be the adjuvant it could be the protein it could be the actual killed virus for whatever reason we have to try and do our best to minimize these adverse reactions which is why they went ahead and made the proposal after doing a lot of analysis and studies that vaccines should be divided into core vaccines and non-core vaccines so core meaning compulsory and non-core meaning optional vaccines that's the simplified word to explain it but there's more to it so let us say that it's we all know that a large majority of dogs can maintain protective antibodies against the canine distemper virus the canine parvovirus ii the cannon adenovirus 1 and adenovirus 2 for many many years and there are many studies that have supported this so this is based on strong evidence and there is proof that the duration of immunity after vaccination with a modified live vaccine is as long as nine years and sometimes it can be as much as the lifetime of a pet and again this is based on challenge and serological studies one very good paper i would recommend you all read is in the journal of comparative pathology 2010 by dr schultz and thia and mukhtar and it talks about the duration of immunity and also about the age and how long it lasts based on modified life vaccines so please if you get a chance look up this paper you should the reason i'm specifying modified lime vaccine is that there's a difference between what a modified live vaccine does versus what a killed vaccine does versus what a recombinant vaccine can do and it's the modified live vaccine that have been proven to have the most uh doi so uh you know uh you can do a little bit more research if you would like but it's very fascinating to understand that so it's not just any vaccine it has to be a modified life vaccine to have the longest immunity so let us see the difference between core and non-core vaccines the simplified way was calling them compulsory and not compulsory but in reality a core vaccine is a vaccine that is required by every dog and cat in order to protect them from life-threatening infectious diseases that are still prevalent throughout the world okay and these usual diseases are such that prevention is far more cheaper and far more better than the actual cure and sometimes you cannot cure them in fact all you can do is give them supportive treatment which is why it's called a core of disease and a core vaccine the non-core vaccines are required based on geographical location the local environment the lifestyle and also based on the animals risk to contracting a specific infection and these vaccines usually require an annual booster uh this is something you should keep in mind so an example of this could be something like lepto whereas an example of a core vaccine could be your parvo uh i will explain this more in the next slide so here we go so these are the core vaccines which can be tighter tested accurately and they are in dogs the hepatitis i uh ich the parbo virus and the canine distemper and in cats it's a pan leukopenia the herpes virus and the kalichi virus um i'm going to focus more on the dog canine vaccines today simply because uh my experience is more as far as tidal testing goes with dogs and also because i find the testing far more accurate so what does a core vaccine tighter testing show us okay so it will clearly show us that a pet is immunized or not so to define it a tighter test for core vaccines reveals if a pet is already immunized from a previous vaccination by actually detecting the antibodies if an animal has antibodies then there is no need to revaccinate because in essential uh the reality is that you're already protected hope that makes sense um so again going back to the wall small animal veterinary association guidelines they have uh confirmed that for the core diseases in both dogs and cats there is a very good correlation between the presence of serum antibody and protective immunity and therefore these antibody tests may be useful in monitoring the immunity and as far as dogs go the serological testing for canine distemper virus the canaan adenovirus and this canine parvovirus uh and as far as cats go the feline pan leukopenia virus we can say for sure that this testing has shown that it is effective in predicting the protective immunity in the puppy or the kitten it also gives us advice on how often you need to revaccinate adult dogs and it also helps us manage infectious disease outbreaks in shelters in a much more better way rather than blind vaccination we'll explain more about this in the next slide so um so if you look at the very first um picture you will see that one of the key indications both by the aha and wasaba is that puppies and kittens can be tighter tested after completing a vaccination series when they are about six months of age that is after 24 weeks of age in order to confirm that they are actually immunized this is the key word vaccination does not necessarily mean the puppy or the kitten is immunized and that could be because vaccine failure is definitely possible it could be because of their genetic non-responders or because the vaccine itself has poor immunogenicity um 24 weeks you might ask why is that and that's because we have to ensure that the maternal antibodies are out of the system and it's also the recommendation of the wsa va to wait that long before you try to test um puppies and kittens to confirm immunization the another good uh way is to check if a geriatric or a sick pet who is not necessarily a good candidate for a booster vaccine already is protected so we know very well that you are not you shouldn't be vaccinating a sick or immunocompromised or an animal with immune mediated disease like immunity mediated hemolytic anemia or immune mediated thrombocytopenia and an animal that has a previous history of a severe adverse reaction to vaccine um administration so in these sick cases the tighter testing is a great idea because by type by looking for antibodies you can be sure that this pet is vaccinated or correct me um immunized another good um application is in just the adult pet we can see if it has antibodies and we can also see if it has already had prior vaccination because this will be confirmed by the tidal test you can also see you know if let us say it's a dog with unknown history you can do a pre-breeding assessment of its immunity if you were going if it was an expensive stud or a or a that a dam you were going to use and finally if you have an emergency and you have a dog admitted in the hospital you don't know the vaccination history you're worried what to do you just have to do a tighter test and you feel so much more happy that you have an animal that is immunized you don't have to worry about you can take those core diseases out of your list of differentials um as well finally um what i find very useful is when i'm here in usa i have worked for some shelters and most of these dogs that come in you don't know who the owner is you don't have a vaccination history so just by tighter testing you can know if this animal is protected for december predicted for pavo protected for um you know infectious canine hepatitis and you don't have to worry about isolating because the moment they are protected it's good for you and also you can manage a disease outbreak because by tighter testing you know who is the one who even though was vaccinated did not uh you know produce the immune response and maybe contributed to the outbreak hope um that's a lot to take in but if you think about it logically it makes a lot of sense basically tighter testing is your proof of immunization as opposed to just vaccination and believing it's worked so as far as puppies and kittens go uh we talked about it in the previous slide too but i thought i should reiterate the reason why tighter testing them is important um and that's because some vaccines are poorly immunogenic so immunogenicity if you think about it is the ability of a vaccine to provoke an immune response and it can fail for a number of factors and for example there might be a problem with the way the cold chain was interrupted so the vaccines have to be stored at a certain temperature it's possible that somewhere down the line that was messed up so the vaccine is actually not good but you didn't know that you vaccinated the puppy and the vaccine didn't work or it could be because you gave too little a dose because i have seen some people worry about oh my god this is such a tiny chihuahua why am i getting so much vaccine and you might think it's best not to give that much or you might miss or you know i have known some people who have injected a cat vaccine into a dog because they've been so busy i mean it happens and the puppy is not protected and you probably didn't realize and the most important reason could be that there are maternal antibodies circulating which stop the vaccine from creating that response and then you have this important reason the animal could be a poor responder its immune system intrinsically fails to recognize the vaccine antigens as a result the animal is not immunized and here's a some data to tell you that genetic non-responders in the dog population can be as much as one in every thousand dogs for canine parvo virus one in every five thousand dogs for canine distemper virus and one in every hundred thousand dogs for canine adenovirus and they might look like not so big numbers but for that particular puppy or dog it could be life and death which is why when i work for the pdsa in england i have seen that even puppies that have been vaccinated for parvo supposedly vaccinated with proof have come in with parvo and you know you find it surprising but for all you know these could be one of the reasons uh so moving on to the next slide um the wsava has then come up with this publication which talked about what sort of tighter testing and kits would work so based on that they have come up uh and authorized or okayed certain rapid and simple in practice serological test kits that are able to detect protective antibodies specific for canine distemper virus adenovirus and canine parvovirus and two commercially produced test kits are available they have been applied and validated both both in a clinical practice setting and a shelter setting and they are popular and i can vouch for that and it's excellent for those of us who want to practice evidence-based medicine and we can offer clients an alternative to just routinely vaccinating animals with dap every three years and um one of those kids that i personally i'm a big fan of and have experience with and used a lot is the backseat check by biogal in fact uh apart from sending off uh the rabies uh you know uh uh tighter testing you know when i used to issue pet passports england i used to constantly send off uh blood to after vaccination uh you know with rabies vaccine you have to send the blood off to ensure that they have enough titers otherwise you cannot really sign the passport and confirm that this dog is protected for rabies and uh you know that is your classic example about how just vaccination is not proof of immunization and because rate because england was israelis free uh we had to ensure that when an animal traveled abroad it was protected from rabies so anyway a bit of diversion there but coming back to this so as far as in clinic uh tighter testing goes i use vaccine and if you can see this uh picture here this is how the kit looks like it's very simple and it has the uh you can see like a little comb over there that is the immunocomb and you can see that and that is the uh developing plate um the developing plate contains the reagents that are needed for the comb development and the comb that one you will find it has antigens attached to each tooth and the placement of the antigens is shown by the labeling on the comb which i will show you in the next slide so this is a an example of a vaccine developed combs and you see the numbers 1 to 12 are refer to each dog or each blood sample so this could be dog ones blood dog 2's blood or 3's blood all the way to 12. so the beauty of waxy check is that you can do 12 samples in one go okay and if you look at this the first one is the positive reference or the control and then that's canine adenovirus canine parvovirus and canine distemper virus okay and this is your again this shows you i will i wanted to move on to the next slide because this explains what that color intensity was so take a look at the previous slide and you will see that there are in this one for example this is the control and all these look almost same color this one this is darker this is about the same this is a little bit lighter so this this is very important and it's actually not as difficult as you might think in fact it's pretty straightforward and you can um the next slide will explain how so if you're if your color intensity is white or has a trace of gray it basically means the test is negative there are no detectable antibodies for any one of these three diseases okay and then you give it a score of zero to one if there is a faint gray as compared to the control you can say that it's a weak positive and you would give it a score of two and if it's a nice distinct gray it's called a significant positive and you would give it a score of three to four and this one is what we would all like to see but doesn't always happen is the high positive and that shows a dark gray and we give it a score of five to six um the important thing to know is this sentence just because your uh the particular dog came up with the weak positive doesn't necessarily mean that it has no immunity the presence of antibody no matter what it's tighter indicates protective immunity but if it's negative it means that you have to revaccinate because it clearly shows that this animal has no antibodies for this and going back to the previous slide you might find a situation sometimes so take five for example this is clear because it shows that there is immunity for cav for uh hepatitis barbo and distemper but sometimes i have seen cases in fact my own dog joy i did his tighter test recently because he came from rescue and he had strong positive for parvo strong positive for ich but negative for this temper and he had been given a vaccine two times since he came to the rescue and he was about four months old when he came there so i if i hadn't tighter tested there's no way i would have known that he's not protected for this temper you could argue that december is not big now but he's under two years old so he still has a chance so then i decided to vaccinate him uh for all three because you know it's hard to get a distemper vaccine on its own but i did it but if you can and let us say a dog showed high positive for this temper uh you know positive for adenovirus but did not was fail the parvo you could always just give it the parbo vaccine so you see you're basically doing uh the right thing by the dog by giving it what it needs so this is important if there is a medical reason not to vaccinate the dog then you shouldn't but in most cases like my dog for example if an antibody is absent for a particular disease you should be re-vaccinating the dog to protect it this one was actually a game changer for me because i like the whole visual thing because it's pretty straightforward and you know the more you do the more better you get at it but this one helps me confirm that what my eyes are seeing is right so what you can do is um if you look at the comb there is a little you can break it that line so you can break this comb into individual comb where you have that little indent so you can break them and read them as individual results using this um device uh called comcam it's very tiny and it comes with two separate cards one is for the uh canine maxi check and one is for the feline for the um vaccine check and i found it very useful because i didn't have it in england but i have it here in usa it was brilliant you just slide it in it immediately gives you the score and you know the result and you don't have to worry if it's a small gray slight gray you know you don't have to worry about any of that it gives you the value it can be connected up to a pc or laptop and you can do electronic documentation so it's basically an electronic eye and i like to test everything before i tell anyone and um i like to double check myself double guess myself and this is great because i will do my um reading and then i will double check with this and i would recommend this little um handy electronic eye it made my job how shall i say it made me a lot more confident when i was reporting the results okay so now we come to the topic of how you go about implementing titus testing in your actual clinic this is actually the main focus and the most interesting part of today's webinar but um i would like dr ahn to come in and he wants to do a small poll with all of you and then i will come back and talk about this great uh dr satish you've done a great job and i wanted to say that the questions have been pouring in so obviously people are very inspired by your presentation you are creating a lot of thought-provoking questions ideas and i think we're gonna have a fantastic q a session so folks uh we uh are going to continue to ask you please send in the questions i'm really impressed with the quality and the thoughtfulness of all of these questions and points that are being made and we are going to actually not run the poll uh today we'll run that on another day but dr satish you've done a great job and let's let you uh resume to the second part of your presentation and then we'll have the q a okay it's fine by me i've had my little water break so i'm going back to screen sharing now okay so i uh have put this into four sections um because these are the four ways i do tighter testing i are for situations where i would tie the test okay as part of the annual pet health check as part when you complete a copy vaccination course and and that's a reiterate should be between um six months or one year and this is my favorite the titan clinic and finally discretionary so as and when one needs it so i will go through each one step by step but my focus will be on this and i'll explain why so one of the reasons why we have to do tighter testing and i believe it's the future is because we have the clients who are very very aware they're well informed and you know they're all very influenced by dr google so there is an increased demand from pet owners to not uh vaccinate every time they come to see you for an annual health check they want to practice the best evidence-based medicine for their pet and especially in the usa i have seen so many who are just happy to come in for a yearly health check without necessarily having the yearly vaccination at that point um and i wanted to put this slide out there to you because again this is from the wsaba and it clearly says um the question i mean read the question quickly it says in an animal that has completed its puppy kitten shots is a higher antibody titer required to protect against heavy disease so you see they're talking about volumes number of vaccines things like that and the answer from the wsav research in 2016 is this for remember it's for these vaccines for canine distemper vaccine for canine adenovirus for parvo and for feline pan leukemia the answer is no the presence of antibody no matter what the titer indicates a protective immunity and immunological memory present in that animal so just by giving more frequent vaccines to animals in an attempt to increase antibiotic antibody tighter is a pointless exercise just digest this information for me the whole thought process that the more vaccines you give the more immunized the animal is is false it is impossible to create greater immunity by attempting to increase an antibody titer so just because uh let's say an antibody times tighter come i mean obviously there are certain values you have to follow if it's rabies but for these diseases as long as the animal is positive it's immunized it is capable of summoning or producing that immune response and mustering it to fight a disease if it's exposed to the virus full stop so giving more frequent vaccines to animals just to increase the antibody tighter is pointless um so we move on here for example when in the usa we do we call it the this is something new because i was in england and this is not what it was called we call it the annual wellness check and in the annual wellness check we do all these things so we check the weight we check uh the teeth which we do sometimes do a blood test and then we always tend to vaccinate but now i have clients telling me i would rather vaccine check and confirm that my animal is protected then rather than just vaccinating so this is a great opportunity during your annual health check instead of just offering a vaccine you could offer the tighter test and include that in like a package price another thing which is very popular in the usa as opposed to england is that we always offer a heartwarm test because heartworm is big in at least certain parts of the united states and you're going to draw blood anyway for a heartwarm test the same blood you can use to also do a vaccine check test at the same time and all you have to tell the owner is that you know you want to in you want to check if the animal has enough tighter before vaccinating you can get the results on the same day because you're going to do it yourself and then you can call them up and say yeah your dog your dog's immunized so you don't need the vaccine this year and you're actually allowed to give just like the dap is now being given every three years you can do the vaccine check every three years so there is a change in how the clients are dealing with vaccinations too i get as a holistic integrative veterinarian i see lots of clients who come to me asking me to not vaccinate and give the annual booster but instead do a vaccine check and then decide what which way to go based on the results another way of doing this would be in a puppy kitten vaccination package let's say uh this is the best kind of practice this is what we call evidence-based medicine you're supposed to give the first dose of um the dap or dhpp as you call it note without the lepto i'm not saying you should be giving the lepto at this point because it's a known core vaccine i'm talking about just the core vaccine here and if you are going to do the lecture as part of this that's fine you could give it on its own and then do a vaccine check for dap so the first dose would be at six to eight weeks the second dap dose would be at 10 to 12 weeks the third dose that's 14-16 weeks to ensure there are no maternal antibodies so that 16 week is very important and then finally you would waxy check the puppy four weeks after the last vaccination um to confirm that it is actually immunized to confirm it's not a non-responder to confirm that there are no maternal antibodies and everything else and you could make this like a you know like a puppy package and i'm telling you this is going to be the future because more and more clients would rather have this than have you just you know re-vaccinate without ensuring that their animal is actually vaccinated then we go on to this topic and i'll tell you how i went about doing my first title clinic and this was in 2015 in merseyside in england i was researching for my book called you can heal your pet which i was writing with an animal healer and there was a lot of discussion about tighter testing and about the whole concept of um vaccination and i wrote a whole chapter called the vaccination debate and while i was researching i wanted to see for myself if this whole tighter testing thing was real if it was valid if it was something i could really advocate for in the book uh because i didn't want to you know do something i didn't believe it so fortunately i met this wonderful woman who was um i know she's not the kind of person you might as a veterinarian want to have in your list of uh clients she's an anti-vaxxer but she had a passion for tighter testing so she would almost every other week or sometimes once a month she would get 25 people who wanted to have tighter testing for their pets and they would come from all parts of merseyside and from different veterinary surgeries they're not just my clients so i would my aim was not to you know um you know steal clients or anything it was literally just to provide a service so i would go to her location which was a raw food shop with my maxi check kit which would be delivered there and i would be there from 10 to 4 p.m we would she would have booked 24 dogs for the day and they are all people who are very keen on tighter testing and you know i would they would all sign forms so that we get a history on you know what their vaccination history was i would do i would take blood from 10 12 dogs in an hour or so and sometimes they would end up chatting a bit but yeah you can just draw blood and then it was just me and her we would draw blood then they would be quiet and i would sit down with my maxi check kit and run the test 23 minutes is all it took and i would be doing 12 tests in one go and that's 12 tests done for the morning i would fill out the form and pass it on and the certificates would be ready very soon then in the afternoon another 12 dogs would come in i would take blood from all of them and then they would go away i would again run the test myself in that premise because i would collect the blood and edta tubes so they don't clot this is something you have to remember you don't need a centrifuge you can do it with whole blood and i would do the test again another 23 minutes it's done i would email them the results the same day and those who wanted vaccination certificates i would issue them based on their results and it was just amazing you know it was easy peasy and it was done and we had such a big good response to it uh i was just telling dr ahn i moved to um the usa thanks to my husband he was um headhunted because he works um he was a he's in cancer research and he's finally an immunopharmacologist and um you know and he was brought over here um by a big pharma and he works in cancer research and now he's working on covet um but for pfizer but um before i moved this was such a big hit this clinic that i vouched that i would go back and do the tighter clinic every few whenever i was in england and i used to travel to england twice a year from the usa to meet my daughter who was studying in law school there and i would ring up this lady we would have a tighter clinic and they would get filled up months in advance and i you know i cannot recollect the exact number of uh times but i'm sure i've done at least um two or three depending on the number of times i went to england per year and sometimes i would do two full clinics of 50 dogs in like two three weeks and it was that was the demand because people believed in it they wanted to know for sure the dogs were immunized and they wanted the certificate so that they need not have their pets unnecessarily re-vaccinated when there was no need for it so this is an example of my most recent um tyler clinic this is in the my current uh i have like a little um clinic in a holistic shop and this was on the 17th not long ago uh on this occasion we i didn't advertise for 24 it was just 12 because i wanted to see how it goes and see that's why i'm saying you can play by ear and decide how many you want to do in a day and it was good and it was smooth then it was fantastic so this is the usa scenario and i would like to share with you my top tips for conducting a successful vaccine tighter clinic you've all heard of vaccine clinics they're very popular in fact there are um huge you know clinics here which just go out and vaccinate all day they just do rabies sometimes they just do dap they're called wellness clinics and they just vaccinate all day and i took the same idea and decided to vaccinate all day so um i usually pick a saturday because that day seems to be the most popular as far as clients wanting to come in i would advertise well in advance you can use email you can use social media you can you know your receptionist can talk about it when people come in and when you send out your annual reminder you can also tell them that there's a tighter clinic uh schedule for this day and they could always book in so that by the time they come in for their annual they can decide if they want to have if they fail the title they could have a vaccine or they could just not need the maxi number just have the full health check and um i usually advertise four weeks in advance and um i leave and if there are spaces i would again re-advertise two days ahead to make sure i fill those spaces and depending on what you want to do like i did 24 in england and here 24 to it sometimes but mostly 12 and i would create a waiting list for no shows so that you would be surprised how much demand there was so we would tell them we'll call you if we get a space um you must be thinking why is she harping about uh multiples of 12 it's because i told you the kit comes in a pack of 12. so you can do 12 tests in 23 minutes and you can do it so it comes in boxes of 12 and i like uh to finish the whole kit on that day because it saves me having to you know store them plate uh plate separately and then cut and all this business so anyway so that's why i work in 12s and i think that's the most um sensible way to do it but you know if it doesn't fill up you can always cut away and store the unused part and use just the whatever numbers you need to do for the day then i would obtain a vaccination history so they i would they would have like a little paper that they have to sign off where they would tell me when the dog was last vaccinated they would also show uh i would also ask them has your dog ever had a bleeding disorder or any problems when they took blood you'll be surprised some of the people who turn up for these clinics are people whose dogs have never been to a veterinarian they have never had a vaccine they have never been ill and you know it's amazing that you see these first timers and you have to ask these questions because what if you know you're taking blood and this animal has a bad reaction so you should have you know some sort of safety but i have to admit i've done about what hundreds and i've never had a single case that was with any sort of disorder or didn't have any problems they also have to give consent for me to run the test so i make sure they sign because america is a very litigious society and i always like to cover myself they've always they've already been explained what this whole clinic is about in advance so they know what they're in for so it's me and one vet tech or it can be two vet techs but with me it's just me and a technician or a nurse i give them five minutes to ten minute appointments so to draw blood because sometimes you can have a fractious animal because of covid they had to wait outside and i just had my technician went and got the animal in i drew blood numbered the tube it's ready to go and once uh i had all the 12 ready or all the 24 ready depending on where i was doing it i was ready to test it this is important you have to price it right now a lot of times you'll have clients asking why am i paying for a uh so much whatever money for a tighter test when i could get a vaccine uh for a lot less you have to explain to them something like this like i say i give this example uh the the medication for hyperthyroidism for example methymizole or felimsole is very very uh cost cheap but the test for hyperthyroidism is expensive this is basically a test it's not a product this if you can explain this difference to them and you can explain um how important it is to actually know if your pet has antibodies they are fine with it you know and some of them um came to me because they said their tighter tests in other places were a lot more expensive so how do you make sure your price is right you have to phone around so i got my practice manager to ring around and she checked for me what people were charging for tighter testing and i picked the lowest price or you can pick in between whatever works for you and then i keep telling them that the biggest advantage is that you provide test results on the same day which you know gives them that time to go back and then book in for a vaccine if their test by chance fail the tighter testing for the core vaccines i also did something else i would tell them that if their pet failed the tighter test i would offer them a discounted vaccine so as veterinarians we all know that vaccines don't actually the actual vaccine doesn't cost much what we charge for should be the annual health check your expertise in examining every part of the animal the actual vaccine cost is fractional you we can well afford to give them a low vaccine at a discounted price if god forbid their dog fails the uh tighter test which does happen uh now i wasn't going to show this slide but a lot of people um vets i have met when i talked to them about are too intimidating always worried about expense they keep saying oh my god i'm going to lose out a lot of money if i don't vaccinate animals every year and i keep telling them it's not the case this is just an idea of what i have made in the past it might not happen every time and this is definitely based on the current situation in new jersey and it's in dollars so i usually order two maxi check test packs from my supplier and two packs of 12 would probably cost me about that much obviously if i buy like a 100 pack it will be a lot cheaper but i'm just saying when you start off do small so maybe go for 12 and just order one pack and see how you get on here this is the price for a vet technician or your or whoever is helping you restrain the dog and this is going by average you know some texts this is all um how shall i say it varies for each one of you your situation is different what you pay a technician is different everything but i'm just giving you a ballpark of what i did and then in my in this case that was me so obviously i paid myself i would end up making a lot more profit but if you were doing it with just one vet and a tech i think a veterinarian is important in case there are issues and also because i would like the veterinarian to run the test unless they're 100 confident that the technician knows it very well in which case a technician could do it and then you can be there to certify and to read the results and reconfirm that you know that this result is accurate and um this is what so let's look at it so this is for four hours and let's say your expenses came up to 860.62 cents for the day and this is what i charged for the tighter test per dog that was about 120 you might say oh that's a lot i am telling you i shopped around and there were people whose tighter test price was 180 those if you had to send it off for a virus neutralization test or a hemoglobin hemagglutination inhibition test to a you know to do the gold standard test in a laboratory it would cost you that much easily and you might say oh well that's a much better test it there is proof there is a paper i can show you which clearly says that the maxi check result is as good as the gold standard so you don't have to worry it does work and because of that you can reduce the cost to the client so i only charged 120. and you'd be surprised the people who came to the tata clinic said i said why did you i always ask them why have you come to me and they say oh you're a lot cheaper than so many other people and i was surprised and that was the truth because there are people who are charging a lot more and then if you look at my expenses just do your math and there you go just the profit from that one day or i would say four hours it's like two thousand dollars right and which i think is uh another it let me put it like this you know you know we have to we have bills to pay and we have to worry about costs and i don't see how you can lose out on running a tita clinic it's unless you haven't advertised probably ended up with two people showing up maybe but then you just pack up and leave so what i'm trying to say to you is that you do not lose income in fact it can be a profitable venture too apart from the satisfaction that you've practiced evidence-based medicine so here we go so it's a win-win situation as far as i'm concerned for everybody for the pet they benefit from a reduced vaccine load plus we are confirming that they are immunized and protected so we have this is the important part remember vaccination is not equal to immunization okay the next thing the pet owners do benefit from a better price as compared to a reference lab tighter test at least it'll be 50 less and if you don't mind taking a cut further you can make it cheaper as cheap or as expensive as you like i like to go always go on the lower side because i want more people to benefit because i'm passionate about tighter testing i'm passionate about not over vaccinating so i always price it just right and um that's what i do i also explained to them that if i had to do an individual test it would take me 23 minutes as opposed to doing 20 12 tests in 23 minutes so i would charge them a little extra if i had to do it just just do one test for a person and they understand that too and as far as our our our welfare as a veterinarian goes or our revenue goes i find this time saving because and it's a good revenue for the amount of time you'd actually be spending in fact if you have a very good nurse who can draw the blood and everything it's only going to take you 23 minutes and then you know signing some paperwork to do 12 tests same same time as it would cost uh as the uh as the effort or the time to take you to do you know one test so i see it as a big win-win for everybody which is why i absolutely love running these tighter clinics finally look at all these people they are key uh you know opinion leaders in the world and they all endorse vaccine check um these are these especially dr professor ronald schultz from the university of wisconsin and professor richard ford from north carol carolina state university they've written some amazing they've done some amazing work and i've read all through the research papers and the evidence is there there's no doubt about it and then look at their comments like um see what dr fode says antibody tighter testing for core vaccines can be a useful and a very reliable tool to determine if an animal has zero converted after vaccination and to decide if the individual animal needs a re-vaccination so this is basically your indication for tighter testing and then you have uh the wonderful doctor schultz and he says the vaccine is a rapid simple test it's reliable this is the important thing it is reliable because i have double checked it with the vnt or the other tests too um and it's an excellent in-house essay and it's very useful to determine determine if a dog requires additional vaccination i would like to leave you all with this um little slide hippocrates the father of medicine has said the first basic tenet in medicine practicing any kind of medicine is do no harm and tighter testing helps you in two ways tighter testing helps the animal by confirming the immunity ensuring that it's protected at the same time tighter testing reduces any possible harm that could be a result from vaccine overload so i make it a habit to help or at least not harm and i would like all of you to practice evidence-based medicine and do what is right by these wonderful animals who need us to do the right thing by them um thank you very much for being there today and joining me in this presentation thanks again to biogal thanks to dr ahn and everybody for um letting me do this presentation thank you thank you so much dr uh wow what a great presentation that you did and the questions have come pouring in uh we are uh frankly speaking out of time so we're going to just go through two very quick questions and for all of you who have submitted questions we do promise to follow up with you uh in fact this presentation uh will be stored and available for future viewing it was a very high quality presentation and we will be following up as i mentioned with all of the questions that you have submitted we do apologize that we had some difficulties with our poll question that we were going to ask but perhaps we can follow up with each of you and ask you this poll question individually so let me quickly get to uh two questions or points uh one of the questions uh came from maryland and this comes from a veterinary technician named marie she was asking dr satish that she titus her own animals she has a young adult cat that had a low or negative titer for fvr cp they vaccinated that week and she's asking should she tighter test again this year or vaccinate would this determine whether he the cat is a non-responder or if the vaccine had poor immunogenicity um first of all um we need to know if your cat had been vaccinated previously and if your cat had definitely been vaccinated and was still showing a negative result i would say first of all repeat it to be sure that your test is valid and um as far as i'm i'm i think you're talking about the vaccine has she mentioned that doctor on uh she did not mention which test platform she used so to be on the safe side i would give like a four week gap and re-test after the vaccination to be sure that the oh she says she uses antec yeah you can go ahead and retest or you could wait a year and retest if your cat is indoor and again it depends on the lifestyle of your cat i always believe in personalized medicine as far as your cat goes if it's an indoor cat then uh you know you don't have to worry too much about re-vaccinating but if it's going to go outside and there is and you're worried about you know what it could pick up and your dear cat he or she would pick up then i would strongly advise tie the test again to just be sure of what's going on um if you are 100 sure that your vaccine um is ideal it's the modified live vaccine and everything else then it's possible that you know there is an issue with um immunogenicity and you have to be um extra careful as far as the um animal goes but uh there's um nothing wrong in um uh if it's a total negative to do uh uh to to vaccinate and then recheck the title in four weeks that's what i would do great and then very last question because we are about to lose this link folks uh professor richard ford who you referenced as a key opinion leader who's based at north carolina state university dr ford commented that perhaps you might address the significance and interpretation of a negative antibody tests result in the young post initial vaccination series dog versus an adult dog yeah i mean i remember uh reading your paper dr food and you've also talked about uh memory cells and b lymphocytes and how that even if an adult dog tested negative it's fully possible that it has um it is capable of an immune response if it's exposed to the virus so not they don't necessarily need to be re-vaccinated even if they have a negative result whereas in the case of a puppy because it hasn't had that amount of time i would recommend that puppies are re-vaccinated if there is a negative result um and i would recheck the titer to make sure that they are not non-responders or anything else is going on because all these core these diseases do tend to affect puppies more and i would be concerned about them um more than an adult dog which probably if it has been vaccinated at least once in its lifetime is okay because of the memory cells which i'm sure would help in the event of an exposure great well thank you so much dr satish it was a wonderful presentation and for all of the other folks that we were not able to get to your questions we will be following up with you we thank everyone for coming to this bio gal sponsored presentation and we hope that you will all stay safe and healthy and have a happy holiday season thank you thank you very much", "FA1t49xboIM": "when I come into a routine Olli April your entirety

some flour from rise up in monroeville okay we're going to be pressing 10.5 grams of gg4 from gti rhythm okay this stuff is ringing in at 23 thc thca we're going to press it at 180 degrees through 120 micron nut smasher branded bag on my 30 ton crd drip tech rosin press big shout out to crd and i want to give a big shout out to my other uh collaborators and sponsors from operation 1620 to balanced veterans to happy hippie trips vapor galleria you folks have all been fantastic i want to show you this flower i'm going to bring it up to the camera here let you get a nice view of it look at how beautiful that is huh look at that just gorgeous super super crystally okay we're gonna load this up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there hope you're staying warm it is cold as hell out there i don't know where you're at but in pittsburgh it's ridiculous right now uh we're supposed to be getting some worse weather coming up i think tomorrow i think we got another storm front coming in tomorrow so if you haven't gotten to the dispensary yet oh my god look how look at the nice the size of these buds look at this this is not the popcorn we've been used to seeing from a lot of dispensaries lately uh now granted they sometimes sell it cheaper but you know what nothing presses as well as these nice juicy buds they've been rehydrated with hydra stones for two hours so they are ready to go um the smell of this stuff is absolutely intoxicated just by itself uh gg4 is a strain everybody seems to know and love i don't know too many people that have told me hey man i really hate gg4 so this is gonna be fun to press oh okay let's get this nice and put in here make sure you can kind of see what's going on all right we're going to cut the excess off the bag grab some parchment [Music] oh yeah super it might be it might be i did find out with this newer press that you really have to [Music] uh have to put a lot of layers in here because this stuff will seep through at the kind of tonnage you're putting on it now it's got to make kind of a directional pouch here to make sure everything stays inside where you want it to be all right get this in here fold up our bag and put it in the middle of our little pouch right here that summer's right there thing is it isn't going to look real pretty on video because when these plates really close down we're going to lose everything on the video but wait do you see what it looks like when it comes apart again it should be super cool i'm going to move the camera a little bit i'll stay stay where you are give you guys a real good view of what's going on here has some happy trees here in a minute all right bring it right up here [Music] turning green to gold that's what we do here at astr's finest closed not available okay here we go and we're bringing the hammer down see what this stuff does so might be able to get us a little better view here here we go [Music] let's get this camera adjusted here for you a little tighter [Music] there we go [Music] i like that heat soaked in there as i bring up that pressure gently i'm looking for that seepage to start really quick because this is a really nice strain a lot of people are pressed gg4 pressing this at last time i pressed gg4 i pressed it at 200. let's see what it does this time i think it's gonna be [Music] beautiful oh yeah out of love gotta love that smell okay okay relax everything [Music] i like using the phone as a monitor because i can get it real closely until i hit a certain point this is right around the point where you're gonna stop seeing a lot of stuff on the video watch this [Music] just keep bringing the pressure nice and slow and nothing will start to move oh god yeah let's see anything [Music] so [Music] so here that is the sweet spot this might not be the most exciting part of this video but you're really going to love what you see coming off of this thing in a minute i can guarantee you that sure all right big shout out to my friends over at rise of monroeville my family up there hope you guys see this video this is the fire that was purchased at your dispensary today check it out we're gonna open this up here in about 30 more seconds and we're going to see what she's doing oh come on show me what i want to see show me that gold [Music] show [Music] okay oh [Music] what happened all right i'm gonna pull this camera out like ouch back over here all right like opening up a present on christmas day look at that isn't that beautiful [Music] oh look at that looks beautiful yeah it's a happy plant there was no overpressure no blowout came out perfect nice and different so if you want to see it okay do this in two stages i'm gonna grab a slick and deposit it all on here so i can squish it out and show everybody how pretty it is and then we'll put it into a jar we'll weigh it up for you to see what the yield is good nice brand new slick [Music] and make sure there's no cap air which is a hazard in this place all right skip tool my brand of choice when it comes to this type of thing i really like the way they work okay here we go oh look at that look at that consistency so glad i did this at 180. at 200 i think this is shattered up i really do oh [Music] beautiful day this fills the room that beautiful stuff yes sir high quality thc tell me you seen the water boy oh yeah [Music] [Music] just [Music] dude colors color is awesome color is completely what you want to be seeing that beautiful pastel [Music] well you're dealing with a variable plant you know it's different every every batch is a little different every pheno is definitely different you know so you can automate things to a certain degree but it still really takes somebody who knows what they're doing watching what's going on you know if i dress that stuff on there another minute and a half it would have probably shattered up you know that's what i mean it's just a matter of doing it doing it doing it until you kind of do it by instinct on this you know i i don't really like using gauges and stuff like that but uh do you find that maybe indicators produce a little more than sativa they do they do they do yeah as a general rule now the exception to that rule african tie i knew it and and malawi memory loss also for the crime those those are two straight indica or straight sativas that produce and behave like indicas on a press i've never seen anything else like um banana kush from from rhythm is another one that's really really nice and oppressed brownie scalp birthday cake great divide all of those excellent yeah you should check out my database i got a link to it that you know you can it changes as i add new data like when i add this it'll update right now so everybody who has a link can view it you can't change anything on it you can look at it it's only like my fifth dispensary flower press this year well the thing is dude you bring what you need for you you know this is about you i mean i love making it for you but this is about what strain works for you right i think i'm a little snobbish when it comes to me only because this is what i do all the time i don't try to press a lot of stuff under 25 percent for me but for patients hey that's your medicine man i'm going to try to get you the very best of what it will give but when you get below you know 25 the yields start to drop significantly so but this this is really really nice just came up very very nice and here missina is not happy to be excluded from the festivities she is a she wants that hey she wants what she wants when she wants it and that's just how it is with the caliper no she does she's she likes she likes to smelly sticks her nose in my raws and every time every time she gets the chance she gets man oh absolutely well here's the other thing too okay you know look i know you're not supposed to smoke it but most people who who who do flower they they smoke right so you take an eighth home that you just spent 65 bucks on or 60 and you're gonna get if you're lucky three joints or maybe two once out of that eighth okay that to me is half a day's worth of medication at most at most you take that same eight you press it the rosin press and get anywhere near a grammar rosin from it and grandma rosin medicates me to the same level three solid days that's why i do this because you save money and get better medicine because this is nug run not trim this is solventless in its purest form right off right off the plant right into rosin no intermediate work needs to be done single stage to medicine so let's get this kind of gathered up okay i'm gonna try to get this all together there we go now it's gripping oh it's broken now there this is mighty fine medicine okay what i'm gonna do is backlight it so you can really see how nice this really is look at that look how clean that is that is beautiful gg4 gti let's find out what our yield is now shall we because that's what a lot of people are waiting to see what did we get so started off 10.5 let's see what 10.5 turned into okay zeroed out get her in the jar oh 1.573 i'll take it any day thanks for joining me for this video stay safe stay medicated and be good to each other asher's finest on the case", "SZURAztagh0": "well hey everyone welcome to the cannabis technology from OSHA Rob Bailey with me today we've got Eric Polaski the director of marketing at a company called pure pressure we also have been Britton that am i pronouncing your last name correctly yep that's correct then the lead engineer and one of the founders at pure pressure as well so how are you guys doing today doing great we're excited to be here yeah we're yeah present it's AG time okay hi I'm kind of excited about this because I know a little bit about rows and extraction but there's a lot I'd like to know and so I thought we'd start at high level and then just kind of work our way into it and learn a little bit out your business model and what you guys are doing so why don't we start there can we start with just the basics of the process in rasen extraction what exactly is it at a high level yeah so Robin is a really interesting new way of extraction that's become popular over the past couple years and its really accelerating the main reason Rasen is picking up steam and what it is that it's an extraction method that uses no solvents so simply put rosin is the cannabis oil and concentrate that's created when you apply heat and pressure to cannabis product which essentially liquefies and extrudes the trichomes and cannabinoids have the material that you're pressing so you know really it is the most simple extraction method and since there's no solvents involved it's also extremely safe it's something that people can do at home small medium you know boutique businesses have really taken rosin and ran with it you know it's really something that's new and a lot of people are really really interested in Robin because it's a little bit more health friendly you know there's no butane there's no propane it's really one of the purest and most authentic expressions the cannabis plant you know in a concentrated form fascinating so getting into it a little bit what constitutes the perfect extraction when you're when you're trying to do this for rosin what are some of the basics that are involved on doing this yeah so essentially what we're doing is we're using heat to lower the viscosity of the oils within the plant and then we're putting that material inside a filtration bag and then so once those oils are liquefied they're under pressure you know in our case from an air cylinder pressing these two plates together and those liquid oils get forced out of the filtration bag so um you know essentially go ahead no I'm probably saying I got you I hear you oh sorry I thought you say nevermind so once those oils lower viscosity there they become mobile and essentially what we're trying to do is force these oils out of the filtration bag and what's left is you've got useless plant matter inside your filtration bag and then you've got nice high-quality rosin on your parchment paper right outside the filtration bag so as far as you know what's important when you're when you're pressing material well you can press any kind of material you can press flour keys bubble hash sometimes trim although we don't always recommend pressing trim directly we usually recommend to keep that out before you you press it essentially you want well cured fresh material is going to get you the highest quality rosin it's going to improve clarity the terpene content will be the highest in that case and so we like to press nice fresh well cared flour and with a relative humidity around 60% and what that does is when we're when we're liquefying these oils we don't want the plant man to act as a sponge and to soak these oils up so having your flower at a 60% humidity is essentially saturating the flower with moisture so that when those oils liquefy they're hydrophobic and they're they're kind of finding their way out of the bag without being absorbed by the plant material so that's a very important step for pressing flower and then when it comes to Keef and bubble hash the humidity content isn't nearly as important but having good high-quality fresh material is really key and then being able to have really good control over pressure ramping over time you know these are very sensitive materials high oil content and that's where our press accelerates is being able to to start at a low pressure a ramp your way up to a higher pressure and get a full yield without really without sacrificing quality okay you know what I've read about it the process that a word that keeps coming up or a metric is is temperature and the ability control it why why is that so important so temperature is important because as I said we are lowering the viscosity of the oil with heat so the temperature that we press that is going to also directly correlate to the the consistency the texture of the rosin on the output side so if we press with a low temperature we can tend to get a buttery consistency if we increase that so a low temperature would be around you know 140 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and then on the high end we would get up at 220 degrees 230 degrees Fahrenheit and that will get you usually a more Shatter consistency and there's you know this is all based on your starting material so you can have you can have certain flour that's going to change the color and the consistency and same with bubble and keys but in general you can kind of have that butter consistency with lower temperatures and a shattered consistency with higher temperatures what's really important is that you're able to have a good temperature distribution across the entire surface of the heat plate a lot of these low quality presses are going to have a very poor temperature distribution we've measured up to a 90 degree fahrenheit difference across the surface of a plate on a competitor's model and what that means is that you might have an area that's not hot enough to even liquefy the oil so you've got no no rosin coming out of that section of the bag and then you might be burning your material on the other end of the bag so having a really even temperature distribution across your plates is really the only way to have a repeatable consistent process with a high-quality output okay when you mention bags is that far the reason why you guys you use micron bags as part of the extraction process yeah yeah so we used a polyester monofilament mesh that's handmade here in Colorado and we sell for different microns 36 70 to 90 and 115 micron and what that is is just the size of the particle that will let through we use polyester monofilament and there's a lot of all in the industry that use stainless steel or nylon nylon is going to be the the biggest problem that want that material has a really high stretch sometimes up to two three hundred percent stretch where polyester is less than one percent and so when you have a high stretch material on a filtration bag what that means is that your micron rating completely goes out the window because under pressure those openings just stretch stainless-steel bags tend to be woven with a thicker thread they're durable and some people will try to reuse them we find it to be more of a pain than it's worth to reuse a stainless keg and because it was thicker threads you tend to lose more oil in the bag itself because the thickness of the met traps oil in that mesh so polyester for us was a no-brainer it's lower cost than stainless steel it's got the strength and it gets a high yield result without changing your your micron mesh size yeah like other spaces is strain and quality of plant that you will pretty imperative in this process yeah Eric here so this is something that we really preach and you know tell our customers and anyone interested in rosin is that you know quality and quality out it's a very cliche way to put it but that's absolutely where you know Robin fits into the equation for any extraction company or anyone who's interested in doing concentrates rosin tends to be an artisanal great product you know not only are there no solvents but because you're putting it in that mesh bag no micron size however small unless you get you know so small that you won't even use that type of measure it's unbelievably expensive it's not going to filter out any contaminants or any issues like that so what you put in truly is what you get out you can't just blast away powder mildew mold things of that nature so when it comes down to quality we're not just talking about plants that are very resinous like your gorilla glues and your high trichome producing strains we're also talking about you know organic high terpene content cannabis that's going to come out the other end as good or better than the way that it went in so when it comes to quality it's really everything when it comes to rosin and that's why Robin tends to sell for a higher price per gram and the unit cell for more than their equivalent solvent-based competitions because people know that they're getting that really high quality pure product when they're you know consuming rosin gotcha you know it's quite a craft what you guys are doing I mean there's obviously a lot of chemistry but it's a ton of know-how and I'm curious how did you guys get here today was it a lot of it just experienced a trial and error can you speak a little bit about that yeah so this has been my business partner Josh was actually been in the cannabis industry for quite a while I have a machine design background I'm a mechanical engineer and we grew up together so we've been friends forever and he came to me with the problem you know he had a couple rosin presses but he had purchased that just weren't holding up and really weren't getting him the yield that he needed so he came to me and we we built a machine just for the hell of it and we ended up getting six times they yield on our first prototype than we did on either of the machines that he had we thought we were onto something here and we made the next version or iteration of it and it only got better and we started really just taking material from his grow to to start playing with different variables and really dial in what's important here as far as pressure temperature you know size and design of the bag size and design of the plates and we just played with each variable and took a real mind-numbing amount of data and just put it all together and decided do you know this is this is where it makes sense this is how we do it and from there it's it started out seeing seeming very ambiguous and kind of like you said a craft and almost an art and as time goes on and we're learning more and more it's becoming more of a science and we're we're finding very repeatable results with what we do that's great and that's a nice segue into my follow-up question because you guys are known as a pretty unique player in this space and I'm curious what what is unique what is different about you guys standing out from the rest of the competition what why do you get how are you guys able to develop this this reputation in this market yeah great question Eric here there's there's a couple ways that we've built the reputation that we have I think the first one is that you know simply we just have amazing engineering resources at our disposal you know between Ben and our industrial designer who came on Kyle within the past year you know we're really focused on putting out the best products we possibly can I mean making the best rosin press and the best accessories is our number one priority we really want people to have the experience with rosin that they never thought was possible with some of our competitors products so that's the first big thing the other thing is that you know as far as a small industry goes a lot of rosin press companies currently and previously were you know to put it mildly not known for their customer service and you know we have a professional team that understands that customer service is really everything when it comes to making sure that people are happy with their purchase decisions so we've really built a reputation more than anything on providing you know the best rosin presses and accessories out there but also you know we really go out of our way to help our customers it's a small industry and if somebody's not happy word can spread very quickly so we really wanted to keep our reputation as good as it could possibly be within the community and you know after you take enough late night calls and weekend support emails we'll really start to understand that we're serious about what we do and we're serious about their success so you know we are rather nerds it's all we're focused on and we really care about our customers so you know I think that's what really sets us apart more than anything yeah I just echo that with other other companies that we interview and successful businesses that kind of transcends all of them is the ability to be authentic and take more of a partnering nature as opposed to just building a product and shipping off and say there you go so kind of neat to see and I'm curious some peer pressure where what are some of the things to look forward to on the horizon what what is some things you guys are aiming for in the future for the company yeah also a great question I can't give you all the details but early next year we're going to be coming out with an at home level press so currently our two flagship products the Pikes Peak Robin press which is where we really staked our name and then we just released the long speak which is a larger more commercially oriented cousin of the Pikes Peak it's got about 60% more pressure so we're really working on that we actually also just released our press where technology which is a full LCD touchscreen but it's one that we developed in-house we didn't just go out and buy a touchscreen and plug it in it allows you to save recipes and really dial in your process and get repeatable results in a way that no other presses on the market can match and then looking forward into the future you know we're really focused on coming out with an equivalent quality at-home press that's geared towards enthusiasts and small growers and people who want to make Rasen at home but don't want to settle for a cheaper rather than press and are still looking for a high quality product like ours but you know maybe they don't have the funds or the need for a six or seven thousand dollar Robin press like our other are additionally we're also really focused on helping extraction labs get the most out of their equipment by offering full you know lab in a box type kits we already do bubble hash kits sifting you know accessory products but we're really trying to tie that all together so that people can come to us and they can say hey I want to get into rods and what do I need to do and we say here's your turnkey solution we've got everything for you and you know a lot of education would be the thing I would conclude with on our future plans we really work hard to bring a lot of Education and information to an industry that lacks it and that most of the information people gather is on Facebook groups and these random posts and you know it's not a very good way to disseminate information when people are just having conversations here and there so a lot of media efforts are underway to put out as much information as we can you know of course for free just to educate the community and really move the entire industry forward not just selling our products but you know making rasen everything that it could and should be you know as an industry sure what's the biggest misnomer in in rosin extraction what is what is the thing and obstacle you're constantly having to educate folks on if there is one yeah no there there's a couple I'd say the number one thing and we're on the verge of coming out with the pretty in-depth blog post on this is pressure and perhaps heat plate sides because it's what you have many of our competitors presses have very high tonnage our Pikes Peak for example is a five ton press and many of our competitors are 15 20 tons and a lot of people just aren't really sure so they come to us and they say hey why is your press twice as expensive as this other one but it only has a quarter of the pressure tonnage and we have to explain to them that you know in many instances a higher pressure hydraulic cylinder is a much cheaper and less reliable way to apply pressure to your rods and extraction process then the cylinders that we use which are oilless maintenance-free and they're pneumatic which is the key thing they're custom fabricated for us in the US so you know a lot of people think that they need high pressure to get good results which we you know strongly believe simply isn't true and then furthermore heat plate size we get a lot of questions about people saying you know hey I got a a giant heat plate it's the size of a plate what can I do with this but you really need to be conscious of the size and shape especially of your heat plates and we've done a ton of research and information into figuring out pretty much what the optimal size is though more than anything those are the two things people get confused about you know to sum that up that one you don't need nearly as much pressure as a lot of our competitors are saying you do they're just using high pressure hydraulic cylinders because that's the cheap and easy way to create a press and then furthermore you definitely do not need giant square plates because that reduces your yields in many ways it means that the oil has to travel so far from the center of the bag to the perimeter and actually be pushed out that you're wasting a lot of oil that's either getting stuck in the bag it's sitting on the heat for too long and degrading the terpene profile so you know a long narrow heat plate shape is always going to be your best bet those are probably the two questions that we get the most and have to talk through sure I know what makes sense and I'm curious that you guys you've got you've carved out a really niche space a space that you guys are clearly leading in and I'm curious when you guys as this space unfolds what are the challenges and being scalable you know I mean as we know with legislation in the cannabis industry it's quite fluid there are a lot of obstacles what are some of the things that you guys would struggle with as you continue to grow your business successfully yeah scalability is one that we get a lot because rosin as it is is not an extraction method that scales as well as some of the solvent based methods and we've kind of accepted the fact that as time goes on we're working really hard to automate and produce a lot of innovations that make this process a lot less labor-intensive than it is now so we're working in that direction but you know I think rosin is always going to be kind of a small batch type product and for a lot of people that holds cachet you know this isn't your 20,000 bait cartridges a month you know a week produced on a co2 on sheen with you know God knows what material it could be literally anything and now you've just got you know raw oil you know a lot of the other extraction methods you know to put it in a funny way someone told us that you know it's kind of like distillate and co2 is like the hot dogs of concentrates you have really no idea what's in there you know rosin is is pretty much going to be a small batch thing you do have to increase your labor to upscale your size but there's also a ways to increase efficiency like pressing bubble hash or key for sift you can do you know two to three times more in a single press than you can if you're pressing flowers so some of the some of the time harder players out there really pressing a lot of bubble hash and that's you know perhaps the zenith of all concentrates right now you know bubble hash rods and made with fresh frozen materials so there's a little bit of a tangent but you know as far as scalability goes that's what we're really looking to attack in the future that makes a lot of sense well guys this has been a fantastic interview I really appreciate you taking the time could you direct our viewers or listeners if they wanted to dig up more information on peer pressure and and your products where would they go yeah absolutely we are super approachable

excellent thanks thanks for having us all right thanks guys all right [Music] cool with that with", "TddH9LbPH7Y": "[Music] what's good world today we here celebrating black history month my name is damian smith director of black voices and culture for the chamber of cannabis as a brand consultant creative director owner of we are coaches history and cannabis culture entertainment i am thankful and proud to be able to work in a state that's thriving in the cannabis industry today we wanted to recognize black excellence in interviewing some of the most influential leaders here in las vegas in the cannabis industry specifically here in nevada with over 330 licenses only five of them being owned by a black minority or a woman combined that needs to change this legislative session there is no national uniform legal code to ensure that there is social equity in the cannabis market it's not just equity in terms of ownership but equity in terms of the supply chain looking at businesses like hemp media marketing compliance and social use lounges that is why here in las vegas the chamber of cannabis is the only organization working with legislators to ensure social equity when licenses are available let's face it if you don't have a huge hundred million dollar investment to do a cultivation or cannabis dispensary it is important to find and create other ways to get into the cannabis space especially for us minorities and women because we know when licenses go out we know who's getting displaced us greetings fam my name is nicole befong i am director of medical voices for the chamber of cannabis as well as western regional director for minorities for medical marijuana a non-profit whose mission is focused on providing advocacy outreach research and training as it relates to the business social reform and public policy in the cannabis industry it was obvious to me when i moved to nevada two years ago that medical patients did not receive enough benefits medical patients should not have to pay taxes on their medicine pharmaceutical drugs do not have the same taxes why should the plan medical voices in the cannabis industry are vitally important and remind us of why the plant should be available to all patients i am asking all nevada dispensaries and brands to discount your products to medical patients everyone is affected by the pandemic patients should not have to go without their medicine just because they cannot afford it the two groups most impacted by federal rescheduling and consolidation of the industry will be women and minority owned businesses the average wealth of black families is almost seven times lesser than the average wealth of white families making it harder for them to raise capital blessings in love it's christina thomas director of veterans voices for the chamber of cannabis i am a wife a mother a patient a veteran a wellness instructor and a small business owner many of you don't know that less than seven percent of our population is comprised of veterans veterans make up a small amount of our population and they carry some of the most complex physical and mental conditions because veterans are two times more likely to accidentally overdose and with over 9 million veterans being served at the va hospitals it is necessary that we give our veterans an opportunity to choose their care thankfully with the more act being passed through congress and now waiting for senate we can have some hope that that actually will happen being a leader in one of the fastest growing markets here in nevada of one of the only black owned cultivations means to me that i'm part of the one percent that nevada neglected to ensure had an opportunity in this industry as co-founder of ceic our cores are freedom equity and opportunities um our core values are we want to see our people free so this bill um represents bdr 360 represents our first core of freedom to be a black leader in a successful dispensary in las vegas is empowering it's fulfilling and it's exciting it also gives me the opportunity to give other black leaders the opportunity to become a part of the cannabis experience my name is porsche davis and i am the admin retail here at oasis canada i would like to see our political leaders change the laws from just being a state law to a federal law this should be something that is allowed in every state at this point we have it in some states we should have it in all states it should also be a step forward in allowing people who have been in prison or in jail in federal jail i'm doing the same thing that they're doing every day i'm getting paid to do the same thing they're doing every day and it would be like i don't know it'll just be the greatest thing that could happen to black people minorities and the world itself my current favorite cannabis product is going to be the spiked apple cider from city trees it is very flavorful it also has wonderful terpene profile as well and then i also am in favor of the gop grapefruit bread that one is just amazing it's organic it's fresh it's always ready to go it's sticky it rolls well and it smokes good my name is xavier stokes i'm the general manager of medicine subsidy area planet 13 holdings i've actually gotten the industry in 2017 been in it about three four years now um started from blood tender to trainer and now general manager uh what it means to me to be a leader and one of the most successful dispensaries and one of the largest markets in america is honestly as a source of opportunity and inspiration for people who want to get to my position it is very gratifying there's also a lot of hard work and it's something that i try to get to on a daily basis what advice i would give to people who are starting as a blood tender and trying to get to my position is dedicated work ethic there's a lot of times where you might be looking for gratification or rewards and you have to use that self drive right that goal that you give yourself that carrot so to speak to strive and get more it's not always going to be in the form of tangible results but it will pay off in the end for me to represent for my culture and the people who are affected by the war on drugs and things that have happened in the past it is honestly a reversal of stigma for me i'm trying to set a tone as far as what is allowed and what's acceptable some of my favorite cannabis products usually i'm a flower guy so i gotta go with some of the medicine like we just got our batch out runting it's very it's very unique to the runt strains sometimes you try a new strain in a new market and it doesn't remind you of what it originally was right my master grower and vice president of operations here chris wren does a really good job of maintaining the actual culture and also maintaining the identity of strings so that's where i got to start and then secondly i like concentrates and edibles some of my goals that i want to do next in the cannabis space directly reflect what the chamber of cannabis has going on right now to push social use and also push the social equity right that you can generate from just a lot more people into the space i want there to be somebody out there who looks like me but maybe a little bit terrified or unsure of how they can get into the game and know that it's possible you", "ELx2uzFSGMg": "[Music] so it's some random moles it's animal cookies and you said grape grape grape grape I'm sorry yeah and it's super fresh super fresh that's the grranimals this cannabis is grown organic from Mendocino its finest cannabis tissue culture so this started off in the petri dish and I grew it and I vege to it and i gave it love and love and love and I cut it down perfectly and this is where I'm at right now and this is some of the finest product I have I grew up with 22 transits here I'm down to six strands and it's all small batch craft cannabis Organic hippie cannabis yes we're doing a living soil we do the we do pots we do we love what we do we do it's it's it's it's it's just my heart my heart and my soul but yeah this this stuff right here is is unreal it's unreal [Applause] we're good we're actually we do all over California so I'm I'm spontaneous about where I'm at I go to Sacramento I go to San Bernardino I go to Oakland I go everywhere and actually I'm on my way to catering weddings that's my goal to have a dab bar and pre-roll for my for weddings in wine country stupid good for animals around here nobody has that right now Trish nobody has happy it's from the real Coronado in Colorado he's the guy that made it I'm the one that grew it though and then I hear we've got some prepared and my own proprietary preparation method a lot of companies will do BTS or bottle textile this is a variation on that it's a little more efficient it's a top bottle and this is a let's see 90 micron bag courtesy of the Press Club so far they are my favorite company in terms of bags you can press bagless but only really small amounts and it tends to not be as clean you slap particulate in there so I like going with bags and we'll see how it comes out right now I'm also pressing this at a lower temp at 185 yes correct this is a DIY Robert uh-huh correct and using dab press plates on here shout out to them too there are another really great company you can go with a build that's much more do-it-yourself than this but I still had to come up with something that was that fit my own style and budget compared to other companies that are out there there are some great players in the rosin press market our industry but a lot of the presses out there are pretty pricey for the average you know Joe Schmo who's just starting wanting to press a little bit see how it goes not everyone's got a thousand bucks to spend on experimenting you know for bud right but these these machines I have two of them they costs way less than that to build so I'm all about the DIY and trying to empower empower the average you know the average guy or gal gonna push it in a little bit further preparation is key I am kind of fiddling with it yeah this one's hand but you could go with electric with a palm plus I talked about like the art of pressing a lot of it you using your senses your going by what you see what you hear some people it's been allowed here but some people listen for a sizzle I like using my eyes once you see the oil starts trick draining out that's usually when I start my time as well if you look online or if you ask somebody who presses they will give you they'll have a long explanation about the best temperature the best time to leave it in for me it's preferential it depends on what I'm pressing right now I'm at 185 which is not the lowest some people press that like 170 but I think the 80s are pretty good for for getting a nice butter and preserving a lot of Terps but also getting a good yield well I mean a lot of people press button like the low 200s yeah yeah the usually arranged is 170 F to about 220 but if you go into the 200s even though you end up getting a nice yield you you've sort of burnt off or destroyed some of the Turks so it tends to come out a lot darker and since there's less Terps it's not really wet or saucy it's more like shattered I tend to prefer the batter's it's got more flavor so when I start seeing a lot seeping out that's usually when I start my time but again I kind of play it by eye and by ear if I'm going to and-a-half minutes if my time runs out and it's still flowing out a lot I'll put an extra minute maybe if I hear it's still sizzling meaning there's still oil sort of boiling out of the plant matter then I know there's a little more and I'll leave it a bit longer so in terms of different cultivars and how they yield once we finish this you kind of tell me how this how this Street does yeah yeah fair enough well this has a little bit longer to go so in the meantime let me just show you something you can see there speaking of other cultivars these are some other presses I've done recently this here is purple tangi which it was from stay high LAX I don't believe they cultivated it but it was just some really nice but it's just a team of dominant hybrid this one buttered up on the paper so it's completely stable you can touch it it's not sticky at all it just smells like a fruit basket just punches you in the nose this is from Josh wax this is his Seabiscuit a3 which I think has won some competitions of its own actually this was just pressed let's see two days ago and left to cure for a little bit completely buttered up just extremely fragrant pressed at a low temp and and then on the other end of the spectrum I for personal use I press a lot ahem so these are hemp Rosen's high CBD roses so these give you a lot of anti-anxiety and cyah lytic relief anti-inflammatory relief so it's going to help a lot of pain you might have from old injuries or arthritis or whatever you have some people find it helps them sleep better or recover from workouts faster for me honestly it just helps with anxiety and and muscle pain I have back pain so scoliosis so this one's almost ready and I could just tell by how it looks it's starting to butter up already see that frothiness once I take it out and get it on the cold plate its gonna butter up and that's our time trying to dry this off make sure there's no condensation this is a budget cold plate this is a this is a baking tin and you know just a quick yeah it's like 10 bucks compared to a professional cold plate which is like 8200 so yeah we don't have smell-o-vision but not yeah right you know when smellivision finally comes around it's going to be stoners who really make the most use out of it I wanted AB do it these guys are hot we also got some courts if as long as someone's got a torch I don't have a mount of beauty there on the court should be the best guys are hot already though or if someone's got a puff CO or something yeah here let's I was gonna do I was gonna do a second press and so I could really track the weight do you mind I'll be quick that's cool area I want you guys to smoke on this later - okay okay this is my head size so definitely get in there oh yeah it's all you guys follow my Instagram as far as I'm concerned though this press very nicely my Grand Canyon cannabis well I could have got some cheaper stuff but this is my favorite also oh that's all that looks nice that's a big yield for flower yeah and this is just the first press Wow you said it was six fiction - six point four that gives me a canon boner if I find my gelato 45 hash it's over it's over yeah my my bubble hashas dabble bowl so if you hit it on a high heat you get dad's all day yeah put love into it man hey they've no they pressed my or grranimals my month my head stash hi he said six point four and I'm thinking total will be about one and a half usually four grams of pretty good bud or 25% brings back a gram of rosin because the weight is about a quarter gram per per gram of flour and that's assuming we can extract a hundred percent of it and realistically I'm getting in the 90s when you're done pressing you typically end up with these called rosin chips some people will break the weed out and try to smoke it but I wouldn't recommend that because it's very harsh and it doesn't have that much in it so it's you know it's you're gonna be smoking a lot for the effect you'll get what I picture exactly you could soak it in alcohol a high high proof like Everclear of vodka or I actually make it in coconut oil I cook it or you can do butter and there you have animals in oil but my point is there's no waste at least with the way I do it so this is the second one it's I don't usually leave them for as long because it's already hot it has a heat from the first round I just want to quickly push out whatever didn't come out the first time and then again here's the strain oh look look at that [Music] [Applause] it's like diamonds [Applause] okay I'll let this out and again you can make presses or there are presses that are much more compact than this for six tons of pressure but a lot of them are very very costly or just just not as DIY I guess is this one yeah that's the most pretty good so the second presses are usually darker a little oilier in some cases you start burning the oil and that's why it's darker but I'm going at a pretty low temp so I think this is just getting to the limits of the oil in this amount of weed eventually if you keep cranking you'll get a really dark oil and that's actually not even cannabinoids anymore that's like chlorophyll and you're getting plant oils that you don't really want yeah the good stuff tends to come out in the first two presses and that's what we've got here beyond that you're you're getting out stuff you don't really want to be smoking it's gonna make it hard yeah these are some presses I did right before you got here I showed you this one but you could kind of see it this is from some ahem so it's got a much more glassy shatter kind of look to it usually hemp by press at a higher temp so I can get a better yield out of it I'm I got a lot the first time yeah I'm in a way it right now I know this is another hemp strain on other one was super haze and this is a lifter Oh Jeep so those are the presses I've done tonight like I said for myself I do a lot of CBD pressing CBD rasa if you don't have a cold surface the scrape is really tedious and really annoying you really want to use a cold surface if you're at home obviously something like the freezer or you know maybe put a plate in the freezer for a second to get cold I like using the little entryway to the freezer there's usually going to be a nice little flat platform depending on how your doors open if they open out sideways or they have the vertical stack ones but point is you need a cold surface granite countertop can work pretty well too and I'm leaving behind these little plant bits because obviously we don't want those on the nail this one yeah look at that and when it's really high quality bud a lot of times you can mix the person the second press for some people it is preferential but what I found is if they're done close together same temperature it'll all mix together pretty well and it will all butter up together but I know some companies out there they definitely don't mix their first and second runs for flour rosin I think it's okay maybe for hash rosin you wanna you want to keep that first and second press or run separately when it's this buttery I also try to not disturb that too much I'm not not I want the butteriness to be I want you to be able to dab that up there you go look how easy that comes up Oh this is it as a letter peace latter peace yeah look at the color though you cut me a little square one of these from now and maybe thank you I had another square a second ago thank you all right so all this in 6.2 6.4 this feels like a little over a gram and a half based on 6.2 or 6.4 if it's 25% we should get about one and a half or so so let's see okay a little under one and a half but that's let's see I'm pleased about the quality [Applause] so you said 6.4 okay my bad 21% that's not bad as long as you're in the 20s I think you're good but I can do better I have done better before but but in terms of the color and the quality sorry guys aren't coyotes or anything yeah look at that yeah yeah well here you are sir I uh let me give you like a jar of something but I ran out but I'll get some more in a second for my buddy and then you can try some out the car club so have you ever impressed us honor now brand-new I just got I just harvested I'm super excited all right let's do this [Music] tastes like raisin bran oh my god thank you one love oh I'm in pain but it's a good thing you heard of bigging it's like digging in my throat wow it's awesome you guys are awesome I love the [ __ ] energy you guys are great", "r9kbCMUJQ6Q": "so we're here at Leatherwood bespoke rasa and this is in papers don't tell us about it tell us how this happened how did this happened I was a violinist with frustrated rosin experiences yes and I wanted to you know improve the experience of myself so not only the design the sort of the shape but also the quality the materials used like the Australian timber and their deer leather trap here but also just make recipes that really made a big difference to the sound response and what what do you do in a recipe that makes it different what [Music] brighter and more powerful sounding and some that are really warm and rich and also you know various flavours in between we can also make drop recipes and recipes for electric instruments and that's just what tree they come from or what yeah and also the way it's been distilled okay and what trees cannon that can they come from Theresa oh yeah mine Theresa look a little March another variety said of it to make this use to yes okay very cool nice to talk with you yeah", "PXvwzsZ2Reo": "with woody from up coffee carry extracts one of my favorite extracts when I'm here in Colorado so what's so special about your lab in the extra so one thing that's unique about apothecary extracts is we're vertically integrated we grow all of our cannabis here in-house and most of it is actually sold out of our dispensary locations we have three locations in Colorado Pueblo Colorado Springs and Denver awesome yeah I went to the Broadway one last night and got some fire yeah let's go check it out so we have how many plants we got the building here James this is one of three cultivation sites that we operate we're gonna go check out the bedroom so this is the badging room right here wow this is nicely set up yeah one thing you'll notice is the environment here it feels really it's almost almost a perfect environment oh yeah perfect each room changes its own hair so you can see three different scales of production all the plants that you see over there on the left are getting ready to flip over into flower here within the next week so that's how high we it's awesome some unique strains that we grow here the Tropicana cookies the jam band our in-house project the raspberry lychee who we also have blackberry banana Kush lemon GE one of my favorite new strains classic we grab the star dog Death Valley cheese the blue lemon tie among a few other streams you got it going on right now well I was I did a live feed on the way here and I talked about I could see that you you and your team really care about the product what you present to the people his highest standards you know absolutely you know one thing that you will find is all of our you know the higher ups at apothecary are true connoisseurs and passionate about the product really passionate about cannabis concentrates and we do everything in our power to put out a really clean Heitor bean extract awesome let's check out some more stuff they extracted out sorry it's funny this is the starter he runs the squash op this is our solving this extractor awesome so maybe we can get him on policy got a nice little present yeah yeah peer pressure but he's getting ready to do some pressure you get some bottle and I can show so what happened looks almost empty now we actually just moved into a new facility Friday is our new Pueblo map this will it will still be an operation that we may end up doing something at this facility but really all of our operations will be down look at this but now this is a bubble ash well boats training to look around for all got to get my nose on this we all need are these looking out beautiful but my quantity - one is 777 he said he might come yeah it said and then when they press this oh my gosh fire and then when they put it into one of these in the back oh you get some diamonds from this diners philosophy but you can actually die map dot - that's how fine it is we got some stuff here right now what's the average time you leave stuff in the back depends on like if you want to make really nice diamonds oh so like if you would make really large diamonds you know three weeks plus but for just a basic crystallization I mean these guys can crash on a jar overnight I want to show you this is some of us it's that pressure still no some raspberry cheek batter ooh what was some rosin look at this rosin here that's the and you know as saltless is becoming more and more in demand that's all the Salinger's one thing flower refreshment work one thing I really like about someone's fashion you can't line up supplements okay witness hydrocarbons don't even really clean up an extract that's absolutely you know poisons and sprays you know just a really deficient plant and and you can clean it up so nobody knows that is the diffusion length with rosin you can't you know you don't have a great product you're not going to make your awesome or it's going to be something that's so undesirable nobody wants to smell bad it tells me that it takes my bark to speak of looking at on the right point nine percent THC a 99.999 point but 99.99999 point THC a right there that's a big jar guys I'll nobody can see how much is in there because it's so white but there's what so now which one are you getting ready right now what is this Sarah diesel so the sour do you said that we just looked at those 25 25 micron well it's different Mike but now can you explain the difference on Mike grunts real quick the smaller size is what you learned yet and why are you different sizes that sometimes each side smell is broken down to a different granules and holes usually secondly is the most impressed I was working is we're really just going to go weekend and now you want to even write you do you don't want no gaps or anything why is it that you don't want to gaps in there so that way whenever you squish it out it's all messed up even so everything awesome thank you it's free to go with us yeah oh man look at all this stuff working yes it this is all bubble hash in your people what else we got here you have anything besides these are a raspberry Gucci right more raspberry lychee that's a East Coast sour D cross at the blackberry cush Wow grown and bred in house a type object it's a real angel oh wow that does that mean Wow and that's the things like you know watch it took me a newt it even creates tips up to absolutely different Turkey yeah in mind you don't get that true expression until it gets pressed yep you know what I mean you know the strain could have very little smell in bubble hash form and then when it's finally pressed out it's just as loud as ever so much repressed sometimes or it's high in goes I are right because that truther people we're going to move on to the production facility where everything gets packaged graham set out so here we are in the packaging area of apothecary extract so this is some jamman that we are getting ready to draw at the various facilities oh that is so means this Jamaican skunk crossed with the headband yeah all saw the was nice she's got a very very unique oh so that's actually so that's the higher micron yeah so check that out yeah rosin is just getting turf here and better to love the science behind it I just you know what I was I said I've been in two decades I dreamed it you go like this but I never dreamed that it would go yeah so yes so all of our all of our saltless is in this essentially woodgrain lid just as a way to differentiate between our Soliman hydrocarbon your high quality stuff ended up absolutely laughs the shadow games rings laughs a shot yeah it's getting ready to you like it looks like you're like a kitchen actually I can't kitchen kitchen cooking but it's not you all chatter yeah let me show you what we got here all proper and I Turkey everything we do is about preserving the Turks there's our bubble hash makers right there 15:28 packagers know what does the average pakistani do - how many do pack a day ground on a lot and they needed 600 40s live version last month I think we grabbed out just medically it was like 53 thousand grams and then in inch on average a you guys back all the coastal up for house was full of other your batter is is on point even your dogs are your batter by that batter is like oh my god and that's a cat see Bubba purple punch across a new strain that we have here at apothecary", "RR57B-ZTQ3A": "I used to show a photograph before I would talk of me with the stethoscope on just to say I really do practice medicine much of what I'm gonna talk about it's gonna sound more like I should be running a spa as opposed to you know practicing medicine but I'm gonna explain to you and hopefully give you enough evidence and background as to why a foundation of optimal health that is individualized and not generalized to a patient is really fundamental not only for preventing disease but actually for treating disease and actually I would argue the worse the disease the more important it is not the other way around just for disclosures I'm clearly biased there's no question about it for 35 years my wife and I have focused on developing a model for cancer care really much because both of us had a number of cancer patients in the family as you know when we worry much younger this is our staff we run a kind of a you know small operation about 20 clinicians all involved between physicians medical oncologists nurse practitioners physician assistants and then a whole slew of specialists and what I would call integrative care this is what's going on we're right now in 2012 of 19 million people with cancer globally a year and by the year 2025 not even 35 we will be at 25 million American people on the planet with you know new cancers per year with about 15 million of them dying annually now this is a little early and it's not completely fair what I'm about to say but this was New York Times publication of some national center health statistics and it showed what we all know that cardiac disease dropped in that 55 year window from 1950 to 2005 by 64% and that was really an education of the public that was done by the medical world it was impressive it was knockout during that same exact window of time our mortality change in cancer was barely audible it was less than 5% now there's a number of reasons why the war on cancer hasn't been you know successful and and one of them is is our system still is topsy-turvy we focus on disease care and health as an afterthought we don't really focus on health as a foundation and I hope to make the argument today pretty clearly that that foundation is sorely lacking and a very big reason why we haven't had the success that we could have and we know that cancer is not about one track but rather in interconnected growth highways and that we can't shut down all of these highways it's a little bit like whack-a-mole the cancer has the ability to change tracks and I'll show you some of that today and to be able to shut down those different tracks we need a bit different model that drugs alone would be too costly and too toxic to be used in multiple at the same time and I love the cancer stem cells story because it kind of rings true to my childhood I actually grew up in South Florida now during the Cuban Missile Crisis and I used to tell my you know parents all the time my father was in politics and a lawyer and my mother was in real estate and I said you know they're gonna blow us up they're gonna kill my dog but these dang palmetto bugs these roaches they'll survive anything and it turns out by the way that these cancers themselves do exactly like that three to five percent of all cancers are made up of these stem cells and so far our approved therapies don't touch it and we know it's a major reason for replicative immortality and regrowth of disease I don't do alternative medicine in fact as William Duff T Gloria Swanson's sixth husband calls himself William the sixth he basically said you are in an alternative to alternative medicine and I would actually agree with that I really believe in conventional medicine as a foundation of care I just don't think we go far enough so I don't believe in lieu of me stream I really you know it's a rule not so favorable complementary medicine is really mostly for research purposes it's single intervention you know strategies breast cancer with yoga is what the studies look like prostate cancer with green tea I don't believe that these single interventions are going to do much even if they show a little bit of data in terms of quality of life maybe a little bit improvement it won't be enough to pay much attention to my book and our focus has been a systematic model to address systemic disease that is comprehensive multi interventional whole systems approach with treatment strategies that are individualized based on objective assessments and provided with a life affirming communication between patient and doctor and it's a much broader kind of model of thinking about medicine and all good medicine should really be that now that I say something really kind of wild particularly if there's a you know any on colleges in the rooms people don't die from cancer it's a myth people die from complications associated with the disease or with treatment and those complications actually are often enough preventable if we get patients in super shape regardless of their disease we all have these symptoms fatigue insomnia bowel problems etc they affect us if you're a cancer patient particularly in terms of biochemical disruption clinical complications treatment side effects interference and that can lead to recurrence progression and life-threatening complications that take patients off the planet if I take that one step further right I can now start talking about well integrative care there is research to show it will block every one of these in some aspect there's research to show that I'm going to just focus on treatment side effects just to show you that thus if you believe that a foundation of Health and that a patient's performance status which we all you know grade in every single patient that we see is directly correlated to their survival and work goes back to the 50s 60s and 70s that completely corroborates that still today eh then it's hard to ignore the fact that addressing a regimen that improves diet fitness stress care sleep as a foundation couldn't improve overall outcome with patients now our the model I'm going to talk about addresses three major areas this is the first area we talked about in terms of this terrain or soup biochemical environment and we intervene with nutrition physical care circadian health bio behavioral we look at this second area biochemical environment the the extracellular soup that these cells grow in and that's things like oxidation inflammation glycaemia the immune functioning stress chemistry coagulopathy which I'll come back to and what are really today probably more growth tracts and you know molecular genomic promotion of disease and proliferation apoptosis resistance angiogenesis the dissemination of disease and metastasis in this regard these are the different hallmarks that we came up with in terms of strategy there's an eleventh one here called the micro environment and I'm going to talk about these briefly and these are therapies already that exists in terms of conventional drugs to address each and every one of these hallmarks so I broke this down as metabolic hallmarks or what I refer to as the super terrain before the metabolic and biochemical environment genomic instability and chronic inflammation are your enablers of cancer dysregulated metabolism is glycaemia insulin emia things that are more mitogenic as opposed to mutagenic growth stimulating and immune evasion the dysregulated new system is really the last defense to cancer and then molecular harm arcs in terms of instead of you know really metabolic molecular sustained proliferation or because of mutation your cancer from the membrane of the cell gets a message from each train station along the way leading to the nucleus to tell the DNA to replicate and you this simple message that says instead of as a normal cell grow grow grow you have a glitch in the system that starts saying grow grow grow grow grow grow kind of a meat machine-gunning of disease and this is sustained proliferation and then the ineffectiveness of the brakes of the stop signal there's the tumor microenvironment that's these cells right alongside the edge of the tumor that leads to sprouting like angiogenesis and we know in all wars that if you cut off the supply lines to the army that you're fighting against and they can't eat or drink you don't have to fight them at all you just have to wait it out right and so that's true for cancer as well and then this is your really last set of steps in terms of cancer is immune dysregulation a terrain factor of coagulopathy and invasion of metastasis there are several reasons I mentioned cancer stem cells and their ability to bring a cancer back over and over but if you think of a soccer ball and you think of bb's filling that entire soccer ball and you think of eight different colors of the bb's being painted one of eight colors and you come in with a pesticide or whatever chemical a chemo and you knock out as they're designed to do one drug one target and you knock out one color what happens is cancers just fill in the spaces it's just like a garden with weeds you use a pesticide and then the other weeds fill it in really quite rapidly so this is a gentleman came to us actually a minister that was under my care for seven years with renal cancer with six organ sites involved besides the kidneys he's a cattle farmer in Colorado it's 1990 and he's told that he has a year to live and nothing could be done for him he's got lung and lymph metastases he changed his cattle farm to organic vegetables I like to say he traded carrots cattle for carrots kind of a cute story but really the more impressive story about this guy is not only he did a full program with us did interferon but not you know particularly all that promising a therapy or strategy for him and we completely cleared him of lung and lymph metastases from the kidney this is a woman diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer bone and left metastasis 1983 she was told by the surgeons they got it all she was sent home with no plan I see her at a recurrence point a couple years later she's free of disease she was a chemist lives in downtown Chicago now retired with grandkids this is kind of individualizing care nutritional assessments that we do we do body composition analysis when we look in surveys of what the patients have been eating and not eating we do all kinds of testing of strength flexibility aerobic capacity body composition analysis Rex that rest activity cycling in terms of circadian health and what we know is just wild in terms of cost of health and eating is that the cheaper the food the higher its energy concentration or density so calorically fat wise etc actually we package this stuff and it's cheaper than buying fruits and vegetables and whole grains and legumes just dried foods that you know could supply the whole worth of the whole earth in terms of food nutritional needs kind of a little wild this is what the ACS's guidelines are in terms of nutrition and cancer prevention achieve and maintain a healthy weight throughout your life stay lean and get regular physical activity and limit high caloric intake this is suggesting 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 of vigorous exercise and if your kid you should be getting about an hour a day this is kind of the story and it's the same exact type of studies that you see in cardiac disease this is a typical Western diet eaten by most Americans red meat you all heard about the latest with processed meats no surprise to some of us butter dairy high-fat dairy a sedentary lifestyle and refined grains and you can see in terms of breast cancer about a 20% increase there are good carbs and there are not so good carbs and anybody tells you that all carbs are bad which is kind of popping out of the latest pop diet almost by them two months or month a new you know one comes on the marketplace has not read any of the literature about glycaemia and insulin II me and everything else that complex carbs and legumes actually stabilize sugar levels so let's switch to fats and say there are good fats and not-so-good fats and I know everybody gets off on grass-fed beef and all of this but let me tell you that your omega sixes and your saturated fats are pro-inflammatory and pro oxidative so they will actually drive disease alright our regiment is a rainbow of vegetables whole cereal grains and I mean whole brown rice barley oats I don't mean flour plant-based proteins legumes beans soy seeds nuts some cold water fish eggs preferably omega-3 if you're gonna use the yolks egg whites fine fruits and berries limiting your quantity of fats and getting better quality of fats deep-sea fish seeds nuts avocado walnuts sesame flax olive substituting dairy alternatives I'm and milk soy milk rice milk etc and supplementing with whole plant green drinks okay I'm gonna switch to exercise quickly and just say that in all of the exercises I don't care who brass : kidney you know prostate in all cases the subjects that have higher exercise did better with less progression and less mortality now just two quick studies breast cancer patients that exercise 3 to 5 hours per week even speed walking a stationary bike what have you cut mortality by half annually and colon cancer patients that did 6 to 9 hours per week cut mortality by 61% and recurrence by more than half so let me just briefly talk about this last section the question we were asking was does antioxidants when given concurrently with chemotherapy decreased efficacy or prevent cancer cells from cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy or does it increase efficacy reduce toxicity and protect normal tissue and I'm just summarizing an enormous of how to work in two papers at the same time first one was published in 2007 cancer treatment reviews and then the second one in the International Journal of cancer in 2008 the data showed in terms of a summary antiox is enhanced treatment outcomes increased survival increased tumor response or both in all but one not statistically significant study so we've only looked at gold standard research the majority of studies showed antioxidant groups had decreased toxicity I have tables and tables and tables I could have given you a two-hour presentation just on that alone these papers no trial reported a significant decrease in treatment efficacy which suggests there's no evidence of interference the last thing I'll talk about is chrono and I'll show you just one piece of our data so I mentioned timing of drugs it's not just what time of day every drug has an optimal time of day or night when it's the most effective in the least toxic so much so that it can reduce toxicity from 25 to 85% and so much so that it can actually boost the effectiveness of the drug from 25 percent up to 200 percent I'm gonna show you an exception this is an ovarian cancer trial that's a four hundred percent improvement in five years survivals so it's the drug is given instead of given as a push or a steady state even concentration drip what we're doing is we're sneaking up on the cell little tiny dosing and incrementally increasing until it Peaks called the sinusoidal wave and then mirror imaging it back down again and by giving drugs that way at the right time and some drugs should be given in the morning their lark some drugs or nighttime drugs summer afternoon drugs I didn't do this work William reshef ski-doo this work literally hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed articles started off an animal work all VA hospital funded and migrated up to humans and the data and it's done actually in Europe and it's done in the Mideast in Asia in the US there were four centers were the only one that hasn't retired my bad but anyhow so the you know the problem is is that Medicare and insurance doesn't pay you anything for it so nobody wants to purchased the technology to do it but the effects are amazing with patience this is showing right here the schedule a is the chrono group and schedule B is the non chrono group this is metastatic ovarian cancer randomized controlled trial 50% reduction in complications from treatment 80% reduction in the need to reduce the dose of the drug or widen the interval in terms of treatment", "KpPA4jG815I": "hi everybody and welcome to another episode of heart to arts my name is shayna khande i am the founder of heart to arts and today we have jen she is a baltimore based cbd ceo founder of bjubi hello jen hi hello and we kind of started talking about this but not really your curls look lovely oh thank you day five it's time time for the wash i actually like it when it gets a little like big so i love myself some volume i also recognize that the winter is doing my scalp a disservice it is over sand yeah yeah she's dry she's my hair is dry too it's very dry it's nice to see the natural natural same to you i love you too thank you [Laughter] um so can you talk a little bit about be jubilee and how you got started sure so be jubilee um i founded it back in late 2019 um i've always had sort of a relationship with cannabis in general and i knew that i wanted to get into the industry but i had a very very um stable and well-paying um i.t career um but the you know i was sort of at a at a place in my life where i kind of was trying to figure out what's next for me and my mother um introduced me to cbd actually she was using it to help her relieve her back pain and i didn't know what it was i'm like is this cannabis is it legal can i sell it does it work does it get you high i just had no idea what it was and once i started to research it i just knew that i had to get involved and what was very clear to me too was that there weren't um any any brands out there that looked like me or my family or my friends um and so i thought that there was just completely a market that really wasn't being um spoken to so i thought let me try let's see it's been interesting i've never run a company i'm you know i'm usually pretty a risk diverse person by nature so just to kind of step out there leave my my six figure nine to five and to try this was a big deal for me but um i'm here now and i'm so happy to be here bjb is a labor of love um i've learned so much in the last year and a half and they're so far to go i mean i have we're just getting started so um we're here to let everyone know that you know plant-based wellness is an option that is in most times better for you than a lot of the over-the-counter options or even prescriptions if you can you know i don't want to say i mean description some people need them so i'm not going to say there's not a place for them but if they can you know if you can transition into a plant-based option like cbd it's definitely better for you way less side effects and it's actually good for you and your body it's made for your body um and so i'm here to educate i'm here to empower and i'm here to bring wellness i came across really interesting tick tock yesterday where a black woman um was talking about the revolutionary history in black foraging and how being able to find what you need in the earth around you was something that was punishable by law for a lot of you know black people as soon as slavery was over um as soon as well slavery like ended right you know like a lot a lot of these yeah so it's really when i was reading your article that will be in the the link will be in the description below okay um there was there were a couple things that really popped out to me let me see if i could find some of these questions i wrote them down okay in your article you used this quote and i would love for you to just like dive a little bit more into it um also if you hear screaming upstairs there is a two-year-old that is just having the time of his life right um so you said in this article i do not desire to ask white business owners to cultivate a diverse marketing model i desire more black and brown ownership and that that just resonated so with me especially for this industry and yeah talk a little bit more about that just doing like competitive research and looking into other cbd brands like i mentioned before we just we were not represented in any way um and i felt like you know once i learned more even just about like the percentages of ownership in this industry that really should in my opinion be our industry um it just it honestly it it triggers you or triggered me and i feel like you know instead of us trying to um look into these existing brands and big companies to you know be inclusive and to start considering us more and all of that i'm like screw that we just need to be creating our own brands and our own seats at the table and i feel like we should feel empowered to get involved in this industry for so many different reasons um that i feel very strongly that i don't really care to look to those brands to do those things they're just naturally not going to do that because the heads of those companies are typically not people of color they're white men and so um for some for a founder or ceo to to really be um consciously trying to ingrain diversity into their their brand it just doesn't really happen a lot and when it does it kind of feels performative and it's not it's just it's weird so you know let's just make our own brands i remember where i heard it and it's not coming to me but it's like if they're not going to get you a seat at the table make your own exactly so i mean you know the reality is is that um you know they are dealing with a lot of resources and legacy um funds that that typically i mean i don't have it my family doesn't have it but that's part of the reason why i was so emboldened to get involved in this industry because i feel like it's an opportunity for um for me to create that for my for my family and for other people to join in and i always often times am you know getting on zooms with other people who have ideas about getting into the cbd industry or just even the cannabis industry and wanting to just talk through like how can i get started where do i go what you know how do i find manufacturers and i'm here for all of that i really feel like we have to share information um because we we we hold on to information and that that that's deep rooted too there's reasons for that but i want us to kind of start to be comfortable with sharing information and feeling and knowing that there's enough for all of us to eat so i i started with cbd um i started with cbd because it costs less money and i believe in what in its therapeutic benefits um and i saw what it would happen with my mother and i was able to get her transition her off of you know prescription drugs so that was really transformative for me and i believe in it so that made sense for me i would love to have a dispensary i can't afford to there's no way um not yet and you're right at this moment but right exactly um and so i think you know we have to think about other ways to get involved this industry has um all of the segments that any other major industry has you know if you're a realtor even and you want to start working in this industry there's a need for people who are looking for land who are looking for retail like shops that have specific zoning requirements that's a niche if you're a marketing person cannabis and cbd can only be marketed in specific ways that's a niche if you're um an event planner i mean i know we're going through this whole situation with covet but even virtual events like that's a niche like there's so many skill sets that people already have that could naturally transition into this industry that can that can make people a lot of money i'm realizing as you're talking that for black people to enter this industry there's a lot of generational trauma that has to that like hits you right in the face just for confront not even confronting just for just for wanting to do the work that you're passionate about like you think about historically the and you talk about this in your article too what um the the war on drugs did and like the mass incarceration of black people who pretty much started this industry in this country so to say oh okay i'm passionate about this is something that i enjoy learning about this is something i want to share with other people and then to have all of this history this very recent history um depending on where you are what your family was like doing and wanting to like grow into and all of that you might have uncles like recent family members this is yeah very current i mean people are still getting locked up for today so the war is still happening yeah it's it's um that's why it's triggering you know i just feel like i always say it i'm like this is our [ __ ] and unfortunately what's happening though are these big um they're called mso's multi multi-state operators that are making the billions and millions of dollars are white men um you know there are a few um uh black owners that uh and i'm talking about specifically dispensary owners right now um and i don't know if you've heard of viola no um al harrington um his company he's probably i believe he's probably one of the largest msos black owned which is great we just we need more of those um but you know he came i think so al is a former nba player um so he had some money and he i think he made some smart moves and now he has um dispensaries all over so that's great we need more of that um it's tough you know there's a part of me that i feel very um strong i feel very passionate i should say about this plant for so many different reasons because of the war on drugs and because of what it's done to our community also learning good science behind it learning how our bodies are naturally like this plant was made literally for our bodies the way that the plant operates in our body operates is very similar so just understanding all that it's like we've done such a disservice to our black and brown community and to this plant we could be so far so much further along in research and figuring out like how this plan can help us solve so many important issues but because of greed because of racism because of political agendas all you know unfortunately that's not what happened we have a long way to go yeah it should be our industry so", "AqpykAyhObo": "did you

it should for more videos like this stay tuned to our Channel [Music]", "LbCOpH30I3k": "welcome to a very special episode of canvas legalization news maggie and i are coming at you with some more big senate news yeah i mean it's and two for right because not just the banking one but the uh both of congress were busy today so like the safe banking act was reintroduced in the house of congress but then we're also gonna cut to the senate and that's where schumer and two other senators got together today and had a pretty big news conference and so marijuana moment is reporting from an hour ago schumer marijuana bill will stop big alcohol and tobacco from dominating the market what do you think about that miggy you know we watched that video and and i'm kind of excited because they're going about it through committee like they yeah they're they're getting uh consensus together and now that they have this safe banking act going into the the house of congress this is the senate's bill and so some of the stuff we can talk about with the senate is how is this going to be impacted by the filibuster is the filibuster going to shut down any type of real legalization will get out because without those 60 votes to stop debate they could just basically never bring the cannabis votes up for a vote i mean that's what happened last round remember all the votes all the cannabis bills got out of the house but then they went to the senate and died i mean this is the one chance like for the and again we are not party pacific people like i don't give enough what you do just like i don't give an f like who you make love to so but the point is all the republicans are solid against this like like they're like some sort of messed up weird cult where they're just gonna keep together and keep fighting against what over 80 of the american population and you know it's only a matter of time before they it becomes mundane like cigarettes like it's it's just a thing people we we're putting people in jail and hurting lives and impeding people's uh lives over [ __ ] right and so let's go back to the marijuana moment which we've uh become a patreon donor of so that we can access their uh bill tracker so please don't go over to marijuana moment and consider becoming a patreon supporter of them uh they're trying to prioritize small business particularly those owned by people from the most impacted by prohibition and focused on justice justice justice as well as freedom it's kind of funny one of the things we're going to do is we're going to go bring up senator schumer's youtube channel uh and then we're gonna watch his youtube video and then we're probably gonna get more views on our watching of his youtube video because the senator only has like 820 subscribers it's pretty cute but um and i say you know what after we watched a video later on after this uh show go give them a like go ahead so hey cln brought me here how are you doing we're watching you tell him to come on the show we should have uh chuck schumer on but uh so she tweeted out watch i talked with senator booker and ron wyden this week about how we're working together on legislation for comprehensive marijuana reform so this all came out today and then senator booker tweeted about his other buddies senator ron wyden and senator schumer legalizing marijuana is not necessarily right is to not necessarily right the wrongs of our failed drug war but it is not enough we must expunge records and lift up people who are unfairly targeted yeah and and where's right widens it's past time to end the federal uh prohibition on cannabis and the failed racist war on drugs so here's the big moment uh when they were watching it and uh chuck schumer said it's time it's ready to move we're ready and one thing i love that my colleague who's the chairman of the finance committee understands and focuses on is the fact that this is also making sure that these tremendous business opportunities are being created that this multi-billion dollar business is not just the sort of big uh wall street-backed money uh interesting yeah we don't want the big tobacco companies and the big liquor companies to swoop in and take over the legislation we have will make sure that smaller businesses businesses in community with uh in communities of color get the advantage because the communities of color have paid the price for decades they should at least get something back i mean it's nice talk but i i'm afraid they're going to become like illinois you know like you guys have that social equity program how much money has been given how much money has been allocated to 21 million but i mean like really yeah yeah that's that money's and then one of the problems is now they're starting to like try to like reallocate the money they're like oh the monies are coming in let's try to reallocate the monies don't reallocate the monies and so the that's one of the nice aspects of social equity plug those monies directly back into the communities that have been most disproportionately injured and also i don't support having real estate taxes pay for public schools because that just disproportionately enriches the schools where the wealthy people live because they pay more real estate taxes and so that if your school system is funded that way your school system is funded in a way that's going to automatically prejudice uh the poorest and then benefit the wealthiest and i just i just think that's stupid so i'm glad that uh our school system was able to get like six hundred thousand dollars which it really needed uh this year because of the social equity uh cannabis uh taxes that get re allocated to the systems of the areas of the state that were most uh you know impacted by the war on drugs but that money being allocated as being more for infrastructure where's the uh the foot and the door and giving the the disenfranchised people the ones that they everybody wants to talk about social equity right where's the chance to give the uh say somebody who only makes 30k a year you know and wants to have a chance to to be a grower or something you know they're not going to raise half a million or whatever it is to get that yeah but that's that's any business is very often who can access capital i don't care if you're opening a restaurant and it's called chipotle i mean like eventually that person put together a business plan he started he organized his company in a certain way i mean i realize he's just selling burritos but he organized his company in a certain way so he could like have a huge stock injection or cash partnership from a mcdonald's yeah and then get that money and then he had access to that capital and you know it's that's that's capitalism that's business and so like being able to access that type of capital and and then being able to go out there and trying to raise that money so that's like the safe banking act passing that's great because now like anybody else you know just like a restaurant you can get a loan uh yeah having that access to financial cap you know uh of services will really really help but then um maybe some type of license allocations that are supposed to reflect the community and so like if your community is 40 black and the amount of ownership of the cannabis stores in that area are like one percent you know yeah i mean that there's your uh you're in your proportion your disproportion of the you know the money out there and but who are these uh these small companies that she was talking about though i mean it's gonna be state operators right because i mean that's really i mean especially in limited states so if you're looking at like a new jersey like are there mom and pop atc's in new jersey you know uh i'm not sure i know gti's there i know cresco just signed a deal in massachusetts but i think like you're right though once uh federal legalization does happen it's going to hurt these companies who structure themselves based off limiting markets like that's good business period right it's just uh someone hoarding and saying ah it's all mine but when you have equal access and equal opportunities right i mean the cannabis industry isn't oil you know it's not just under somebody's property or not you know and it's not just one of those lucky people that happens to be on top of like uh oil fields that's not how it works you can grow it somewhere else and so like there's some lucky people that might just have real estate where the weather is really nice for growing the stuff great you know they have that for strawberries too but you have the ability to be able to go out there and grow it and so that's one of the reasons why we advocate for those micro licenses for cultivation so like at least a hundred plant licenses out there for somebody to be able to go get and and then from there if they are good move up or get out of the industry yeah and i think part of my beef with the situation too is you know what's hurt a lot of the the legacy the true legacy the true pioneers for cannabis as far as the conversation everything it has been the lack of ability to have a infrastructure regulated market right because a lot of people when you're doing old school there's no taxes there's no uh you know no no no no licenses there's no permits there's no there's just me stealth at night coming through with a quarter pound and knocking on your door and 20 markup and then walking away like that's normal basic business but then when you have the tier system like you're saying if someone wants to have a restaurant they're gonna have to have a business plan there are things that people aren't taught that essential infrastructure and how to get involved yeah well you know operating a big i operate a business it's pain in the ass sometimes but you know it's it's what you have to do if you want to be uh in business you have to pay your taxes or that'll catch up to you you know and then your website's going to get hacked because it will uh it just will but anyway when can we expect the senate to move on this this is like one of those stories that i don't really like it's like stories that we do about new york legalizing marijuana it's like will they won't they are they gonna freak are they gonna do it yet are they gonna frickin do it and then meanwhile virginia's like hold our beer and they just legalize it over a weekend and then like you know and you're like damn virginia just came up and legalized it that fast oh it's not effective to 2024 how convenient and so like when can we expect this legislation to be introduced in the senate let's see what chuck schumer had to say about that are going to be introducing legislation shortly and it's exciting and it's imperative and we will get it done okay good work my friends uh what do you think uh shortly and they're gonna get it done and then they bumped elbows right you know on this getting done well here's here's the the misperception too that we have about the process in congress and senate and house and and why and con you know just everything over in washington is people think [ __ ] happens like overnight just because they put out this youtube or whatever uh things like oh okay tomorrow they're gonna go to session no there's an actual schedule like they have to meet at a certain time this committee and then there's only so many times throughout the year they meet so if they don't uh initiate that conversation during that time of those meetings well that's it that was that was your chance just like washington homegirl here never made it out of goddamn committee uh you know just a lingering goddamn you know committee is where bills go to die saying it's happened to a lot of bills for cannabis it happened to all well actually uh the senate was where all the cannabis bills went to die last congress and so will the senate do it this year i don't know i'm i'm kind of thrilled though that they've given this press release on march 18th as soon as they got the coronavirus relief package off the the president's desk the next week they're already starting to talk about cannabis again makes it really exciting they introduced the safe banking act again in the house but then of course like with the way that the legislation works you know you're going to have to have it be joined between whatever's in the house and whatever's in the senate so that we have an identical bill that then hopefully you know president biden will sign what is it going to look like i don't know a few weeks but they're committed to get it done i just hope you know and this is so political showboating [ __ ] uh uh branding but what's a deal with americans like we like to do like all the policy on 420 like it seems like a bittersweet [ __ ] like let's help people now let's fix issues now not not wait till some landmark freaking bullcrap day that means all kinds of stuff no no people are losing time now and yeah uh turner who just threw us 20 bucks that's ridiculous thanks so much man 10 of them yeah 10 of that's going to go to helping commissary we also have some other ways that you guys can start interacting with our channel evidently we're now a membership channel that's right youtube allowed us to gamify it so you can join membership levels miggy's got a membership level that he should tell you about i'm gonna pull up our channel but hang on let's let's just kind of dive in real quick remember go subscribe to chuck schumer he only has 869 subs let's see um dude we got half the subs watching that i know and i understand like there's now more people watching this at 180 people that have viewed this whole thing it was only viewed 173 times it just makes me smile a little bit but let's go behind the scenes of cannabis legalization news here's our thing and now i guess it's called is it monetization oh no i i'm unfortunately all that they all know the secrets now and so we have memberships now and so we have oh my gosh two completed uh we have uh we have three different types there's a lounge member there's miggy's next story and then there's legalizer in chief and then there's some uh badges and then some emojis evidently the emojis we have are my face miggy's face the fire emoji and then cln's logo is is now going to be an emoji and uh there you go it's uh it's cannabis legalization news the game the emoji is awesome dude i just uh i mean wow that's [ __ ] dope but yeah i didn't know as far as the uh the subscribe base you know what donate to that level and i will put more stories out and and and so is that going to be only for those ones that uh donate or is it gonna be a general oh you have like back door level permissions and so like you could have it be hey guys you know thanks for helping me get this story together you can publish it and then like yeah so now when you go into the videos you can hit like members only different levels of members and stuff for those videos and as a result of that like i could do like webinars on here and be like don't forget to you know this is a webinar for uh

another one on the detroit legacy business plan that we're working on right now and then after that there's a whole bunch that we're going to be doing on new jersey with their conditional licenses and their other stuff and so i'll do those and then i record it and then i'll unlist it and then after i unlist it then i email that to everybody who's on our email list so go over to cannabis legalization news or cannabis industrylawyer.com and sign up for our email list and you'll get notice of those i'm excited and yeah i'm excited to add more content you know this was a you know and we will so are we gonna for for tommy's pre-recorded one are we just gonna post that as our live one for wednesday are we gonna or should we record it and then view it together with the audience uh we can always set it as a premiere party but then i have no idea because like because we're going to record tommy chong's episode which is which is going to be good but at the same time then if we're recording it we might want to edit it after it's recorded so it might go to processing for 24 hours or so because you know like we're going to want to put in all the best bumpers that we can because one of the things we should play with tommy chong is you know we're going to do another very special episode of name that strain uh so on today's episode of name that strain i'm gonna go to solo layout and say hey hey hey everybody remember that remember name that strain go ahead and try to name that strain all right uh and that's the uh the strain that we're gonna try to name today i'm gonna say uh more of a sativa leaning no look at that it's more chunky than a sativa the of course i i haven't seen a natural sativa in forever and i'm sure if you're like talking about like a 15 page 15 foot tall haze plant that's going to be like a huge cola like the size of your arm for for tommy's a show can we get the just hey man written on top of that hey man hey man name this straight hey man name that strain yeah uh that would be pretty cool uh with the hey man and then see if tommy chong wants to play name that strain too i i would uh uh you know i would appreciate that but the um fun times i mean we just had some technical difficulty and it was too bad like we'd see him coming in and behind the set and like it just didn't connect so hey but you know we have some news that's out of the senate it looks like the senate's going to be coming in so don't forget to smash those likes hit subscribe and then you'll get news when the senate actually drops that then we'll go through the bill i mean like because like i didn't want to do another story on the moor act we've done stories on the more act like the last three versions of the moore act how much more different is it going to be now versus this new stuff that they're supposed to be doing in the senate i don't know what they're going to call for what if the senate comes in it's like drop it to schedule three and the more acts like uh drop it well i guess it wasn't the more act that was introduced today was safe banking i'm assuming more act will be introduced eventually right well this is why we need to get some sexy porn music when we talk about the legislation process that's right there should only be sexy jazz music while we're talking about the legislation process it's like oh that bill is heading to some floor action you know you're like right right but then again like floor action's literally an aspect of the policy provided that you can make it out of committee but what really can uh all of those types of things well i used to be a senator but now i'm not a congressman low resolution hybrid it has to be it low resolution hybrid you can't see it very well and then yeah yeah there's uh there's definitely some ruderalis in that uh plant it was also an autoflower and so it was not a flower that i didn't do a very good job of growing by the way yeah but hey let's see how it tastes let's see how it tastes uh because you know what if you're watching cannabis legalization news it's probably uh going to be this time somewhere [Music] [Applause] [Music] nice hey uh real quick one of my viewers asked about texas do you know what's going on anything new out there texas actually does have some bills that have been introduced but they have not necessarily made it out of any type of committees or it had any substantive votes one of the things that we can use is our marijuana moment legislative tracking tool to see what types of bills are in texas and then maybe do some content on that i just i just haven't thought texas is particularly serious about legalizing cannabis and so i didn't really dig into theirs i mean i did some stuff and we have some content that i could shoot on new mexico because i think new mexico i'm just a little bit more uh confident in but i still haven't like recorded that stuff on new mexico to put that out because it's like well is sb12 gonna pass or in it and and then we'll just kind of wait and then there's some more stuff in pennsylvania we need to do because sb 350 that was dalen leech's one that's expired and they have a new version of that so we should check and see if they still have the cool stuff or if it all sucks now dope no uh uh i think lauren just sent us a message here i'm sure you'll see oh we're gonna start giving clues that's hilarious this purple and crystal coated indica strain is a cross between afghani and thai stick but no that one is a cross between a chem dogging and a rudolph alice plant it is by mafesto genetics yeah i agree with marianne though too many old guys stopping progress in texas i mean but that's the kind of the situation in even just the big scheme of things right like if you watch uh a hearing i mean just the half a stupid that comes out of these guys like the the idaho representatives and the ohio representatives you're like who who is your constituency is it like the third grade like what's the you know it just seems like a big crazy shell game that if you're not paying attention these jackasses are getting over on a bunch of their people locally which seems to be but anyway you know what uh we'll we'll hit it up later if there's more news that drops between then and now we'll hop on uh it's a friday news dump something may go on but it could have just been that thing that chuck schumer and the other two senators ron wyden and cory booker dropped and so what do we think do we think that we're going to have the bill by 420 i i unfortunately think it's gonna be a weird ironic [ __ ] yeah i think i think unfortunately let's do it tomorrow but no these jackasses are gonna wait til 4 20. well they'd say we have the legislation coming shortly i like how they have i mean like they understand press and and stuff and promotions it's like when are you going to have this done soon yeah so why did you call this press conference to let you know that it's coming get ready get ready ready we aren't going to allow these big alcohol and big tobacco companies to come in and swoop in well what are we going to do about it just a second we'll tell you in a bit yeah that's let's hope i think so though i think something's going to happen and and the only thing i think is important enough to happen would be just to release the people at least everybody that's incarcerated right now i mean that would be one step yep all federal prisoners getting expunged would be fantastic and then of course like how many of those prisoners are in there where this was just like an interloping charge that got in there you know like it's just in the stack of the crap they found them guilty uh with or even in their in the legal states like like my friend adella wisdom who's going through prosecution in goddamn missouri but yet another part of missouri they drop charges against somebody because they're like oh well you have a medical prescription so we'll not chase and she's an activist a year years like 15 20 years like like me who's been standing up for the planet it's a low-hanging fruit when it comes to criminality this is just yeah we're going backwards but we're also going forwards at the same time right you know um and this is like when we're talking about a plant where all the facts are really on your side uh we aren't talking about something that you know where there's that moral slippery slope or somebody's getting hurt or anything like that um and that's how hard change is imagine if you were really trying to change something and then all the facts and evidence weren't clearly on your side it's never getting done you know oh man we yeah yeah no it's exhausting but we're getting there you know yeah so what's that strain oh the the name of that stream is creme de la chem from mephestogenetics it's uh it's pretty good i wish that i had not have watched the ph on it so much but next run i'll get it right that's how we learn that's how we learn until next time i'll see you guys in cannabis legalization news", "ThT_J2KhyFU": "how many cans of cannabis does it take to turn a cat into a can real quick this mighty yeah who voted eating is

and well let me tell you guys she is pretty all right so what i am going to do is um i'm going to weigh her my flash will not work because of my uh my cell phone is dead but i am going to weigh her and then i am going to rehydrate her and after she's rehydrated i will come back and uh give you guys like themes of uh how this squish is going you know what i mean so uh let let me uh get her on the on the scale real quick ladies and gentlemen all right here we go she's tore out she is exactly at 3.5 grams i'm sure whenever i uh rehydrate her she will be a little bit more so yeah i'm gonna use a raw hydro stone like i normally do uh hydrator for maybe four or five hours and i will uh yeah starting the pressure and this time i'm going to use a uh 25 micron okay i want to see what happens there so uh yeah stay tuned i'll be back it's gonna be a fun one boys all right youtube fam we back man we about to smush this bruce banner all right she's all nice and rehydrated the phone is all nice and tart so we got the flash on right let me i uh this out real quick you'll see that so she is definitely over rehydrated which is very good look how beautiful these buds are man it's almost ashamed to press these things but you know what i have a feeling that this is going to produce some good medicine like i said i'm using a 25 micron bag shout out to uh dilly tech filter bags dilitech press you know who the [ __ ] it is uh still waiting on my uh shout out daily tech but you know it is what it is anyway yeah look at this [ __ ] fire bruce banner aka the hawk let's get it youtube she's just about at the temperature i got her uh packed up um i do not know how uh this this um uh 25 micron bag is going to work because it's so long but uh we're gonna [ __ ] find out huh so i have a nice thing rolled up just put a sticker up in there she's really long so hopefully uh it doesn't cause too much of a problem i'm going to slowly do it right you know how i do it slowly uh put the pressure down on it [Music] there we go uh all the all the uh the pressure on it now alexa set a timer for three and a half minutes [Music] [Music] so i have no idea how this is going to work out uh this time uh and it's a 25 micron bag uh i will show you the difference real quick this is a a one um what 125 i believe i've been using and this here is a 25 it's a big difference in uh micron size [Music] just going to sit here and watch this thing of course i'm going to edit through this uh you know nobody wants to sit here and just watch the thing cook for three and a half minutes so i will uh edit the little parts uh you know like right now i'll stop it then i can pick it up again if i want to you know see how we're doing looking good looking good alexa how much time we got left [Music] okay alexa how much time is left on the timer all right i have no idea how the rest of it looks because uh you can't see it so i imagine it's probably looking pretty damn good i'm hoping beautiful um all right let's see what we got alexa stop the timer okay alexa stop the timer [ __ ] all right let's see boys come on baby let my fire [Music] not too shabby [Music] take it right on off they're like so um i got some um some scraping to do on the edges there bud i'm going to press her one more time i actually got some um pretty good good uh information today and uh i'm hoping i'm going to fold this this bag up too by the way uh and hopefully um with this this phone call and uh this person i talked to today shout out to my ex-sister-in-law you know my brother's ex-wife uh you know who you are

other good stuff that you know you need uh you know to survive in in your future you know i gotta start thinking about you know my long-term uh future you know what i mean like retirement stuff i'm turning 33 this year and um my body is is used and abused and i feel like i'm an old man like i wake up every morning and and so much pain between my my back my hands my knees are starting to bother me now you know like yeah i just i i just can't keep going with with the career that i have been doing basically my whole life i can't keep doing it so i mean it is what it is guys i mean yeah i just i need to i need to uh to move on you know so hopefully uh you know i don't end my uh long long uh my long time at uh martin storage on bad note which i don't see why i don't see why he would get mad at me for trying to better myself well you know if he did you know [ __ ] him he's just using me anyway that's pretty much how i feel about that i've worked there for going on like 16 years all together and uh you know i'm getting paid [ __ ] punk ass 13 an an iron you're gonna hire uh guys who ain't even been doing it a year or two uh don't know nearer as much as i do and they get paid a dollar less than me that's not cool he lights up okay alexa stop you know what i mean that's not cool at all anyway enough with the rant and raven and [ __ ] and [ __ ] let's uh let's get back to this uh bruce banner [ __ ] rosin pressing time baby there oh no no don't do all that don't do all that if we do all that now come on man she did too that's [ __ ] that's the second press i wanted to put it in there because you guys can see it slid right there and uh i got a good bit of oil on so i put it in again just to see if i can get that oil uh back out all right guys there's the first press beautiful beautiful beautiful right there's the uh the second press not bad just like appreciative besides that smudge right there sorry because i managed to get it back baby yeah so uh yeah i'm going to uh collect it and get back reach out boys let's get there remember like i said in my last uh few present videos take your time at this party spend the money to uh you know get the flour and stuff and spend take the time in the process of of uh pressing and getting this nice fabulous material here um yeah and it's straight up pure medicine man so take your time you don't want it to uh flake away or you know get lost in the process of collecting it because sometimes if it's a cold in your room it will become like a shattery consistency and it will flake away and uh you will lose it and we'll never be able to find it yeah this stuff is coming off it's not like almost sugar already if you guys can see that beautiful beautiful i'm using the 25 micron bags from now on see how it's starting to fly away little pieces yeah you want to get all that you want to get it all all right there it is ladies and gentlemen i will lock it off of this little dab tool here and put it on the little uh thing wait up and see what we got all right we're about to see what what she weighs man we got that all collected up that nice bruce banner fresh press rosin right here man let's go right so i got this little piece of paper to get it off just use your body temperature your fingers and slowly but surely just wiggle wiggle that dab tool back and forth back and forth okay of course there's there still will be some a little bit on the sides i mean you can simply just get that by doing the same damn thing yeah man um one thing i didn't do was uh tear the thing out so i will fix that issue real quick all i did now is i just cut another little piece of paper i'm going to tear this all right this guy on let's see it's zero and put that guy on [Music] all there i'm simply going to take that and put it on that all right got me a nice clean dab so to do this process real quick get these other little pieces get it all right i get it all gotta get it all right um point three zero three point three is not uh it's not the best but we still have uh the other one which is really hard to do right there that's the second and third press which that was uh i believe point two i don't know the paper was point two yeah so that was point two yeah so point two and point three three four five six seven zero point five uh half a gram not that not the best yield but hey it is what it is and i tell you what this stuff right here let me smoosh it down a little bit this stuff right here is clean i mean clean ladies and gentlemen i can't wait it almost looks like a hash rosin bro all right make sure y'all smash that like share subscribe if you guys like these uh little pressing uh vids that i do man just just holla at me man let me know and i'll be uh happy to make more of them all

speaking on solve unless extraction explained rosin bubble hash dry sift Erica was a founding member of mass roots and is now director of marketing at pure pressure in Denver Colorado Eric has worked with canvas companies in every facet of the industry and today we'll be talking about solvus solvent 'less extraction techniques all right thank you all for coming I'm gonna try and make this as informative and interesting as possible I'm really excited about solving this extraction and thank you all for being here by show of hands how many people here feel that they are at least somewhat familiar with solving this extraction great that's what I was hoping for the beginning of this is going to be a little bit higher surface level and then we're really going to kind of get into some details some of the topics we're going to be covering today it will be about 30 minutes of presentation then I'd like to leave you know at least 15 for Q&A at the end we were getting a lot of questions at the booth so I want to make sure that we can answer as many of your questions as possible so what we're going to go through today is a lay of the land of extraction in general and we're a solvent list fits into that some of the advantages and challenges of solvent list extraction how it might fit into your facility or someone that you know the popular types of products and textures as well as you know myths and what's almond less can and can't do so this should give everyone in here good idea of what solvent less extraction is all about where it's heading in the next year or two things are changing very quickly and the main products that we will be focusing on our ice water extracts you know otherwise known as bubble hash dry scepter Keef and of course rosin kind of which is becoming the big daddy of them all so I'd like to preface this conversation by basically saying that you know the future of cannabis really is processing in your average grocery store anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of the perishable items are actually produce virtually everything else in a grocery store has been processed in one way or another so what we're really looking at is cannabis being pretty much the most versatile drug for recreational purposes and medical purposes that can be turned into so many different things everything from every edible that you can ever imagine people are already seeing that vape pens abs and concentrates of every texture that you've ever seen and perhaps have never heard of we are pretty much on the cusp of a global market and it's easy for us to kind of lose sight you know in our states where we can't even move products across state lines things are very siloed and segmented in the northwest some of the concentrates are starting to make their way up here a lot of the popular textures that people are paying $100 a gram for in California are now starting to be produced in Oregon and Washington where you know they've been in California and Colorado for a year or two already so a lot of the trends are coming out of Colorado in California but I think as time goes on we're really going to see products that are sold out for potentially a year at a time Boutique growers that are so popular with their concentrates and their products once those products can cross state lines that you'll be seeing people backward for who knows how long and this is kind of focusing a little bit we're solvent less really fits in is in the boutique end of the market really high-end products so going more from that you know more and more consumers or seeking concentrated products and we're going to go into some facts and some data a little bit later in the presentation but anyone that follows MJ vis new frontier had said a lot of these great data sources pretty much concentrates are being consumed more and more at the expense of flour so a high amount of flour is basically being converted into concentrates and as Colorado Washington Nevada California those are some of the main areas that decent data is available on your over your concentrate consumption growth not just solvent list but all concentrates in general is increasing and we expect to see that same trend over time and pretty much all maturing markets that once cannabis becomes legal people are very excited they're purchasing joints and flour and you know this is great and then their taste preferences tend to change they say oh well how about edibles and what is a DAB and and what is that going to do for me and of course as people's tolerances grow they're looking for different experiences so pretty much across the board in Colorado and California concentrate growth is right around 25 23 percent depending on where you're getting your data from that as a percentage of the products sold in the northwest the data that we've been told is right around 18 percent so there's definitely still room there where it's growing there's a lot more consumption of concentrates that's going to be happening virtually everywhere as the markets expand so to really define solvent was extraction what we're looking at is a process of mechanical separation and mechanical separation is different from using solvents because what you're having is various physical forces that are separating the trichomes and the cannabinoids as opposed to dissolving them into solvents so when you're running butane any hydrocarbon co2 any of those solvent based processes what you're running into is a dissolution of avenues and terpenes and then your reforming that taking things out you know recovering your solvents so mechanical separation is anything from shearing breaking things open with rosin and we'll get into that but that really is the main distinction and what I'm not gonna spend time talking as much day is what's better because people have all kinds of different taste preferences we believe in peer pressure that there are solvent based concentrates that are absolutely elite and made very well and when urged properly but what we've also seen is that a lot of companies will take products that aren't the highest quality necessarily and then they will use that to put that through certain hydrocarbon and other systems so one of the big things that we're going to talk about today is where quality fits into the equation and how quality is such a big part of being successful with solvent --less concentrates but it's important to understand that when you're actually making a solvent less concentrated you're not dissolving it with a solvent seems pretty straightforward but that's one of the questions that we get all day every single day to go back a little bit you know hash is being made for as long as of millennium almost the the earliest reference that I could find when researching for this presentation was eleventeen 23 that there's references of hash being made in middle east so solvent list concentrates called that have technically been around for maybe a thousand years or more people have been making hash in various ways all across the world mainly concentrated in Asia the Middle East where it was getting started collecting resin from cannabis plants forming in different ways I'm sure a lot of people especially people who have been you know consuming and been around for a lot longer than I have Thai sticks Turkish hash all kinds of different products that before were the concentrated potency increases that people were consuming and now we're seeing this absolutely massive proliferation of different textures concentrates extraction methods everything that you can imagine so cash has been around for a really long time I'm sure a lot of people here may finally remember you know sprinkling Keef on a bowl or a little bit of round bubble hash and you know increasing the potency of whatever they were smoking and layering into a joint and now you've got you know 99.9% pure THC a distillate that will take you to the moon and back in a tiny little dab so we've seen a massive massive evolution in the way that concentrates are being produced and we expect that to continue I mean this is really the tip of the iceberg with solvent Wisconsin traits as well as solvent based and who knows if there's other categories that are going to get developed that we're not even really aware of right now I mean this is really all just getting started so pretty much where we're at with the main separation here so I just wanted to give everyone a little bit of a lay of the land I think a lot of people have familiarity with concentrates in general but just to kind of educate everyone on where things break down these are the primary methods of solvent based distillate is can be run without solvents such as in steam distillation or it can be used with solvents and of course the main solvent list categories that we're going to spend most of our time talking about today so one thing that you'll notice here is that on the bottom of this fairly busy slide is that there's a lot of textures and one of the things that we run into a lot is that people are saying well can I can I make sadder with a rosin press and the answer is that you can most of the time now with hydro carbon you're looking at a much bigger array of great you know various textures that you can actually access compared to co2 for example or ethanol or distillate simply put hydrocarbon and rosin tend to be the most versatile in terms of the textures that you can actually create with those systems so you know blog Reza and terpene separation diamonds shatter wax butter I mean there's a lot of ways to skin a cat with how many different forms and textures there are a lot of it comes down to personal preference you know if you could go back in time 3 4 years and start talking to people about diamonds and sauce they would have no idea what your apple sauce like what are you even talking about they don't know shatter was of course this huge revolution people were taking dabs and it was pretty much all made with butene sometimes at home sometimes in a very sketchy on fire now not a very friendly environment to be doing that kind of but now people are figuring out all kinds of very very interesting ways to make kaleidoscope of textures with different terpene concentrations all kinds of different flavors it's really becoming such a boutique industry across the board that now as well as in the solvent list category where before we were really just looking at Keith's bubble hash older forms of hashish you know if anyone's familiar with Frenchy canola or someone you know the big name older hash makers you know there's all these different ways to make solvent list but now rosin has really come on to the scene as a popular concentrate that's growing very quickly in the past couple years one other thing I'd like to point out - is that well co2 ethanol and distillate I just have them listed as oils a lot of these products are being used and substrates for adults so depending on what you're trying to do virtually any of these products can go into edibles which then of course your complexity of the products that you can offer is times a million because how many things can we eat there are better and less better ways to make edibles depending on what you're shooting for but one of the things that we run into again a lot is that you know what what can Roz and really do what can you actually turn rosin into and the answer is that almost everything that you can with hydrocarbon which we've actually been surprised by some of our clients who have been actually taking us to school on what they can do with some of our equipment people are doing full-on terpene separations live rosin with fresh frozen bubble hash that they're washing people are making solvent list diamonds you can make shatter with certain strains depending on the terpene concentrations I mean wax all the other textures are all being made by certain companies on rosin presses as well so it's pretty cool to see that you can spend a lot less on equipment and potentially make some of these textures I'm not going to spend time talking about the hydrocarbon and the other systems in this presentation but I just kind of wanted to show everyone where the textures break down because there's a lot of variation here and it's something you hear about a lot so I wanted to cover some myths that again these are all based on questions that we get in our inbox and get a call all day every day is that solvent list is less potent that's the first one people have found a way to isolate THC a with a rosin press where you're getting 99% potency with it or it's white crystals that are coming out and they're nucleating those crystals into the large diamonds and then sometimes they're putting them into other products but the fact that matter is is that with a solvent was set up you can actually make extremely potent concentrated products at chalice of last year the highest rosin test result of just a dabble oil product was in the low 90% range so extremely potent and generally speaking in this some we're going to talk about a lot is it really boils down to quality and what's in there in the first place so if you're running very high quality material the potency of your solvent Wisconsin traits can be extremely high 60% tends to be what we've seen test result wise to kind of be the bottom threshold and that's not necessarily a bad thing not everyone wants to take a dab of THC isolate I mean I know I don't it's too it's not really what I want some people are looking for a little bit more of a mellow experience and they can have that with a solvent list product the second one shattered does not equal VH oh you know one of the biggest misconceptions that we hear is can what what is shattering you know what is this even and shatter is simply a texture of cannabis concentrates that behaves like a thin glass you can break it with your hands it flakes there's a couple companies out there that have really perfected the process of making rosin shatter and it's one of the more popular products that a lot of companies especially a couple of years ago you know it is popular it was popular it depends on what state you're in but sometimes shatter is the buzzword shatter equals concentrates people almost don't even think about the other textures it's just Cham Cham Cham people are making shattered with solvent less concentrated setups the third big one here is that solvent list has less terpenes you know terpene content we've seen tested as high as 16 percent or more just slightly over with salt on the sauce that's a company called a vlog if you're in Denver that we work with it's pretty incredible some of the test results that people are getting with their material they're able to get I mean even some of the lower range bubble hash frozen's are getting 5 to 10 terpene content so when you open that jar it you know it's hitting you you're smelling it it's extremely potent and what you're really finding is that you're getting a full spectrum extract with most rosin you're finding that as well as with bubble hash and just as an aside even though it's not about beer just for everyone's information full spectrum basically means that you have a range of cannabinoids and terpenoids concentrates are going to offer a full spectrum package meaning you haven't distilled it down to simply just THC a even though just like we talked about that can basically be done here but you're offering the full range of terpenes and cannabinoids depending on what the plan is giving you which can lead to the entourage effect more palliative effects for certain people it's basically going to be the most genuine representation of whatever plant that was grown when it's being processed into solvent that tends to be the most genuine and authentic way of making a concentrate the last one can't be used hemp is being processed into CBD hash and people are selling that even on the Internet I mean in Canada it's the Wild West right now it's absolutely bonkers up there you can buy CBD hash rosin on the internet today and have it mailed to your door I wouldn't recommend it you do not want you know people don't want the FBI know that you're buying that from Canada one thing that we've heard a lot too is people haven't had great experiences with rosin you know for all the people that have had burnt popcorn flour rosin I'm sorry you know the industry is still learning but now out there you will find products if you look for them that are the highest end that you can pretty much imagine and we're really excited to see where can be used with rosin it's a process that doesn't play as nice with solvent less extraction for reasons I'll get into but it's pretty exciting what people are doing across the board here with extremely potent concentrates the textures that we're talking about the terpene content and being able to use hemp in it as well so to kind of get to the beef here we've got our three primary categories of solvents concentrates ice water hash this is one probably most people are familiar with at least at some level and that's where you're using cold off cold water and ice they're breaking and making the trichome heads and stocks brittle and they're breaking it off of the canvas material itself into a slurry of water which is then filtered through different micron screens and then it's dried so that that's the basic process of making bubble hash it's made by hand and drums it is made in portable washing machines that people would buy for using out in the backcountry people make bubble hash in all kinds of different ways and probably something that will continue to be improved upon we feel that that is actually one of the categories that is expecting to see the greatest evolution here in the next couple of years because many of the professional bubble hash washers out there either washing by hand or again using one of these you know two or three hundred dollar you know portable plastic washing machines making grams of bubble hash full melt that sells for $100 a gram California you know there's something there's something not right there but if that's what it takes to make that product then people are doing a very good job of it the drying process is something that has been extremely tricky and has been the realm of virtually experts only until just recently drying bubble hash you have this wet sopping mass of trichome heads and stalks if you're doing it right and then actually dry that down so you're not getting mold microbial issues it's a very tricky process doing with air drying but now people have found out that with the life--all ization process using freeze dryers you can pretty much take all the headache out of making bubble hash by popping it in a freeze dryer and 24 hours later it comes out perfectly dried it's a little more complicated than that but a point being it's a lot easier to than air-drying and you don't have to be an absolutely tried true 10-year veteran of drying it dry sister Keith again this is probably going to be the most familiar category my picture is pretty blown out there so you can't see it just pretend that there's Keith in that little box what we've got here is instead of taking your cannabis material and putting it through water to break off those trichome heads with cold temperatures you're just sharing it so the best Keef is usually made very gently we find that a lot of the bubble hash when people come to or excuse me a lot of the dry sip that people come to have us press for demonstrations is sometimes less than 50 percent trichomes and the rest plant material that reduce all kinds of stuff and that just doesn't do very well so when you're making dry Ceptor Keith you know you definitely want to be gentle on it less is more sure everyone has smoked Keith and joy Keith seen it and smelled it Keith can be a little tricky though because people want to beat it up a little bit too much but the goal with both of these products is to keep the trichome heads as intact and unbroken as possible when you start feeding up Keith you're gonna find that those trichome heads are splitting open you're getting your oil and all these other things in your mixture which is not going to be conducive to rosin which is where pretty much all this is heading and polo hash and sift are now mainly being used as precursors that are being pressed into rosin because consumer preferences for Keith have come way down people simply aren't buying very much of it a lot of the dry sift on the shelf isn't very good in some places so a lot of places are taking that Keith and processing it into rosin and same goes with ice water hash you know what could have passed is high-quality bubble hash a couple of years ago is now something that might not ever move on a dispensary shelf because of people's preferences and how they've learned to you know love other dabs basically a lot of places that are doing all of these are still making full melt bubble hash which is something that is fairly difficult to create but what that essentially means is that is the highest quality level of your trichomes that you are receiving through your bubble hatch washing process sometimes when you're watching hatch none of your trichomes are full mountain and full metal basically meaning that if you put it on a nail you melt it you're trying to dab it there's zero residue left behind so what many solvent lists extraction Labs are doing that are focused on this are they will take their full melt bubble mash if they're able to produce it they will sell that in grams or half grams for high prices and then the rest of their grades that wouldn't pass as full melt is what they're going to go ahead and do is mix those all up together and then press it into rosin so with rosin you're using heat and pressure to break open the trichome heads and stocks which is releasing the oil and then it's being filtered through a fine mesh bag so that leaves a lot of the plant material and the other stuff you don't want behind it has the oil coming out it doesn't need to be purged it's ready to consume pretty much immediately and this picture here again the fidelity isn't there but that is actually an example of rosin chatter that's classed over that somebody pressed out so I just want to talk a little bit about the physics of rosin and how rosin is being made because people are gonna find that rosin is extremely disruptive to the concentrate industry in general rosin is something that people can safely make at home rosin is something that any amateur grower can purchase a rosin press and make dabs at home with their own material knowing that they grew it it doesn't have pesticides in it they're comfortable with the quality that they're growing hopefully and that they can process it themselves so what we've got here is a little bit of diagram that one of my co-workers put together for us which is either using compressed air or a hydraulic cylinder you're pressing a bag that is full of Kieff bubble hash or flour one of your substrate materials the pressure is being applied and then in between heat and then you have your oil coming out and depending on the distance between the center of the bag and the edges of the plates that's really going to dictate sometimes how high-quality your oil is sometimes people will press rosin on a giant t-shirt press the evolution of rosin presses has come a long way from hair straighteners to t-shirt presses to commercial rosin presses too now you know we're on the verge of releasing a pretty much fully automated version of our press that press buttons it presses it goes so in three or four short years you've gone from you know guys Shanghai and their girlfriends and wives hair straighteners to squeeze the juice out of a nut to you know a fully automated system so it's pretty incredible to see how fast things are changing here now this is one of the really big categories that we get a lot of questions about which is you know what are some of the advantages of solving lists and then where does solvent lists tend to struggle and I wanted to present you know very honestly and openly where solvent list has challenges is where as some of its advantages come in so I'll start with the good which is that it's vastly cheaper to get a solvent less extraction system going I mean if you're trying to do bubble hash and rosin and you need sinks you need you literally have an empty room and you were gonna start making solvent less processing you give that going anywhere from twenty to forty thousand dollars you can get started much much cheaper more easily it's very simple and you sit and you don't need that much to get going it's much cheaper the yields are comparable to hydrocarbon and other extraction methods popular contrary to popular belief this all really boils down to quality which is something I'll get the challenges section but that you can get solid yields with solvent lists if you know your grower and your genetics or high quality that's really where you're going to be the most successful one of the biggest advantages is that it doesn't require into safety considerations you know see what do you want rooms people that are familiar with extraction rooms and build-outs it could be extremely expensive some people can spend as much as a hundred or two hundred thousand dollars just getting a C one D one room architected and put in place not even including the equipment that they're putting in there so when you're pressing rosin we were making bubble hash there's no solvents there's nothing flammable it's pretty straightforward the safety protocols or much more simple fire departments are very friendly we work with the Denver Fire Department and I actually gave a talk in LA earlier this year to fire departments and they they almost laughed me out of the room because of what I was talking about like I'll solve unless like why are you even here we know that's fine so the last thing we've got under the advantages is it retails for a really high price per gram so again every market in every area is gonna bear different prices depending on different consumer preferences but like I was saying you know in California in Colorado you're seeing premium grams of these products retail from anywhere from sixty to a hundred dollars sometimes more on the recreational side of things think craft brewing that's kind of the best analogy that we have is you know it's easier to get started with it it's cheaper most the time that people are really involved in this they have you know boutique genetics that they're really emphasizing and trying to put out there some of the big challenges with rasen scalability especially compared to co2 or ethanol I mean if you're running co2 machine you can put tons through those with our equipment which has some of the highest throughput on the market you're looking at 10 to 15 pounds of dry sift or hash in a day which is a lot for a rosin press but compared to a ethanol or a co2 machine you know that's that's a drop in the bucket for massive massive processing so again smaller production if you're if you've got a bunch of low-grade trim or middle stuff that you're trying to run you know rosin pressing might not be the right method for you because you have so much you have to go through the quality might not be there it's probably not going to deliver the results that you're looking for the real real big thing here is that it demands high quality material and certain genetics to be successful so if your material is very high quality you can be successful if your material is not your yields will suffer you are not going to be making good bubble hash you are not going to be making great Keef and you are not going to be pressing good rosin frankly so you know people sometimes they'll come do demos with us and they bring their all this swaggiest material they can find and they think you know I saw this all this gold pouring out on your YouTube channel can you do that and you know we're not alchemists you know rosin and solvent list is not alchemy you cannot turn lead into gold and when it comes to solving lists it's really an arms race to who can be the best grower to make the best nugs the top-shelf crystal mugs to put into their solving the system so Dad logic for example one of the companies in Colorado we work with they probably made more rosin than anyone in Colorado they work with a company called Verde natural which is their grow arm in the business there are two companies and what they do is with Burt a natural every time they pull a harvest down dab logic comes in and they take all the buds they want they get first pick they come in they pick out all the best stuff and then they sell everything else on the shelf daba logic washes it now to some people that is a horror story because they're selling a flower they want to sell their best notes but again as these markets evolved resin farming is going to be more and more of a thing where people are actually growing specifically for the purpose simply of extracting Green Dot labs and Boulder is a great example there are innumerable examples in California and of course in the northwest as well there's last but it's a growing practice where people are simply growing just to extract they are not even selling their buds they are watching it they're blasting in everything and then again it works best with premium flower whole plant fresh frozen or high-quality Siddiqui you cannot just run trim through a rasa press it is not going to be successful there's too much plant material in the bag itself your yields will really suffer so there's always a little bit of post-processing going on to make some of those premium products whether you're washing your stuff and hash whether you're sifting it there's a little bit more work on the front end a little bit less work on the back end because you don't have to purge it whole plant fresh frozen is really the way that a lot of the elite labs are washing bubble hash to make the best quality products and then one of the real big ones is it doesn't reduce or remove contamination so if you've got PM in your product and you're trying to press it into rosin well you got PM in your rosin and that is bad nobody wants to smoke that so please don't do that it's my humble request to all of you whatever problems are having in your grow it's gonna come through the bag there's just no way to get around it you would need a micron screen of a coffee filter three four or five microns to be able to filter that out and maybe not even there so you know it has to be clean and if you've got a big crop of stuff that's contaminated rosin and solvent list will simply not work unless you're trying to poison people so you know a lot of people they'll take that material and they'll blasted co2 there are better efficient ways to process material that's been compromised solvent lists just simply is not one of those ways so just some market information just kind of go over what we got here premium full melt bubble hash and live rosin to retail for sixty five hundred dollars a gram in 2017 rosin was the fastest-growing subcategory in Colorado in Washington the growth is really happening there and then overall concentrate consumption growth has grown by 11 percent Oregon last year MJ Piz I'd highly recommend anyone who does purchase or check out their Factbook they come out with one every year them and had said they it's worth the money if you want to learn the data this is where this is pretty much all coming from and then 13% of the processors pull reported using solvent list as their primary extraction method so to us we were surprised to see that we thought it would be less than that but there's actually a lot of companies out there really pushing solvent lists and that number is absolutely growing so getting towards the end here premium fresh frozen bubble hash can be turned into some really really cool products that people would expect on the bottom left here you have a hundred percent solvent less cartridges that are being sold by dad logic no PG no VG no holes of fires is coming off the press exactly as it goes into the cartridge that is absolutely possible can't tell you guys how it kill me but it is happening solved it with sauce that retails for so much it's crazy and then you've also got THC isolate these are things we talked about as well as food grade oil from leftovers so whatever isn't your primo stuff can also be made into high-end edibles so pretty much you can use all parts of the buffalo with solvent less no matter what you're doing there's a place for it and again the premium fresh frozen derived bubble hash is really the building block for a lot of these exotic concentrates textures and things that are being made with prosit so in some solvents concentrates are really quickly becoming a huge part of the market here especially the high-end market because of versatility someone can go buy arroz impress make all these different textures at home and you could be a one-man band and and make some of these products you don't have to invest a million dollars and getting your extraction lab started most of our customers are actually existing processing labs that might do hydrocarbon or co2 is their primary extraction method but they add on solvent list to create a premium product so doesn't take up a lot of space it's easy to get started it's also very simple to learn so we really see solvent list as becoming you know one of the bigger ends of the boutique concentrate market as things evolved in the United States and abroad it's a highly versatile system you can make all kinds of different products with it it's not very expensive and it's very safe and easy to learn so you know as it becomes more known we're expecting more and more and more people to really latch on to this and have you know my little girl I'm gonna process some of this and then I'm gonna share it so these are some of the big companies we work with Willamette Valley alchemy is here in Oregon same with Queenie labs they do really great work and we were actually at a dispensary yesterday and we saw some bull valley alchemy hash we were really excited to see that there are definitely companies out here making really good products so I'm pretty much right there thank you all for coming love to answer as many in all questions and whatever questions that we don't get through in the next couple minutes we're at booth 406 right in front please come talk to me and come talk to us we're here all weekend and love to answer whatever questions don't get there so so every question go ahead and raise your hand we've got about 10-12 minutes for questions and I'll bring you the mic the back back in the back so if you have a pound of really high premium flour and you take it through a good rosin press site from your company what kind of yield in grams of rosin comes down the bag and a typical situation yeah great question there's a range of yields we see anywhere from ten to thirty percent so with premium high resin strains you know well grown gorilla glues chem strains there are certain strains that really overperform you're gonna see in the high teens low 20s and that's just with flour Oz and the highest I've ever personally witnessed was 31 or 32 percent roughly out in California some guy that's the material that didn't even look good and it just important so to expand on that question just a little bit too with Keith and sift you're looking at 30 to 60% for a sift rosin and then to bubble hash anywhere from 40 to 80% we've seen it go as high as into the high 80s some people have claimed low 90s we're not really sure where that falls but with bubble hash it goes way up from there raise your hand if you've got a question they're very good we I used the freeze dryer and now you put like you put like four or five pounds of web-savvy you know if you don't wash it with a freeze dryer and when you bring it out you get like these you get wafers anyway like nothing I mean but then the liquid that comes out of the freeze dryer smells so good you slap your own mother for what's in there let me just have this cloudy foggy material with this light oil that like builds up on the top of it why is all my wonderful yummy smells leaving my bubble hash and a freeze dryer man yeah so what happened how in God's name yeah so when you're freeze drying bubble hash is what's happening is you are warming up and freezing it's the sublimation process of your trichome head so when they're in the freeze dryer they're gonna be warmed up slightly it's all happening under a vacuum so that water that's coming out that's draining out can have a lot of terpenes in it you know it's coming out of the drain wow this this smells so good yeah yep so the short answer is that it kind of comes down to process you know we we come come by the booth and let's talk about that because temperatures dry times how long are drying it there's ways to try and minimize terpene passive turkey loss through your you know the water that's actually being extracted there are definitely methods and things that we can you know hopefully point you in the right direction on that you know good bubble hash when it's being freeze-dried right in the terpene content you know hopefully your hash on the other end is still smelling is still smelling really good but there's definitely some ways and things that you can even do with that water potentially so [Laughter] I'm gonna have the same thing yeah so so some of my clients are running into processing rosin that's really Turkey okay and it has a hard time staying shelf stable because the tur player tends to separate do you find that that is more process-oriented or more cultivar or strain oriented good question so what we find a lot is very high terpene content rosin tends to be less viscous so it's very oily it can be hard to work with a lot of it comes down to a storage properly so making sure it's in an airtight container as best you possibly can making sure it's in a refrigerator or a freezer you know slowing that process down because with a lot of rosin if you leave it out it will naturally tend to auto butter you're gonna get that separation it kind of sweats so it depends on the strain it depends on the material all kind of the the the short answer is storage can probably have a huge effect on how well the separation slows way down we tend to have customers telling us that when they're doing it right that their shell stability is somewhere in the realm of two to three months if they're using those techniques if you leave it out at room temperature if you're leaving it in a non airtight container it could I mean 24 hours big-big can auto butter sometimes so and then the strain itself again I think that oils more down to the terpene content within it and what kind of textures you can have available to you other questions what would you say in general are the best strains to put through one of your pieces of equipment yep so the component at the baseline more resin higher potencies gonna there's more to work with there when you're making rosin so again grill glue almost a little played out at this point people still love it huge producer a lot of the chem strains really really do well chem dogs there's there's a million back crosses in the chem strain one of the one of the companies that we work with a lot Oney C code Tropicana cookies there's some fruity strains that work really really well Crockett's farm some people might be familiar with them strong Nana there's some fruity strains I wish I had a more specific answer about the exact terpene profile that some companies have latched on to that they know overperform I was given the explanation once but it kind of fell right through my head because it was super high level but basically you're very resinous high yielding high potency plants are always going to be typically over performers when it comes to making solvent listen right now we got time for one more covered everything well if you're Eric thank you very much [Applause]", "QVHmD-BSUHg": "the sound is always round it is always connected to the string it really does feel like you're sinking into the string not just into the metal wrappings it becomes a true extension of your musical personnel it gives a sweet as stronger sound and a warm clear sound to it i couldnt hear more overtones the feel of pulling the bow over the string was really really soft and smooth and I would say almost a velvety kind of textured it's them five ten percent extra for every professional searches for such a speed it has a very textured complex layered salad with a very quick attack i would say surprisingly quick attack it's made playing spicata much more much easier much clearer the articulations are just cleaner for my staccato in my accent that this robin is making me a better player the sound produced are very prompt it has less whistling on the e string do you think that it is very good for the humid weather in Singapore I don't want to be reminded I'm a beginner I just want to make music and some event allows me to do that because it does take that edge ups a little technical missing I might have oil changes it can't disguise a little bit so it's very useful from I don't feel like I have to force or push my sound that the rosin is just supporting that it can sound you that I'm able to make with less effort it's just has astonished me it's really easy to play a really rich time that's also quite easy as well so to play really nice soaring melodies and higher strings when doing things like the Barker you major potato probably in a very large in that there's made a lot easier by the sensitivity of the rosin it gives a beautiful warmth it softens the sound it's something that I would definitely use more for Brahms Schumann Schubert Beethoven I've got one objective opinion from my husband even though he knew how much this broad and cost that this was digging he found better the sound is something you can trust describing the sound of the subtle blending is like assembly line the first initial quality and sound is a caramel like texture it's a vote through the action it's neither running not brittle it's almost like butter and perfect room temperature the second stage the sound is the time as it begins to develop the complexities as a stream reaches isolation point the finish is smooth and lasting offering the most unique and important quality of this particular blend it's the ability to create very", "2XJUZBC6Frs": "what I'm excited about the mirror on the industry now is black farmers have really started to gain a reputation as some of the best roars like they just make some great smoke my first interaction with canvas I remember very vividly um it was after school with a couple of friends we went down to the lake and I actually got high and then since then you know I've had a natural affinity for cannabis I grew up you know in Virginia and Florida South Carolina Georgia I moved on with my my engineering company and decided that our candidacy was better best for me my name is Jesse Horton I am cannabis industry professional working in the business aspect of cannabis with a dispensary and a cultivation center and processing center as well as with the regulatory side of cannabis and an activist the founder or co-founder and chairman of the minority cannabis Business Association when I was growing up right the first time I smoked cannabis I was like wow this this is it you know I think a lot of people who are have that strong connection with cannabis had that one moment or two where they said you know what I just feels good to my body for some reason on this this helps to even me out this helps to make me feel good one thing that we commonly hear in the industry is there's not enough studies there's not enough information out there dr. Knox chill should jump on you if you say that you'll point you to a number of different studies out there and a lot of great information to help you get understanding of the efficacy of cannabis I am a cannabis specialist but we know about the science of cannabis is that it helps bring our bodies back into balance what we've found through study of cannabis is that we all have an endocannabinoid system it controls our neurologic system it controls our endocrine system a reproductive system our digestive system it controls everything it keeps us in balance cannabis is just a phenomenal tool that happens to interplay and work on that system so well that it treats I mean a myriad of conditions I can talk to the gynecologists about how to use cannabis to help treat her his patients conditions I can talk to you an oncologist about how cannabis can be used to treat their patients we've only I think scraped the surface of what the endocannabinoids system really does the plants right now they're in about week to week two and a half of flour and you can notice that by the the pistols that are developing we'll show you that first it's a female plant so these are going to be the buds that will develop over the summer and this has probably about seven more weeks to six more weeks to go before it'll be ready to be cut down dried and cured and delivered to patients the modern medical school is built upon pharmaceuticals most patients become consumers for life when I went through Medical School I was taught disease processes I you and find out that you're a pre-diabetic or a diabetic I might discuss some nutritional changes that you can make but I'll certainly discuss starting you want to medication you're gonna get worsening diabetes over time unless you change the reason why you have diabetes in the first place it wasn't until I realized that my education had had really failed me in that way that I went out and learned about how to reverse diabetes naturally why weren't we taught that you can't patent food like you can pharmaceutical medications as a whole minorities people of color aren't as healthy as a majority right and there's a number of reasons access to health care housing affordable housing health education because of that we're seeing a number of diseases that are affecting us more than they're affecting the majority the medical system conventional medicine disproportionately sales people of color leading causes of death are heart disease cancer and Stroke we are less likely to get appropriate care for those conditions and we're a lot less likely to survive we can use cannabis in all of those situations even at the time of a heart attack or stroke to reverse their the consequences of those diseases we can make a huge impact on the health of people of color with cannabis but we have to know that it exists right or else we're going to keep on going to that conventional system for it it's quick fixes and it's pharmaceuticals that are both harming us X ice the rate of everybody else dropped off the product out of here we were defeat I had a lot of altercations with my parents whenever I was smoking cannabis when I was in high school my mom maybe maybe was a little bit more than reefer madness type of mom I would come home and she'd be looking at me from all the way across the room like your eyes are red your eyes are red I said my dad was rooted in reality that the likelihood of my life being ruined by cannabis was much higher than the majority lots of people up has become a way in this country you know in our new video on the new rtj video we showed you over the last 20 to 30 years the incarceration numbers from the 1980s until now they have grown exponentially like they seem to double every eight to ten years Dex area and these people that are entering mostly are nonviolent drug offense my first cannabis arrest happened when I believe I was maybe 19 years old I was driving we had been consuming in the car so when the cop pulled us over he said hey I smell cannabis I thought all the cannabis was gone because we only had a little bit however one of my friends had some cannabis still on him and kind of tucked it in the back under the seat he ended up finding it says whose is that the guy wouldn't fess up I was the only one that got arrested and everyone else was able to go let's be very honest arrest equal money for municipalities when you have municipalities you need speeding tickets you need petty marijuana charges you need to you I you need court costs and fees like that's how we paid for a city and if you were honest with ourselves about that we would be safai the new system we would do away with making that same criminal and we find other ways to tax people without being punitive and without destroying people's lives so many things are tied to having a criminal record and not intentional that is very much intentional housing discrimination employment discrimination benefits discrimination student loan you're not eligible for certain shelters if you're homeless I mean we need to change the law but we need to figure out not quick fixes but we need to figure out individuals as well [Music] [Music] you [Applause] things like this on growing programs like this and working with partners like Marley natural who understand that we can use the prosperity of the industry to help these communities to thrive I is a key way for us to turn over that new leaf and to make this transition into a new era of the cannabis industry in the cannabis plant today we're here to come together and recognize and reconcile the harms done by the war on drugs we bring in all the legal representatives all of the tools that someone needs in order to get their record expunged we're submitting it for them in order to get these felonies and misdemeanors taken off by expunging and taking this step we can help people to open up those opportunities again when you understand and really open your mind up to the knowledge of cannabis as opposed to just looking at the stereotypes of what you see on TV how can you really have that same opinion we have to just start giving more knowledge out there as part of what NCBA wants to do is really help to show people the truth about cannabis and I think that the more we do that it will become a very very normal part of our society black people James Baldwin told us right prohibition doesn't work it usually punish yourself first I don't care what your preacher says I don't care what your politician

Michael gebben with fiddler shop.com and today I've got the rosin that has taken the internet by storm it's the leather wood bespoke rosin now there are two types of razzle there's the crisp and the supple I've got both of them and the advantage I have is that I have two of the exact same bows that have never tasted any rosin except for each of these so I'm gonna play them back-to-back for you see if you can hear the difference now before I do that just a quick explanation is that I think about rosin the same way I think about musical sound and that there are two main elements there's attack and then there's decay and decay can mean like sustaining also but eventually to nothing and each of these Rosen's really cater to each of these elements the leather would bespoke rosin first sets itself apart by all the beautiful and handcrafted details including the wooden cradle that holds the rosin and the leather wrap and tie each one is beautiful and one-of-a-kind the crisp really shines in the attack it's kind of really sticky quicker and brighter and the supple is a little bit darker warmer kind of more luscious bow stroke throughout the duration of Buster so here we go [Music] [Music] so what'd you think could you hear a difference I think the crisp was interesting and you could hear a difference I think in the second excerpt that this picado and staccato is really clean while the supple really shines more in the first and third except these bigger luscious sounds and you achieve all this without really taking on the rosin it's not doesn't create a big cloud of rosin so it is expensive rosin but it chances are it doesn't cost more than your strings and one cake will last two years so if you're interested in trying it out just swing by our store otherwise to

this is the kraus 4600 cultivator with the k tines on it and so we have put new shovels on it uh those are the ones that were cut for in between the row there's the back full one and uh we did use 10 inch sweeps uh the guide fans had been sitting in the dirt and so we did cut brush them or no we actually used a sanding disc flapper sanding disc and we sanded those off and oiled them nice and checked all the bearings in the depth wheels and so i think we have the cultivator ready to go now that we have new shovels on it we are going to park it in iron or park it on concrete we're in the barn so that the shovels don't rust but uh i think it's about ready to go to the field uh one thing i want to show you and i just figured this out so i'll show you on this row right here some of the shanks the catins the way they do those uh clips you can either put them to the back of the thing or you can hang them on the front of the thing the front of the carrier there and so you know once we get into the field and we see how they're throwing dirt and how the residue is flowing uh we will we will figure that out but basically in between the row here they're mirroring each other so on this rank see how they're both back and then the shank is on the front and then we go to the next row and both the tubes the carrier tubes are in the forward position and the shanks are on the back and so that makes these two run side by side i like that now we get to this row here and we have them reversed and so you know obviously when they're side by side they will ridge more up right in the row and they will do a better job of burying weeds when you're running at them in that position right there they will do a better job right there throwing dirt up yeah but there may be times when you have to stagger them so that they flow material you know such as if you had a problem with morning glory and so uh we will run them like that for a while and we will see how they operate in the field so there's the exact same position and they're across from each other and there's the exact same position and they're across from each other and so we'll just run it and we'll see how the how stuff flows through the elevator and we will make our adjustments then but i think that we have the 4600 cultivator ready to go", "Lza6IwbXEVM": "we looked at this factory I wandered around and I thought boy this would be a perfect spot for the farm-to-table movement of created locally creating basil and microgreens and leafy greens of that sort I flew in a few real experts in vertical farming before walking in the building they told me I was wrong they'd say but you know if you have no moral qualms with it I think that cannabis industry is really gonna start in earnest here in Massachusetts you might want to look into that and my initial response was I I'd get more personally use out of basil but I'm happy to buy basil I mean while employing of all of these folks and hopefully creating real boon in Fitchburg all I wanted to do was create jobs in Fitchburg with no plan outside of trying to utilize this asset this big brick factory as not a real estate developer how do how to turn this on to create jobs Fitchburg at the time had about twice the national average of unemployment so cannabis legalization was a part of our dinner table conversations for many years it's a chain of businesses and a chain of jobs that you're creating all at once you need cultivators you need master cultivators you need breeders you need folks that can deal with a genetics program and then you need a full kitchen we need people to run that you need amazing culinary experts you need engineers and then you come into the dispensary and you have hospitality experts you have folks that have designed this the the millions of dollars that come off of that and the town of 40,000 people is a really big deal it's really been an evolution started by people with open minds and I'm thrilled and proud of Fitchburg for becoming this real open welcoming not the cheapest which I didn't want them to be the cheapest but the most welcoming territory in Massachusetts to cultivate it sometimes I get to macro in this industry and I get disconnected from what goes on in the dispensary and I come back and I hear these anecdotes of my child used to have four seizures a day and now she just had her first seizure in the last two months or I had back surgery and I was terrified to get addicted to opiates and I turned to medicinal marijuana and I never felt a symptom of becoming addicted that's amazing we hear every day about the worsening opioid crisis and maybe it's because I'm so deeply entrenched in this industry but I don't hear a lot of other solutions not that this is clinically tested yet which we desire to be anecdotally it's it's irrefutable it's irrefutable that this has a really positive impact and for their life to be so drastically changed and then their kids lives and everyone around them to be so drastically changed that's amazing [Music] you", "esFngkKLiXc": "and i'm going to introduce our next panelists the final the final conversation of our meadowlands experience um we're talking about cannabinoids terpenes extracts concentrates um and exploring the evolution of manufacturing what's the difference between resin and rosin sauce shatter what's up with dabbing um we have a killer lineup here today i'm pleased to introduce joseph encinosa he's the founder and ceo of oakland-based concentrate company gold drop joe has dedicated the last 10 years of his career to innovation in the cannabis concentrate market as a pioneer and expert in cannabis concentrates joe has created extractions and formulations that have earned gold drop more than 100 awards including first place finishes at the emerald cup and high times cannabis cup welcome joe thanks for being here next we have tony verzura the founder of blue river terps a solvent-less technology company that licenses their proprietary equipment and standard operating procedures to qualified state licensed manufacturers to create blue rivers trademark branded products tony is a cannabis inventor who has earned more than 80 cannabis awards for his farm-to-table approach to small batch rosins and sauces blue river uses advanced mechanical separation techniques for isolating cannabinoids terpenes and full spectrum extracts welcome tony last but not least we have roger volodarsky who's the ceo and founder of puffco rogers a serial entrepreneur tech fan and cannabis connoisseur who is on a mission to make the highest level of consumption devices accessible practical and effective for everyone since 2013 pufco has created the most awarded vaporizers and products the puffco peak is a smart rig device designed to unlock the true power of concentrates providing the clearest expression of the potency flavor and effects of the plant they're derived from with no learning curve we got our own puffco peak for the meadow office last emerald cup and the candy paint is really makes it a fun way to smoke as a team so welcome everyone this is not a moderated conversation so we're just going to let the three of you riff and chat and ask each other questions and this is very much a consumption friendly space so enjoy yourselves and i'm going to pass it to roger if you want to ask the first question of your fellow panelists sure tony joe who would have thought guys not certainly not me not when i met joe on i think the side of i-5 five or six years ago are you in here joey yep i'm here hey what's up roger there he is good to see you guys um i'd love to just start by quickly asking you guys how did this journey begin for you because i don't think i actually i might know the answer of that for you joe but definitely not for tony so let's start with you joe how how did you start down this crazy path um yeah you know if we go way back uh growing up cannabis was actually kind of demonized for me uh so i i didn't really start actively uh using and engaging with cannabis until i was in college um and a lot of the myths were kind of dispelled all at once my very successful dual majoring roommate was smoking all the time um and i started joining him i ended up finding out that it helped me concentrate i can kind of just zone into what i was doing and um taking you know adderall and ritalin and things since i was like in second grade i like stopped um and i didn't realize how significant it was kind of at the time in the moment but looking back that was kind of my i guess first big switch it was a big realization for me and then i saw it help my grandfather gave him a joint to smoke even though he told me he doesn't smoke that [ __ ] boy um while he's going through chemo and i saw the changes it had on on on his experience with chemo and gave him the ability to beat it back be back is on hodgkin's lymphoma three times um and uh and from there kind of you know i think uh i i knew that this was not going anywhere and this was very real and i felt an urge to be a part of that as my dad was growing he'd been a lifelong smoker all of a sudden me and him you know could relate again and we started going together i started making hash in his kitchen it evolved to me visiting friends out in california and seeing that this was really happening this was very real there were stores and there was products um and it was being taken seriously uh so i moved out here and and we started growing and started making concentrates and i think i found a kind of a space and just you know taking what's out there and and coming up with new ways or or just you know delivering good products for people and the rest is history awesome thanks joey um tony i want to ask you this but i actually i'm starting to remember we've been doing this for so long i have so many things i forget i'm starting to remember your post um that you made about coming from florida and what it means to have taken a chance joey's also from florida what it means to have taken a chance on something that's heavily stigmatized at the time that you were doing it really this weird path that i'm sure your friends shunned you for and it kind of worked out i think that's all of our stories but i'm i'm sure everybody would love to hear yours too tony how how how did you become tony blue river thanks for having me guys um good to see you as well roger and i'm going to probably turn this i'm going to turn the question around on you after i answer this because i actually don't know your whole story either um i i actually started uh long time ago i think i was like predestined to be the black sheep of the family and we once upon a time went on a european vacation with my brothers where my dad i'm first born italian in this country and uh he said you know you got two ways in life you could learn with the books or you could learn on the streets and he dropped us off in the streets in europe and said see ya and about four months later he joined us and on that journey um one of my first experiences within 12 hours of landing in london was smoking sputnik hash with some skunk uh bud and a little hash joint so i started right away smoking concentrates as the first time when i was 16. then by the time i left that journey i had grabbed some skunk seeds and uh was told i was going to be arrested trying to get them in but i i got them in and a few years later went to college and always thought about that time but never really never thought it was like something that was possible because it was illegal and when i was in amsterdam in that time and in europe i just had a different you know i was a kid and a different mentality and um i didn't really think that it was like a possibility and then at some point i got into a really bad car wreck um and different things had happened to me some of my buddies were growers i started growing because the doctors kind of put me on opiates at the time this was 1994 95. so i actually started as a grower because i i spent about six months on that crap and uh couldn't eat couldn't go to the bathroom couldn't sleep and i realized uh from a friend of mine who used to she was kind of a roaming hippie but back in that time uh i think it was like blueberry and santa cruz blueberry maybe came around i mean it was sixty dollars an eighth by the time i went from west to east maybe even more sure 90s so he said man you gotta knock that [ __ ] off because you're never gonna get you're never gonna deal with that pain and sleep uh dealing with that stuff and so i started smoking cannabis and i started growing it and then i started making uh cannabis butter and putting it on everything that i had toast and uh making little oils and trying to make infusions i made quizzo with ethanol and like you know scissor hash and things like this i even took stainless steel bowls would boil them with water throw like the sift on it and try to press it with a spoon and then scrape it it was kind of the first rosin i would say that was like 96 98 um and then i had an opportunity when colorado went medical uh to join forces with the crew there and uh was still just a grower um i had a lot of respect for like nicotine giddy kind bill the guys are doing a lot of live rosin or live resin sorry um the first fresh frozen with live resin so i didn't really get introduced to any kind of water hash or solventless until nicotine and so that was in college shout out to nick man yeah definitely pioneer for real um i mean we heard i mean i heard isolator bags mila bubble man things like this but they weren't they weren't in my world sure first person to hand me full melt six star five star mel was nicotine so uh i'm trying to think if i have the same story and not same story but he might have been my first also shout out to nick man he really created an entire yeah so i mean there was a time and a place where everything was indoor and whole plant we did our first green houses uh in denver and you know a lot of brands were built back then but i learned very quickly um through rare dankness and dna and different types of companies that we were working with at the time that genetics was key you know and people really just don't put a lot of emphasis on that and so that's like it all starts with the genetics and what's the resin profile and then the rest of it is really artisanal across between artisanal and science and so we you know the first 25 awards or so was not uh in colorado was not there was maybe ten or five five to ten that were like starting to be solvents but it wasn't until i got to california once it went from medical to adult use believe it or not i said [ __ ] that i'm not into the adult use market and i actually went to california for the medical market um because i felt it was the last stand so i uh was i would say influenced mostly by the d'angelos in the sense that i left everything in colorado um took some things some ideas public that uh didn't really jive with me so i had my first like ideas and like how to like make capsules and topicals and sublinguals and did my first set of patents that way but when i once once i went to california it all kind of changed um those guys gave me a space they gave me a home didn't have to um didn't even have to pay rent or anything those guys kind of put me on the map when i had nothing let me do my thing there at harborside and i met joe and it was actually tim who was uh one of the buyers there i started doing cannabis terpenes in 2014 2015 trying to i got really obsessed with i would say solving this only because uh i kind of went broke a few times so i had a necessity and innovation i was like what can i do without any money and it was hair irons with a bald guy right i know all about it yeah hair iron hair irons and like how do i make something of myself and i started making terpenes and somebody said hey you got to go meet this guy joe from goldtrough because i think the two of you guys would get along you're both from florida and i was like a little lost puppy to be honest with you and i met joe at a little uh taco place and the only thing i had was like vials of clear solvents full spectrum cannabis terpenes and so uh obviously joe's eyes lit up and he was like uh he was like oh let me get some of those terps what can we do and so um the two of us got together and we and i asked you what where's the rest of it yeah that's true you said and i said what do you mean and uh we started to we we both came together and we uh said how can we maximize every milligram and every essential oil from this plant without wasting it and without contributing back into the environment and so um the first venture is the first like we won probably like at least 25 awards it was a really good friendship and a really good ride in the sense that we started using cannabis terpenes themselves to isolate cbd and thca and all of these different compounds and so we started winning a lot of cbd awards together because we realized that we didn't need heptane and hexane and pentane and all these chemicals that we could use the true i would say the true solvents because everyone argues terpenes are solvents but they are they're a group of hydrocarbons and so we use the natural plants hydrocarbons found in those terpene bases remember there's monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes different groups based on fresh frozen and cured and at that time we were experimenting and uh joe lo and behold showed me a dish one day of these little things that he said what did you do to the oil and i said i i don't know what you mean and he was like check it out bro and it was little tiny crystals that were growing in his oil and over the day this was at a cannabis cup and in the sun over the day it was just all of a sudden he was like dude check this thing out i'm like what is going on and he was like check this out and um that was the start of the idea of how do we utilize what's in the plant to make extracts and things like that and then the boom of you know i started selling cannabis terpenes worldwide which later found out ran into some legal ramifications of uh analog derived an analog derived analog derivative of a controlled substance whether it has thc or cbd is dmd legal so using cannabis terpenes thc free is illegal trust me seventeen cannabinoid free terpenes from real cannabis uh i had 17 different issues let's just put it that way um which forced me once again to uh start over and uh myself into solving this extracts damn pretty pretty crazy man yeah very comprehensive story did i hear that correctly that you were really just focused on extracting terps and then joey comes along and is like well where's the rest of the material there's definitely stuff to be had from that i didn't know that that's that's i didn't know that you guys were building on top of each other that way i thought it was just like a convenient friendship because you were doing something and he was doing like this other part of it no everyone thought there was some weird like cold trapping strange thing it was i removed terpenes i gave bro byproduct to joseph joe then removed the cannabinoids and we put them back together and that's how it started for those here that are like either new to the space or haven't been to all these cannabis cups and emerald cups and all these things i don't know that there has been a blue river gold drop cart that didn't win first place at anything that they were going for it just it was the only thing you'd see in that category i would argue for at least at least three years so like this was the most innovative product around it was the first time i think people were trying to really recreate the experience of dabbing in this really like archaic tech you know like the hardware just wasn't great at the time yeah and so these these were two guys that were doing something that i would argue shouldn't have to be done but they were making can they were growing and modifying cannabis to fit hardware and give people an experience that just was not possible before um and i think that shouldn't be the case because puffco has big aspirations for you know making sure that that hardware works around cannabis and yeah we were doing it before you know kind of before uh before you came in and provided that platform yeah we really had to work around kind of the the tools that we had at hand back then and until yeah we definitely build on each other tony's using you know the terpenes uh for separate or like you know that kind of that chirping um using it to isolate cbd and those separations uh started inspiring him into these deconstructions that then started inspiring me on now on the hydrocarbon side to use a lot of those same principles so we definitely have uh have built upon each other and uh and it's been a pleasure knowing tony i'm curious i want to say one thing to that before roger because i do think you have you revolutionized consumer vapor consumer consumption of all extracts not just rosin but like everyone's extracts it was it was this and this before roger really and this and this is very complicated and for the average person coming into the industry like you're it looks like you're doing some kind of weird drug you know and it just definitely and it turned into it well roger when his first things that he released were uh you know the for the the early puffco's before that you know the globes were kind of around and those things just like they looked awful and they were broken every day and yeah they were just the worst um and i remember you know seeing roger at these events and you wanting oil just so you can then use like i need to know how that functions in my device uh so you were taking pieces of our oil as it was evolving and you were evolving a product alongside of the oil that was evolving um and i had the pleasure of i mean knowing roger uh when when the puffco was like a uh a glimmer in his eye you know uh yeah i mean you followed us yeah you followed us and liked our pictures and i'm like oh my god there's like this concentrate company in california that sees what we're doing we're a two-person company at this point like very little visibility and i just hit you up like can i meet you guys shout out to chelsea and we just met on the side of the road and just talked about the future of cannabis and what will happen and yeah we went and grabbed lunch yeah yeah i don't know where it was i know it was like a little italian place we randomly found and just like just to sit down and eat but i remember talking about what we thought the future of cannabis would be and i feel like that's what we both kind of saw play out with people doing their best to mimic in a portable fashion what's happening with dabbing and it was a big part of my history i didn't know that that moment was going to be a big part of my history but it certainly was i guess we didn't even plan this the three of us on this panel this was random random totally random i saw joe's i was like this is too funny two guys that i know well who i'm definitely annoyed for hash of multiple cannabis cups over the years well i will i want to add one thing that um before roger and when i first started with joe i was like since 2014 i kind of had a chip on my shoulder a little bit about you know last i wanted to ask joe this in the sense remember when it was just all platonic like plant-based the botanical yeah like i'm still you know what like what's your thoughts on that and like you know how it how it went from that's what i felt my contribute that's what i was pushing hard for let's get real effects and modulation effects into your oil and you were that's all you had right right so so in the beginning you know uh of distillates kind of emerging um there was you know the clear had kind of come to market with distillate um and it was just in a jar and you dabbed it um they were adding you know non-non-cannabis derived flavoring or terpenes um and and it wasn't really disclosed the time kind of had backlash from from people because they didn't know um when we you know introduced it our stance was from the beginning was we observed that and said hey look you just gotta have the conversation up front this is what we're doing this is what this is let's talk about it and then you can make the decision at the time distillate the highest purity and the most abundant like clean you know source of cannabinoids that you can come across because you you know you were turning just about anything let's say into it although the better the input the better the you know the outcome um you know that abundant source of of affordable cannabinoids uh didn't have a pairing in in terpenes so can plant derive terpenes from other plants that you know terpenes happen far along the you know far in the evolut long ago in the evolution of plants um later on you know one of the branches of the family tree started producing cannabinoids in abundance and we love that plant but terpenes are shared amongst you know almost all plants on the planet they use it for a variety of functions uh pests fungus all kinds of uh beneficial uses so so getting those abundant cheap terpenes and using them was the only option we had um now you know when i met tony and i saw whoa these are chirpings from cannabis this is these are the isolated terpenes this is what we're looking for um and what are you doing with that material because those cannabinoids are still there you know if at the end of the day you're gonna by the way i was throwing it away yeah i said where is that he called it you called it soulless bud and i said give it to me the soul's still there and yeah i did i was like well from and as friendship probably knows and people like when you wash the material after you're done with it like you throw it away you know like you know so it wasn't like i didn't have that option you know i mean rosin chips make some mean edibles you know like nothing for sure nothing should be 300 um i'm curious um uh especially because this is an extraction panel individually what do you guys think has been the biggest leap in the past decade that deserves some recognition of like things used to be this way and then came this critical point and things seemed to be different after that um i know that since i've come into the industry besides not even from not even from cons from consumption for for extraction i feel like when i first jumped into the space live resin was kind of just starting distillate had just hit the scene was seen as like this very elite thing like this purified it's not the image that it has now like this affordable commoditized solution it was something new and brilliant and then water hash started getting better and then rosin started coming along like there had been so many it felt like leaps felt like there was a point where it was year after year there was something new to be excited about shatter used to matter you know and that's not even close to a thing anymore so in this past decade what era even if it's on a personal level of what pushed you forward what was that year that you felt this changes [ __ ] and i will be a part of this change if that exists i think i would say there's probably three uh actual closed-loop hydrocarbon extraction like a true recovery system okay um that wasn't around and i'm not a and i don't extract with solvents but i think that like to watch joe even in the last five years and watch the industry and i was in colorado when i created what we called vpc vac purge concentrates and everyone laughed at me like why are you back purging anything and i would say the whole idea of uh and that's really indra and like other people before us that actually invented it but the industry had a lot of fail tech and built a lot of machines that didn't meet standardization and safety protocols so i have to give shout out even though that's not my lane i think in the last 10 years for sure recovery uh systems and hydrocarbon systems you know and then i think terpenes and then i think rosin yeah if i had to say it was one thing one category that it's it's concentrates in general uh you know they've see it's it's been a an explosion in development um you know all the way from you know allowing me and tony um those that close with development the device development you all of us are here because concentrates evolved in the way they did if you had to say one thing it's been all these little things but if we had to lump them up under some category umbrella um you know flower while the genetics and the breeding of flower and i think ultimately that might have been helped along with concentrates but um that has that definitely been you know something recent but as an overall encompassing thing i think concentrates it went from just like hash finger half you know finger hash scissor hash um bubble hash maybe starting at you know bubble hash and the ice water hashtag boom yeah hard thing for people to use though because when i was like and i was only making bubble hat and we were only making full melt but then i was like okay we have to press it we have to heat this we got to wait for this exact window right and that led to more innovation you know then the innovation that innovation of a device that where like you don't need to complicate this whole thing with timing and there is a purp there is a purpose for it um and there is a whole point to different temperatures and things like that which you put into your device but i really think that the concentrated world as joe saying couldn't evolve without the mechanism or you know some kind of device the devices had to evolve to allow the consumer easier usability and it was a it was i think it was this thing at the same time you know so um concentrates i would agree with joe just in general like concentrates were like not a big selling thing like people were very like there was still i would say flowers were 90 and then it was edibles and now flowers are like 68 edibles are still very strong concentrates have even involved the edible game because now the base ingredients a lot of concentrates are have changed with the evolution of concentrates edibles now now you can have edibles that taste like cannabis or don't taste like cannabis right yeah totally correct i think i think our time is almost up so i'll wrap on this question anybody who has questions for me i'm actually going to jump on instagram and do a live my instagram account is jolly roger so you can come catch me on there i'll keep answering questions because i'm jumping on it to too many to me yeah jump jump on if you want but i'm curious to to wrap on what do you guys think is the future of concentrates how do you see i mean we've all had this conversation years ago how do you see what do you see to what do you think the next evolutionary steps will be that we will see play out in the industry if any or unless you think you've settled uh no definitely not settled i i've made that mistake almost before where i'm just like okay this is like this is the basic the you know vaporization devices here and then here you come along so um you know while kind of the mechanics are simple like a car's car and you know the four wheels and an engine um that concept isn't going to change much for a long time well the car has drastically [ __ ] evolved um so i i think the concentrates will evolve in ways that we're just we we can't even think of yet um ways that we might be just scratching the surface and exploring i know you know we're playing a lot with isolations and you know straight thca htes and you know just i'm excited to see what we do next i don't know but it's definitely gonna i would say that um now that we've reached you know it's not just about concentrates anymore it's about building so whether you're non-solvent or on the solvent side both both sides are able to now pull apart and and keep things uh keep things in their c in their concentration form so like thca thc full spectrum terpenes i started deconstructing things and then rebuilding things very specific for to reduce fats and to be able to build designer dabs and so i think those the ability to do that whether you're in joe or you're myself will help i think in a synergistic way with those different new evolutions of devices and so i think it's important that we had to get to this point so that somebody else can say you know what wow somebody can make a oil that can do this or a concentrate like my trademark thing the flan you know it's like it take it took me three years of evolving to this like consistency that i say this is what i would do with the tech when i got to that level right it's like this is the level of purity and where i get and so i didn't want to stop until i could get a solvent list to 99 purity removing lipids and waxes and designing something that i felt like was my perfect cue to what that would be if i were to make something so once you get to that technology it's like what are you going to do with it so that's kind of like my play now is like when i say when people follow blue river there's rosin there's live broads and dry sift verizon but then there's like my signature [ __ ] that's like the torreon the jelly the flan this is the next evolution this is like okay let's let's let's [ __ ] make designer [ __ ] for crazy experiences with very unique flavors and i know joe's right there on that same path and eventually i think somebody's gonna come along and say okay now that the concentrate game's here what can we do with it and there'll be evolutions of more crazy stuff i want to know what roger's going to do next yeah this is going to be stuff there's a reason i've avoided any questions this whole time we got a lot i know i know i still don't know this guy's story all i know is you know you're that announcement it's a six right yes yes we have a problem that's my birthday tuesday is it well happy birthday bud you're about to see a real a real treat come out that day um we were dropping i can't say what but we're dropping something this upcoming week um so you guys have to tune in to the puffco page to kind of if anybody wants to know what to get me for my birthday i don't know what roger's dropping but that's that's that's what you do it's exciting it's the most it's it's a couple years of work this isn't just like a limited colorway or something this is us going as crazy as we can so i'm excited to see especially what you gentlemen think of this product um i'll answer any questions tony if you want to jump in to my live right after this i'll answer any questions that i may have missed i just rare to get you guys on camera and i wanted to make sure people got to hear words from your brilliant minds appreciate thank you roger thank you i would love to ask you guys a quick question that came up in a conversation yesterday actually if you have a few more minutes yeah so and actually it was during maybe it was during frenchie's panel we had a several scientists and chemists talking about the science of thc and one thing that came up was the idea that like there's such thing as like too many terpenes or that when they get too hot it can be a bad thing um like do you guys can we just dab all day should we what do you recommend in terms of kind of the consumption of these products or do you have any best practices let me take that one i want to just say this i used to dab pure terpenes not knowing what the safety protocols of that is and i can say to you now uh years later that maybe it wasn't the smartest thing to do um so i can take responsibility of that and that is also why i don't sell pure terpenes anymore because i think that there is a there is a volume knob right and i think some people on this panel has seen spinal tap it's a it's a it's a very it's like a mockumentary it's like a documentary that's really funny and there's a guitar i'm a guitar player so there's a guitar player in there and they they have amps that go to 11. well the marshall stack only goes to 10 but there's go to 11. and so look at terpenes like that if the flower is one to two percent terpenes and that's your modulation effect that's your that's your volume and expression on these 31 different receptors that we have identified besides cb1 and cv2 there's actually a total 31. and so if we're talking about full spectrum terpenes both mono and sesquiterpenes and we start to turn that up click click click click click click and so when you get to extracts usually rosin and extracts when you concentrate something at one if you did it perfectly and you were able to eliminate all those lipids and waxes and do it perfectly you would get to a ten to one so if you have one percent terpenes in flour you would essentially theoretically get to ten percent terpenes if you knew what you were doing if you had two percent terpenes in flour you could get all the way up to twenty percent and there's a couple papers out there uh since 2015 that came out that i think people should know about things like mercedes shouldn't be more than six and a half percent concentration in an extract these things could lead to potential health hazards and i think that past 20 percent is something that we shouldn't be going past all even the flan and all of my extracts now at some point we were pushing it to 20 most things that i'm making are somewhere between 10 and 15 um and that is because the lower viscosity oils the higher terpene profile that means this that means we're getting very thin type of oils like distillate tends to be very thick and you can turn it upside down but that when i started pushing like our jelly sauce and our different extracts and i was like wow i can get all the lipids and waxes and everything out right once you get as you increase that volume knob then the temperature comes down most people that dab the flan when it was 10 15 and 10 and 15 percent they take your puff coat no offense roger they take your puffco peek and they use it on red every single one of these hash heads use this thing on red and i was like if you're going to wonder blue for blue river right you can they're like convenient right and so it's like it's because the temperature of vaporization point as we remove the waxes and lipids and we increase the terpenes the vaporization point the melting point the vaporization point comes way down so we could go to 325 to 450 whereas when you talked about chatter that was 650 700 degrees we talked about things that are like thc just pure distillate that takes 550 to 650 in temperature to actually hit a vaporization point so we start talking about things that are rosin based that are more thca based we have a carbon that's released and we have a different vaporization point and so ultimately too much terpenes at a certain point floods that vaporization point meaning if we go past 20 and you're at 325 to 350 you're not gonna you're you're gonna you're gonna combust you start as that temperature that the consumer is at you start combusting so unless somebody creates a device in which can vaporize at 200 250 300 there's no point to go past 20 terpenes and that doesn't exist yet so if you take something that's 10 or 20 terpenes and you crank and you're hitting it like on uh green even green is fairly hot for things that i'm making or red it's terrible same thing with our carts we put a low viscosity switch instead of a high viscosity switch because we want people to be able to vaporize this at a much lower temperature and stay tuned this week bud well like i said until so on but my point my point is it's terrible if you hit most of my extracts hot you're you're gonna hit me up and you're gonna be like what the hell are you doing bro this is terrible i'm like drop it 100 or 200 degrees and then they write back wow this is amazing but from a health standpoint i'm going to stick to my guns and not much is ever going to be past 17 i don't know what you how you guys feel about it yeah i mean uh terpenes are corrosive caustic uh uh some of them especially um alone you know it can lead to toxicity um we kind of experienced that when we were looking at um you know shipping uh botanical terpenes even out to the uh european market uh canvas drive wasn't even an option because you couldn't identify uh identifying all the terpenes in that uh in that essential oil some of them would be over the limits where they would allow them and give them the health seal so um you know we've started exploring that here and there's been some papers written about the you know the corrosive and caustic effects and and and and the health hazards of dabbing uh too high certain terpenes um and uh you know also the um um just the uh you know just like you were saying the impacts on flavor and things like that the the more chirpings that are there and i remembered having just those straight clear terpenes um and exhaling nothing getting full absorption and understanding the kind of the mechanism of how terpenes were aiding in in transportation of those molecules into your lungs um but you just need them to aid in transportation beyond that uh they just don't taste good and they're potentially harmful so um you know is this something that just is this only just exists when you're reintroducing terps or can this happen naturally with rosin or with you know bho so if you keep everything at its normal levels the plant has done a really great job of self-regulating like tony was saying two or three percent on the flower um if we extrapolate that and say okay well you're gonna you know you're dabbing less concentrate than you are smoking the flour um the oil or the thc content is four times as high you can expect to have chirping content four times as high so 10 12 terpenes no problem um it's when you start going really high by maybe doing the separations and things like that maybe that's it can be an issue um and then reintroducing so i'll just real quick on that um like our like live so now that i've been able to mechanically remove all these waxes and flavonoids are another subject we'll probably get to it next year but um when you remove like our live rosin sauces the refined live rosin sauces the recent banana cake i did from fresh frozen hit 14.5 nothing is reintroduced same thing with uh you know jelly sauces and things like people have this misunderstanding that there's a lot of reintroducing happening with us and we're not reintroducing because if you're reintroducing then you're going to boost past this 20 so there's it's just breaking it apart and putting it together or that's natural self-regulation that's it it's what's in the plant and so i feel like just on my experience just you know uh and it's interesting because i so i just did these two these two vape cards one i didn't break it apart and put it back together and one we did it you know our refined live ros and sauce and my jelly sauce is deconstructed and rebuild it and it boosts the thc level but it actually drops the terpenes because there's only so much real estate so like one hits 14.5 naturally one only hit ten percent and that was through this deconstruction and rebuilding but i wanted to get more thc in it so what i found is there's only so much you can squeeze in this in this little real estate right you can't unless you're reintroducing and you're really boosting once you break everything apart you only got so much to work with and based on the flour and i'm not saying that's every flower some flowers have four percent terpenes and so in that case you got to be a little bit careful because um you know it's just there's a threshold and i'm i just don't think we should go past 20 i'm the guy that pushed terps before so you i'm just ah great to hear from you that's that's that's i know friends are smiling over there you like your extracts roger with that how terpy do you like your extracts i mean i really like things in their natural state you know like i i prefer i prefer the limitations to be of the genetics not of necessarily post-processing i think it's one thing when you're doing stuff like tony's doing which is really removing out things that aren't useful to us that you know don't fall into a flavor or feeling category um but i just prefer full spectrum like rosin is great i i am still a believer in bho and hydrocarbon extractions i think if done properly they can be [ __ ] awesome and i've had absolutely great hydrocarbon extractions this year but to me the plants i believe going to resist when you try to push it into an extremely unnatural state like it's not going to survive if it has 25 terpenes naturally on its own i i don't think um so i just prefer full spectrum if you can clean it up a little bit great if there's some fats and lipids left i know there's a ton of flavor in there so i hope my lungs won't mind over time you", "zjK6d_IP3hk": "although we can make a whole range of laws and recipes for you we make two main blends third we sell one is called the supple and what is the crisp I'm going to tell you what those two words mean and why we've made them so the supple Rosen for which this is the main ingredient is sort of a slightly darker resin has a softer feel on the string overall what that means is the initial attack is not too strong you have to sort of work the bow here around the string a little bit more and grab it and pull it however when the bow is moving across the stream the traction is a little grania a little thicker and it kind of creates more drag or resistance on the stream and what this means is if you're playing in really really soft dynamics you have a nice strong connection of feeling with the stream all the way through if you have a very bright and powerful instrument that doesn't need much felt to speak you might find that the subtle can tone it down a little bit in certain settings on the other hand the crisp rosin in which this much more yellow and powdery rosin is the main ingredient has a very smooth and glassy feeling across the stream but a very clean bite and attack so things like sort EA are much easier with crisp and perhaps the beginnings of double or triple stops and loud dynamics are stronger well where this might help if you have a very bright instruments and you want to make it even more powerful say in a very large concert hall that's going to be the line for you however if you wanted to brighten up an instrument that isn't speaking so well in a setting where you need it to be a bit more prominent with your sound that could also either one as well [Music]", "qxESYtdlXCM": "[Music] hey beautiful people it's dr bacon and i got a note to check my p.o box this will be my third third item very exciting got something something in the mail what a way to start the day i'm pretty excited about this let's see what i got that i got to give baby jade and wonder egg nope one more wow this is very nice darling dog i'll be down i got a bunch of seeds well thank you very very much that is like beyond kind i think i can share this so i'm gonna share it uh so here's our straight information this looks interesting i'm definitely gonna have to do some seeds soon a little garden report and still have some tomatoes kind of late in the season um checked out the ladies just now in the barbie house and i wanted to just take you guys along and show you so i'm gonna spend a few minutes up here just looking for hermes take some leaves off spend some more time down here than anything and like there's a decaying leaf i'm gonna see what that's all about and make sure there's no surprises in here so just be patient and pick around a little bit this lady that was previously identified is definitely a jack-o'-lemon the purple is the giveaway so that's that's good news this will be a treat always is okay so i seem to have a lot of people telling me i harvested my ak-47 early and i get this every time i grow one of these long skinny butted plants so i got my loop and i'm gonna take a look at this for you guys all right so here's our mo get a couple i just plucked this from the this is a motorola turbo 2 just a regular phone there's nothing special about my phone you put it on here to you uh so you can center the vignette and then you zoom till the vignette disappears and then you use a loop like use a loop you just bring it in and it should focus on time so here we are with checking out our troy combs and nice nice opaque i really appreciate it trichomes zero clear and an occasional amber could they have gone a little longer they could have this is my source for my willow water and they absolutely never seen them cut these things back so hard but they're not cutting them down half of these are ready for water and half are uh need another day for sure maybe two uh so pretty much the jack glues which are the super green ones are not ready last time i watered them all to keep them in sequence but these are still very very much not ready for water so rather than just continuing to over water these i'm just going to set these three plants off to the side and just water the rest which do need water i have two of these i started in water only as an experiment i'm gonna let those go an extra day as well and keep those on the same cycle as as these that's looking good circle august so this is 8k from the end of august very poorly trimmed but this is as big as it got in the sunshine we have bigger ones in there let's find a bigger one you're going to film this press are we gonna just yeah okay are you ready uh 210 210 i think we're ready [Music] okay my eyes really shrinking down nicely don't come out the side that's all i want from you okay so i can tell this is going to press pretty easily so i'm actually going to up the pressure a little slightly a quarter turn the time or eighth of a turn at a time there we go nice balls down you know you do it right when everything falls off the shelves this is 10 seconds into the press nice looking good there it is good grief that looks good that looks way better than the last one it is there a second attempt oh yeah that's no that was not an attempt that was due okay this is our second execution [Music] nice that's uh round two oh yeah oh somewhere yeah there not quite big enough for those bags i feel like the bags are ideal on larger press it's funny that ironically the ones where you really struggle to get the right pressure come out the best because that means you're actually getting it right at the limit i think how quickly it came out just now flying out of there you can you can see there's a lot on there but that bag is just gonna sit here and get all the good stuff there let's swallow this right now oh it's pretty substantial right there very nice it's been a good dab very nice there's such a pain to get them out of here too i think our work is done here yeah that will serve for our chair hey i'm back i never did find a drummer so uh we're gonna get on that so i can pull my ticket in style for our raffle um so we made some really good uh a rosin with our jack glue and that was really interesting my jack blue plants are dry now we just went through daylight savings my lights go out in an hour so i'm gonna water these when the lights come back on tonight and i never really save mixed nutrients but i did yesterday so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna think i have enough left to do yeah i definitely have enough left for three cups so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna put sand right now and uh i gotta go find me a pretty girl and a drummer and pull this ticket for the gobi hey guys i hope you have the best day and thanks for everything those seeds were awesome thank

off all right how's it going everyone thanks for joining us today's solventless q and a gonna be with eric christensen otherwise known as eric nuggshotz all right getting him in my water hey how's it going how's it going can you hear me okay yep okay awesome i can as well how's your morning going man so far so good just uh watered the plants a little while ago and jumping into this now awesome thanks for taking some time today got some questions lined up uh before we jump into some stuff what are you working on right now you shooting anything cool what's what's been going on last week or two uh i've done a couple live uh livestock shots uh went down to capricorn clones they're uh down in salem oregon uh and uh shot some vanilla frosting that they're growing out for humboldt seed company uh just look saying that's honestly one of my favorite strains right now it's just got the terps are just out of control like third hit in a bong you can still taste amazing flavor um vanilla frosting uh yeah vanilla frosting okay i must be behind the times i haven't even heard of that one yet so is that about to be making waves through the industry is what you're saying i mean i humbled seed company is one of my uh really good clients so i've i've been seeing it for i think it was like two years ago uh they found it at the uh the humble team company megafino hunt and uh i've just been starting to see it a little bit more here and there and uh tried it from a couple different farms and it's amazing so if you get a chance to try it highly highly recommend it okay awesome i i will and for everyone who's tuning in thank you for joining us uh i say this every time a couple times throughout each episode uh today we've got eric nuggshotz with us one of if not the premier cannabis photographers the full episode will be up on instagram right afterwards and on youtube in a week or two if you cannot watch the whole thing so eric tell us a little bit about yourself uh when did you get into cannabis photography so i got into cannabis photography about 2009 was the first time i shot cannabis i've been a photographer it was like eight years old when my dad first put a film camera in my hands and then just kind of been a hobby ever since um and then yeah 2009 hit um it was actually around april uh that uh that i shot my first picture um it was some crazy looking gdp just dark purple smelled it um i'd never seen purple weed before and being a photographer already i was like i want to try you know try shooting this um and long story short like the pictures just turned out semi-okay it was kind of my first experience like with with the depth of field limitations of uh of macro photography it was just super shallow there was nothing in focus and i was like what's going on how do i get a better picture how do i get more in focus and kind of went down the rabbit hole of focus stacking and throughout the next couple years just kind of slowly iterated my setup got some flashes um i was originally doing focus stacking with the ring on the camera um but then actually no that's not right here but i took apart a uh a blazer carriage out of a uh cd-rom drive basically it just laser just slides back and forth on these little rails and i attached a clip to that and i would move the nug back and forth manually to focus stack basically wow you can't get too too close with that because it's like you're doing it manual and you're gonna miss steps if you're like shooting trichomes but i was just shooting like nugs at that point it worked out but uh kind of gives you a better appreciation for the motor control and the snapshot and all the automated stuff i have now no that wow it sounds like you started off with some pretty humble beginnings when did your photography really like become your career because now you know you travel all across the country work with all these grows when did things like really start picking up momentum in your world so i'd say the momentum really picked up probably around 2013 or so that was when i started working um the author of the green a field guide to marijuana reached out to me he had seen my pictures um and then we collaborated on making that book happen and then pretty much past that the the momentum has been really rolling uh 2015 i quit my day job and went full-time into it um didn't work out at first but you know living off credit cards for a little bit and pushed through and you know now we're here and everything's all good but it was definitely a struggle there for a bit so humble beginnings to get your business off the ground and now i know you've hired assistant and there's a ton of demand for your services where have you been lately where have you been shooting any cool strains or experiences you've had in the recent past well the uh i mean so that the vanilla frosting shoot was uh by shoot before last my last shoot actually with highland provisions um and i've got a little uh solvent-less diamond to shoot today uh cool excited to see what that's gonna look out like but they've been doing some crazy solventless stuff uh so it's really cool to see and they're right here in bed so it's like 15 minutes down the road and i'm there which is very unlike it uh most of my shoots are like six to eight maybe more hours away so uh 15 minutes is like a dream right very good a short drive it sounds like you're a road tripper are you in california quite a bit it sounds like yeah yeah yeah california's a lot that's uh honestly i'm i'm from san diego um i'm starting to pick up in the industry i was always driving up to the bay area uh up into oregon sometimes washington and that was kind of what necessitated the move to bend it's kind of like a central home base now pretty equidistant to wherever i need to go whether it's washington canada sometimes although not now coveted nor cal arizona you know it's it's pretty pretty central and san diego is a wasteland for the legal cannabis industry there's not much going on there oh damn yeah well that's too bad uh san diego great city otherwise sounds like the municipalities aren't into it and i'm gonna give this disclaimer to you obviously share as much or as little as you want when some of these hot tastes come up but with your equipment people are already asking you know what kind of camera do you use what's your favorite lens uh what what are you willing to share you know kind of about your setup or at least what you like to accomplish the crazy photos that you get yeah so uh what camera do do you use is like the number one question i get and i like to say it doesn't matter um it's all in in the lenses and the lighting um and honestly the the subject matter like those all factor in huge you could use any any camera you want really um i mean i i used to use a crop sensor 18 megapixel it was a canon 7d and it worked it did the job uh the crop sensor actually gives you a little bit more out of your macro lens just because it's it's not a full frame you're cropped in on what that lens is projecting um now i use a canon 5dsr 50 megapixels so much quality like when i first stepped up and started editing those 50 megapixel coming from the 18 megapixel it was like twice as much time spent on every picture just because there's so much more detail there um wow so um lens i use most of the time is the canon mpe 65 millimeter um it goes from 1x to 5x and it's like the sharpest lens i i own it's insane you can just zoom all the way into 100 super sharp uh kind of spoiled me going to my other lenses like it's not the same detail um and then the other big key uh in my studio is the stack shot and that's my uh macro rail it's uh comes with a little little rail a little uh control box and it just allows you to do all the stacking like real nice it'll go down to one uh one micron so you can have the camera move one micron between pictures uh it gets a little like i have to shoot at that level when i use my microscope objectives especially the dx and the stack shot it's you're just kind of pushing the limit so i actually got a uh it's like an industrial rail i got it off off of ebay some guy was using it to like i don't know do something with dna like really really precise wow down to 0.3 microns per step um so that's what i use now on uh on my really microscopic work and the stacked spins where it just needs the absolute maximum level of precision possible wow that i mean literally scientific grade gear and and when you're shooting some of these i think what people and what i learned when you came out and you know we're shooting with alex is that so many pictures get taken for those little clips that you post on instagram i mean for some of those how many individual pictures are actually being taken for some of those focus stack makers i think people would probably be blown away to hear some of this so for for the normal like stack just one picture uh sometimes up to 400 pictures go into my god 400 pictures somewhere in that range um and i'm just like i'm used to it now it's like i'll take thousands and thousands of pictures every shoot um and it's like it's kind of kind of excessive uh for a normal photographer but you know it's the name of the game with stacks and even with 360s like for my spins it's 160 pictures to make up the full spin basically a long time lapse um and then the most recent stuff i've been doing the stacked spins those are sometimes up to 12 fifteen thousand pictures because fifteen thousand pictures for a stacksman holy [ __ ] you're basically doing a stack uh and you can't do like 400 and in the stacks with the stacked spin because it's going to take too long and the plant's gonna wilt so i try and get like 60 to 80 pictures in the stack and then you rotate it doing 60 to 80 pictures at every point and after 200 of those you know whatever you're left with a ton of pictures uh but then you're you're also running into other issues like it's shooting for 10 hours so you have to keep the plant pristine and not wilting because like it's clearly it's drying out i mean it's like 30 humidity in our garage here being in a really dry so that's another surface area he's a another photographer he's right on the coast oh sorry cut out yeah no sorry someone tried to call me so i had to turn that down sorry please continue no worries uh so i was hanging out with surface area another uh macro photographer and he's right on the coast and we were going back and forth that he had he had a sample set up and i was like you know how long does it stay like that he's like i can shoot it for like a week and it blew me away because mine are drying out immediately like i did a time lapse of 48 hour dry out and it was just gone so the climate really really has a a huge effect on what you can do and you gotta kind of fiddle with you know making the best shot possible with the where you're at do a lot of your clients also ask you to shoot hash because like when you came out and shot with us you know you're experimenting with the jams it kept running off your tool are you mostly doing flour because i think that's obviously where you you know made your namesake but what about hash you shoot a lot of that as well i have um not nearly as much as as flower um it's it's kind of a joke with hashmakers like they don't really want me to shoot it because you see everything even if it's like the best hash ever you're gonna find like one stock or one little speck of plant material or something it's just you know it happens um so it's kind of a joke but uh most you know hash is really fun to shoot um again it's really tricky because it can grease up with with the temperature if it's too high and it's all strain dependent so some strains are a lot more stable than others sometimes you shoot a stack and it's it ends up being a time lapse of it greasing or like you know it's with the jams like you said they're so runny that if you try and do a stack it's like blobs out yeah um i've heard of some interesting like ways of using cold to try and limit that but i'm still experimenting with that i haven't haven't nailed that yet um so it's you know it's it's really interesting it's never never the same there's so much variation it's always a challenge to try and nail it and get the shot no that that's awesome and after this interview we're gonna start posting some of those pics and videos that you took with us so everyone can tune in and see some of the macros uh that eric took for us cool that that's really cool see we're really excited to share that so i've got a list of some questions on here and if anyone who's tuned in has a burning question you can ask it there's a little question box right at the bottom down there i'll try and get through some of those but i think what probably a lot of people don't understand is how much you actually understand about trichomes and cannabis i mean what are some of the biggest things you've learned about cannabis after doing macro photography for so long i mean you you must know so much about the plant itself seeing it at that level it's it's really interesting how how much i've learned over over the years like starting out i wasn't i didn't have access to like pristine cannabis like i would just go to the dispensary pick up dry flowers with my own money and shoot them when i got home um the first many years of uh shooting cannabis was for me and at that point there's a lot of damage that's happened like it's been handled it's been trimmed it's been in a bag it's been shaken up in the dispensary this was back in the medical days where it wasn't pre-packaged um and in oregon it's still like that so it's pretty awesome but uh but yeah you'd zoom in and you'd get headless stocks and you'd get trichomes that are smashed on other trichomes and popped and like i it was hard to tell what was going on um it was just kind of a mess and then once once i got to shoot live streams got the try they're all shriveled up and um really started putting things in perspective oh you back yeah looks like it looks like you have a little connection issue but it looks good now okay any luck looks like we're having uh some technical difficulties here how's your wi-fi doing are you uh at a good connection point here let me if you want uh you could also potentially okay yeah i can hear you okay now i'm going to turn off the wi-fi on my computer it shouldn't be doing anything but that should be better all right where did that i think you were just talking about how when you really got into the macro photography of those original buds you were shooting is kind of like a debris field there is a lot of damage and that's i think where things cut off well well thanks everyone for beard with us uh it might be instagram here not sure how you doing on your head hey it sounds like it's okay yeah let's try this one more time uh can you hear me okay yeah i can hear you now okay you're looking good uh let's give this another shot um yeah i guess continue with your explanation about you know those kind of the buds you were seeing that were damaged and what you learned from that so it was hard to tell what was going on with uh with what i was seeing once i finally got to see the live stuff uh you could clearly see what were where where things were supposed to be and uh it put what i was seeing on the dry stuff in perspective so like stringers uh schwall another macro photographer coined that um when you'd see like a popped head and like strings of resin coming across and uh schweil was really one of the first people that i was bouncing ideas off of and like here's a picture i got of this what do you think's going on and kind of enough of back and forth of that with trail and other photographers and um more pictures added to to the library you know it kind of started to put things into perspective um and now like i've seen so much it's it's really interesting to compare the traits of different strains of different growing techniques it's it's crazy there's so much diversity out there and like there's long trichomes there's thick trichomes i've seen like candy cane like spiraling trichome stocks like the colors are different you got purples coming up from the bottom purples in the heads i just saw on my post the other day i was gonna ask about that purple's in the middle of the stop just like little splotches and that's the first time i'd ever seen that uh i've seen heads that are shaped like beans they're like not round they're like elongated down the sides there's double uh double headed double stopped triple headed triple stock trichomes like i personally haven't seen a triple headed triple stock trichome but i've seen pictures and it's on my uh i gotta find one now um the doubles took a while to find but once once i found my first one uh you kind of start seeing them everywhere um so you know who knows what we're gonna find next but it's it's super interesting to kind of explore and um and just see what's out there yeah no that that's really cool so in your most recent post and i've got a bunch of trichome questions for you because i've been following your work for a long time what did you discover with that rare purple strain and let's talk a little bit more about the anthocyanins you said you picked up some granddaddy perps way long time ago and it was purple it blew your mind what did you see with that rare strain and why was that purple unique in your most recent post so it's it's the the cells in the trichome head itself that we're turning purple so you get that like little pink polka dotted uh look in the heads um and that's what is super rare um i've only seen it on a couple of other strains there's only four that i can think of uh purple pakistani chitral by green body uh oregon diesel um blood drive and i think there's one other one oh yeah and star pupil um so it's just it's something that i'd seen uh schwall is actually the first one that i've seen it on his instagram um and i was like i gotta find this it's just it's just a super rare thing um it's it's almost like i need to shoot more to know for sure but it could be the same cells that are turning amber uh at the end of the growing process like when everybody's like oh you gotta have amber trichomes it's it's not actually the head itself that's turning amber it's those cells in the base of the head and then it's because the cell or the trichome head is just a giant uh basically magnifying glass that those amber cells in the base when you look at it from the top down it just looks like the whole head is yellow or amber yeah so okay so this is it's it's awesome that you're answering that because that was going to be another one of my questions is that as to dispel the myth and to educate everyone who's tuned in correct me if i'm wrong here but after seeing your work and reading your posts the trichomes themselves do not actually turn amber it's the cells at the bottom of the head of the stock that change color and then the light refracts through them changing it from clear to opaque to amber is that what you're saying that's basically what what and i don't want to say like that's for sure what's going on because you know the more pictures we take the more we learn but from what i've seen with my pictures at the times that i've shot those particular strains that's what i'm deserving um and the same the cloudy aspect is another one that i'm not exactly sure what's going on it could be the cells in the bottom are changing in some way that refracts through the head and makes it look cloudy uh it could actually be turning cloudy on some of the heads when you look at them up close you can see little like soap bubbles um like i don't know what those are but they look like like inside the trichome itself you're saying like little air pockets or resin pockets it looks more like it's on the outer surface of the head um i don't know a better way to describe it than like that just like some are big some are small it's like kind of just interspersed like all the way around the base of the head um not those those cells like it's clearly in the head itself um but it's there and i don't know when it shows up or if it's like a strain dependent thing um but it looks super cool yeah well and and speaking of swale is that how you pronounce his handle pretty sure okay yeah uh ryan and i were uh wondering on monday when i did the instagram live with him you know he's put out some photography about the weakness trichomes and you know he's done some work trying to figure out solventless friendly trichomes kind of like some of the work we're doing with you have you had any of your other clients trying to dig into that are there any other characteristics that people who are tuning in should try and look for in a plant when they are trying to wash it or process it solventlessly that i i don't know i think it's still a little early on um i've got to say i love the work trail's doing with with pinpointing those like those traits and shooting them because it's hard to get those too like you got to find the exact right angle so you can see that kind of separation from the head and i've definitely seen that on on other strains i've shot um i wouldn't say it's something that's super common but but yeah it's really interesting for stuff like that other people notice it in the community and then like you know we start other photographers start looking for it and start seeing stuff it's it's really cool like that there's so many photographers out there now doing this thing and exploring and um especially with like like sani seeds is another one i don't know if you follow him he does some insane work with uh microscope objectives and he's doing some like uv um macros now where like stuff inside the triangle that is glowing it's crazy uh wow yeah so i want to pick up a uv flashlight or figure out how some way to do that um and explore that because that's something i've never never explored um just super fascinating stuff so who are some other photographers in the space that you know you've been inspired by or that you would recommend people follow you know we're all about you know giving credit to other people in the industry and you know making the industry a better place like who who's inspired you and who should people follow i know i'm going to forget some people i wish i had a list that's okay there's there's so many um i mean swale uh things from stein farms candid kush uh surface area um sandy seeds um my newer guy but he's one of my friends that lives in bend someone just said doobie duck in the chat doobie ducks and og uh robert clark um todd mccormick um beer goggles is another one that uh he's an og he's been doing macros for a long time and also a super talented hashmaker uh awesome let's see oh man uh mr x strain hunter is another one that's been doing some insane uh macro work with objectives um like long exposures with objectives like 100x stuff then i'm like it's like melting my brain trying to figure out how he's doing some of this stuff same with sandy seeds um yeah when you say a macro objective what what does that term mean educate me because i don't really know for sure so basically a it's a it's a microscope lens so it's like okay it's designed it's just called an objective it's just designed for going on a microscope and there's without getting too technical there's a couple different types of microscope objectives that are optically set up for different types of microscopes and basically i just have one that works with my lens so you can just screw it on the front of the lens set it at 200 millimeters and uh it just works as if it's on a microscope um and then you have to shoot like it's with like my 20x uh you need like 50 to 100 sometimes more pictures just to get one trichome head in focus uh with the 50x it's sometimes up to like 400 pictures to get a tricom head in focus um it gets kind of insane wow that i mean that sounds really intense so there's obviously still a ton to learn and that you and some other photographers are like really pushing the boundaries right now yeah i mean i i'm not pushing the boundaries on the microscope side as much as some of these other guys are it's really cool to see and it's really inspiring me too like like with the uv stuff i i want to get to get on that well what do you think you know there's so much left to learn obviously but what do you think we're gonna learn from this kind of photography over the next five to ten years i mean clearly we've learned a lot already but do you have any insights or any future predictions about where cannabis you know macro photography is going to go that's a tough one i i don't know um i mean the first thing that's popping into my head is like what's whale's doing with the looking at the heads that are more likely to to break off in a solventless sense um i mean seeing stuff like that uh maybe maybe some interesting like like with uh with that star pupil with there's actually purple or pink little dots in the heads uh i would assume that's going to make pink hash because it that those pink colors are actually in the heads um so seeing stuff like that like when there's interesting colors coming out in the hash um that could be a great avenue for for seeing what's going on um i don't know it's going to be interesting behold i'm i'm just ready for it no that's awesome uh i am super excited as well i'm gonna go ahead and start sprinkling in a couple questions in here from the audience i've been blabbing on for a while and again said this at the beginning for everyone who's tuned in we got eric nugeshotz with us premier cannabis macro photographer dude's a legend uh if you can't catch the full episode make sure to watch it on instagram after this we'll have it up and on youtube in a week or two so if you didn't catch the whole thing make sure to listen to it tons of good info in here so rosin evo's asking what's your what's been your favorite strange shoe that's a great question oh man that's so tough um first pops into my head is gmo just because the heads are so resilient like i remember the first time i shot it i like just touching the heads you can really feel the differences like some are greasy some are sticky the gmo that i shot was like sandy like you could feel the heads not popping in your hands like after just touching the live plant and wow that translated to most of the trichomes like all of the trichomes being perfectly intact on the plant which is something that's really tricky um because i mean it trichomes are super fragile the plant has to grow for four months uh those trichomes have to be untouched during that whole time i mean if a bug lands on it potentially it could pop up so yeah the really resilient trichome heads um just makes makes the photography a lot easier on my end so that's probably also why gmo has been an absolute staple strain in our community in the solventless community because it washes so well and it's probably because of that trichome resiliency they're not breaking down and you had a video it was a while ago where you were poking trichomes i remember with a pen and then just explode can you tell us a little bit about that video and i'll keep rolling on some questions yeah for sure so that one um that was actually a t-pin um and it it was it looks really sharp when you're holding it in your hand into the frame it just looks like a blunt stick or something like it's it's not sharp anymore but yeah but yeah just touching the trichome head with that piece of metal just made it pop like a water balloon like poking it with a pin it just it's gone um a couple other interesting things that i noticed when doing that was once you have resin on the front of that pin it doesn't pop heads anymore that resin protects it it it didn't pop as easily i mean you can still get it to pop but it kind of just it it was a lot more resilient uh you could also push i pushed heads into each other and the heads didn't pop they just kind of bumped up against each other squished a little bit and came back apart it was fine thought that was super fascinating um which probably explains why the plants can survive wind outdoors and uh and still be able to be shot you know really really pristinely at the end of the season um so those those are probably the two key takeaways from that uh but yeah they're super super fragile if they're not touching each other yeah that's crazy and that just makes me think because i've seen a lot of you know not a lot there's some macro photography out there of cbd trichomes and i'd love to learn if you've shot much of that but you've got a lot of cbd plants that are like field hemp being grown in greenhouses at best sometimes not a lot of cbd being grown inside and those trichomes are like ultra tiny and they're not the bulbous head you know i think it's i forget bulbous head tri capitate stock i'm getting my terms wrong here but it's like all these super refined indoor strains that have these giant delicate trichomes but then your cbd strains maybe because they've been outside and they endure more abuse they have to have smaller tougher trichomes i know i'm just kind of theorizing do you shoot a lot of cbd i haven't honestly i've shot a little bit of hemp but it wasn't uh wasn't super macro um that's that's something i definitely want to explore more um i actually read years ago that cbd shows up more amber in trichome i don't know if that's true or not but that was one of the things that i read that kind of piqued my interest about shooting hemp or cbd dominant strains i shot a couple that were dry that it kind of looked like that was true but that was a long time ago and it could have just been taken really long or sat there oxidizing for a while like who knows what actually made them amber um but yeah that's that's definitely something i want to explore in the future yeah we you know are really learning a lot about cbd heavy strains um and i think as ghee row court from pop and barkley took pains to point out that hemp and cannabis they're the same thing they're just divergent lineages of the same plant so i'll be really curious you know if you start posting stuff about cbd you know if you ever get a chance to shoot some of that please tag us because we'd love to see it because a lot of the cbd strains they sift really well but they don't wash really well and uh it's it's a little bit of a mix up and again those trichomes are like 10 to 20 microns high whereas the i feel like a lot of the trichomes that you shoot on these like gorgeous plants they're like a hundred plus you know for those first washes those first poles they're so much bigger on these like premier thc strains yeah that's i mean that do you notice like in the hash uh because you you're using different screens and stuff like can you see the distribution of the head size like trending smaller versus the thc strains it's a great question i wish i could answer that maybe foxtrax who's in here and who we've had on the show who uh is one of my go-to cbd experts man if you've got any comments on the size of the cbd trichomes being different please comment because i'm sure everyone would love to learn a little bit about that but yeah that that's pretty cool um i'm gonna go ahead here got a little off track but that was really cool uh let's see oh man there's there's so many in here all right so we talked about one of your favorite cultivars to shoot what about one to smoke what kind of strains are you smoking on personally lately uh and and do you grow just to tack on to this you know how what what is your personal cannabis preferences what do they look like so i like uh the fruitier kind of strains skittles the forbidden fruits the tropicana cookies that kind of stuff i love um also the gassy side i've been really loving uh deadhead og lately uh i mean og's in general always always classic um gmo of course uh the gassy size just gotta have the gassy side um and as far as growing i've grown a little bit in the past um i've got a couple outdoor plants growing right now um got a little back not great but kind of gets shade half the day so um i'm going to make hash with them this year uh first time trying that um and then i'm stoked i got the press because that's where it's really going to come in handy um with my little outdoor outdoor grow so i'm not expecting much but i've got some uh some squirt in there i popped some of those from feed from humboldt seed company that one um is blueberry muffin by tangi oh that sounds good man stain orange terps that's another one that they found humble team company found at the megafino hunt along with the vanilla frosting and it's just unbelievable um it's it's kind of in the range of like the forbidden fruit and uh chopped cookies but it's kind of got like slightly different orange terp on it i saw it uh there was one farm that had it at the emerald cup i want to say last last year and uh it was unbelievable so i'm really hoping that that strain blows up if you uh if you come across that one definitely check it out okay i will and uh let us know when you start pressing some rosin on your helix how it starts coming out have you have you made any rosin on it so far yeah definitely like just with what guns i've got sitting around um and i mean the final rosin's good it's cool to try and uh figure it out like what temperature presses best with what strain definitely had a lot like kind of burnt tasting [Laughter] i'm really excited to get the like get the hash in there although i'm not expecting too much because it'll be my first time but um hopefully it comes out half decent um maybe i can find somebody with a with a freeze dryer that let me uh please try my stuff but yeah i bet there's a lot of people who are tuned in and i would love to help you out so that's cool can't wait to check out some of what you can post there i'm going to try and get through a couple more of these because i don't want to leave too many out there here's one that i think we can answer pretty easily have you tried to take photos of a press in progress i have seen it personally um it's on your feed or was it somewhere else where where have i seen it yes it's on i'm pretty sure it's one of the early posts on eric nugshot speed and funny story with that uh rosin evolution who uh was the first question uh he was one of the early guys that got me into solvent lists and uh he was i did that uh the first press video where it was actually a time lapse um but we basically set up this giant rosin press in my living room in san diego and it was there for like a week um my uh girlfriend at the time my fiance now she was not happy and she was actually the other day but uh but the pictures came out insane um it was the first time that i tried like a little um like hit so press and then like move the other side i'm back i'm sorry the owners were calling me but they get declined because we're busy right now so anyway please continue yeah so uh so basically it started on one side of the press and then would move to the other side um the press ended and it was really it we we did it so many times to try and get the waterfall coming out like right in the middle and finally nailed it and it it just looked insane it's one of my favorite shots i've done but now it would be really cool to try it again because i've got 4k video now whereas back then it was just stills and it was just taking flash pictures all the way through and you're missing a lot of that you can't slow it down it's just happening really fast because it's a timeline um i'd love to try that stuff again with video yeah well we'll have to figure something out and have you out again because you know there's so much that's going on with hash and rosin right now it seems like flowers are maybe a little easier a little more consistent to shoot whereas like you were saying earlier with hash consistencies are changing more quickly than the plants and when you're pressing it it's like it's moving i mean i'm not a photographer but that sounds really difficult yeah it's yeah yeah the life is probably a lot easier to shoot but it's also where my experience lies like there's a lot of these guys out there that are that focus on shooting concentrates and they do it a lot better than me and i hope to get to their level uh at some point but it's just a matter of trial and error and figuring figuring out the techniques that work best to limit that that greasing or whatever is going on like the jam is one that i gotta figure out how to shoot that better um and so if you had like a bowl if you had like um like a shallow dish that was semi-translucent i wonder if it would have the right surface tension to sit there because in the photo that you took on the flat piece you know it's almost like a bubble i don't just throw ideas at you i don't know if they'll work or not i was going for like on that picture you're talking about it's like the end of a dabber and i kind of got the surface tension to keep it in a little bubble uh on the end of the dabber but it's like it's not a very interesting picture it's just like a dome and you can kind of some of the crystals in there um but i just i like the one like like the tropicana one we did where it's kind of like a little bubble sitting on top of there you can kind of see into some of those crevices where it's like really juicy those ones i like a lot more now that's cool and just for everyone again eric took some really great shots with us we need to get some of those out uh super excited i'll share those soon we got tons of good ones um okay let's see man some of these are really long questions um cool how do you feel about this is a little off the hash cannabis topic uh do you have any lighting that you like i know and for everyone who is tuning in a little late watch the whole episode eric gave a great explanation on equipment uh but what about lighting just to change topics real quick yeah so biggest uh well there's a couple things i can say on lighting uh first of all a flash if you're trying to get really really in there with macro flash is probably the best thing you can get because it's a lot of light you're blasting it with light and at the macro level you need a ton of light uh in order to get things to show up or you need to do a long exposure if you're doing constant light and the problem with macro is that there's a ton of vibration any little movement can cause the camera to vibrate even uh if you got an slr even the mirror just moving out of the way to start the picture wow everything off um so i'm really excited to get a mirrorless at some point to get rid of that but the other the other side of lighting is diffusion um and that's probably the biggest tip is that i can give is diffuse your light whether that's through a soft box or honestly just putting a piece of paper in front of your flash uh basically if you want to picture it as like a sunny day versus a cloudy day on a sunny day you're going to have super harsh like a defined line where your shadows are where a cloudy day all the shadows are soft the sun is diffused through the cloud you can just get an a much nicer uh nicer lit scene so i'd say diffusion is probably the best uh if you can use a flash that's another another super key key tip okay no that's great and that reminds me because when i was a groomsman at a friend's wedding a long time ago it was completely cloudy and i asked the photographer i was like how hard are these pictures going to be to take he's like no this is literally perfect i like a cloudy day to shoot so the diffusion is key for everyone who's tuned in here that is awesome um and then let's see we've already got there are some funny ones in here that i'm gonna skip um okay cool all right let's let's try this we i think you've pretty much already answered this but just for everyone who's tuning in late just to go kind of go over how many photo stacks when you're making an image when you zoom in like you see on ig because i think that's kind of what really when i saw that that first one where there's the thing and you're zooming in on it on the plant like that's when i kind of had this holy [ __ ] moment following you how many stacks did those take did you say 15 to 20 are you talking the the hyper zoom where it's like yeah it was all the way into the trichomes at the top yeah that was not actually stacks um there's no stacks in that the and you can kind of get away with it because it's moving so there's always something new coming in and out of focus so the the super shallow depth of field isn't as important um but it's still like this if i could stack those and i want to try eventually but it's just so much longer time investment and the plant is wilting so you gotta you gotta shoot those as quick as possible um so basically it's just a series of uh of 360s and then uh i'll zoom in a little bit do another one and then repeat that process all the way in to the macro level and then i'll combine them all in after effects after the fact so that's a lot of post-production um probably the vast majority of the work on those is editing in the computer manually aligning differences between uh between zoom levels and just trying to make it look as perfect as possible and sometimes you can get it perfect other times you really i spent days just making small changes trying to get it to blend perfectly um i'm a perfectionist so i agonize over that stuff uh probably to a fault but but i i don't know i i gotta be proud of it before i'll let it out so sometimes it takes forever yeah that's crazy and you know so many of the hashmakers that we've had on the show and it's great to mix it up with you you know a photographer that they are obsessed with their crap so how much time would you say is shooting versus post is it 50 50 mostly post i mean how does that time split work when you go do a shoot with somebody i would say so on the normal stuff like the stuff that i normally shoot like the 360 livestocks and like the standard one-shot macros well stat you shoot 400 pictures you end up with one shot are i'd say there's more time shooting maybe uh actually it's maybe 50 50. uh there's just a lot of time waiting for stuff to render so it's like i just let it go and my computer is working but i'm not necessarily working on it so it's probably for those on the hyper zooms it's probably i mean i'm getting better at them but it's still a lot more editing time uh the first one took me six months to edit holy [ __ ] just because i i i would i would come back to it i would play with it for a little while i couldn't get it to work and then i'd like get fed up and drop it for a little while and then i'd come back in a week or two and try it again couldn't get it and then finally after six months of trying i got it um and then past that have taken a lot less time but it's still weeks sometimes months like if it goes together quickly then then it's good but if i'm like just constantly fiddling with trying to get that transition perfect because the biggest thing is once when you're in the macro level and you're zooming in more your your depth of field is getting cut in half so when you're blending between things that have like half as much in focus as the first set it gets really tricky you can really see where that transition is so it's it's a it's finding where that perfect point is where the trichome comes into focus in one and goes out of focus on the other and you can blend them perfectly together and when it works it works so sometimes it doesn't wow well i'm just seeing the comments right now everyone is just going damn like that's so much work so you okay so just so everyone to kind of sum that all up a ton of post work has gone into this and especially it sounds like the learning process i mean was there any time that you like hit a breakthrough like when you nailed that zoom or where there was a moment where you're like okay i think i've really taken a big leap forward here is it a lot of experimentation with your software and your camera yeah it's definitely a lot of experimentation i would say that when when that first hyper zoom like really came together it was like a super big moment for me because it had been like six months of struggling with this thing and not giving up um and honestly like that was that was the last last really big one that i figured out like pretty much all on my own i wouldn't say it's all my own because like i watched some tutorials on youtube about how to do hyper zooms and kind of applied those to my own process and stuff um then video macro started doing the stacked spins and totally inspired me but i didn't want to like hit him up and be like yo how'd you do that uh try it myself first and after i tried it a couple times and kind of got it i hit him up and was like yo like you don't want to nerd out a little bit bounce some tips back and forth and he was super helpful and gave me a couple things that really took this the next level so i got to give a lot of credit to him on those stack spins um and if you guys don't follow video macro i highly recommend it i think i forgot to mention him before and i also forgot to mention dave's not here man he's in a great yeah he's in he's with us right now i've been following uh him for a while he does a lot of great photos locally but do you do any shooting like outside of canvas i'm sure you do a ton like dave does a bunch of hummingbird stuff which i've got a little hummingbird theater right on my patio and i watch them all the time and they're fascinating are there any other photo subjects that you're particularly keen on outside of cannabis i've been really diving into the astrophotography lately um i i've done a lot of photography in the past before coming to cannabis i was uh the assistant photo editor at my college newspaper did a bunch of photojournalism um had a little press pass that would like get me past the the fire lines when we had fires in in la so like got to go in past where everybody was allowed and shoot fires which was super cool um i was doing uh off-road racing photography for a while um right outside of high school me and my buddy would go out to all the races um in the desert we'd go down to the baja 1 500 and just take pictures he would shoot video we had a little night where we'd sell prints and we put together a dvd um but but yeah now astro photography is is my kind of side thing that i'm playing with and it's it's really similar because it's i've got a star tracker um with kind of like the focus stacking rig it basically counters the rotation of the earth so the stars stay in the same place in the frame and don't move only if you just put your camera on a tripod you're going to get star trails if you do longer um so it's really similar with the precision needed for macro like i have to align it perfectly with the north star uh and actually that's not even true because the north star is like just slightly off of where the actual north pole uh where ever gonna have to adjust to exactly that whole um so it's it's really interesting like doing long exposures and if there's a stacking element too to uh to reduce noise um you gotta have your camera like perfectly aligned or the stars are gonna move and then it's also the invisibility aspect of it like shooting andromeda you physically can't see it until you do like a three-minute long exposure and then this galaxy comes out on the back of your camera it's it's mind-blowing so i'm i'm really nerding out on that right now um that's awesome and i'm sure it's extra interesting after you've taken a good dab or two and you can get out there and stare through your camera yeah just just sitting there staring up at the sky for hours on end it's great that's awesome that's that's great so we've got about five minutes left uh last reminder here with eric nug shots make sure to watch the full episode on instagram afterwards or on our youtube channel um eric where can people find you and your work i'm sure most people here are following you and do you sell merch or anything i i'm really slacking on the merge side of things i i need to get on that um i'm working on a print site um so that's that's hopefully coming really soon i was really hoping to get him before this podcast so i could drop that but it's coming soon i'll announce that when uh when it's when it's up um but pretty much just instagram right now is is the the place if people want to dm me i try and get back to everybody um it's sometimes it's really hard so if i don't get back to you try again but uh but yeah instagram eric.net shots and the uh at nodeshots account we're starting to post there again too cool so if i had to grow and i was interested in having you come out and doing some photography for me do you travel out and you know kind of like the services we were talking about is that how you usually get booked up or what what's your game plan for people that might want to employ your services here yeah pretty much just shoot me a dm or shoot me an email erik nugshots.com and uh and we can go from there pretty much if you can give me like a month that's usually ideal uh but you know if something comes up quicker and i got some time i'll try and make it happen um yeah i love being on the road you know if i got to drive 16 hours to get to you it's all good okay yeah that's a nice long drive so my last question for you is for everyone who's tuned in who wants to be a better cannabis photographer or is trying to learn what tips or advice do you have in the remaining couple minutes we have here to pass on for people that are trying to get into it or trying to improve their craft i guess just keep messing around um you just got to kind of make mistakes and figure out why those mistakes happened and correct for them like like for me it was just that that was pretty much all it was i would just start messing around something wouldn't work out i would try and figure out what went wrong and then repeating that process over and over and over and over again gave me a really strong background and macro and i mean just photography in general like i've i've been doing that with a bunch of different aspects of photography over the years so it's kind of all just compiled down so i just say just keep keep being creative uh and just keep messing around and just figuring stuff out and also there's a ton of photographers out there now doing this like i was one of the early one of the only ones i had swale to bounce ideas back and forth with um but now there's a huge community of photographers and uh everyone's really cool and we're happy to answer questions uh we're not gonna hold your hand through everything but if you you have that that drive and you're putting out good work and and you're just stuck on something like hit us up and and we're happy to help no that okay well that's awesome uh for everyone who's trying to do it that's great advice and it also mirrors a lot of the advice that we've gotten from the hashmakers on the show who say that you know they have screwed up so many batches and it's taken them so long to get there that just you know keep working hard and don't give up so okay awesome um much of a fight losing a whole a bunch of hash yeah right and and just for everyone who's tuned in here at the end eric said that he's been doing this for what about 11 years now going on 12. yeah cannabis specifically 10 years and then photography in general probably 20. yeah so it takes a long time to get there and just like dave said in the comments it's a long process so it's pretty much gonna kick us off here in about a minute so i just want to thank you for coming on the show if anyone wants to get eric's awesome skills at their lab for their grow make sure to d him dmm excuse me on instagram or hit him up eric with a k at nookshots.com was that right yep okay awesome so get in touch uh thanks for joining us we will have this episode up soon and next week's guest is going to be colin palmer with vessel life sciences great dude great hashmaker we got a lot of cool guests coming up too so thank you eric i really appreciate you coming on thank you all right cool i'll talk to you later man all right [Music] you", "rrJusIHryxo": "[Music] so [Music] you guys around good morning everybody welcome to the green room we're still stuck in legislative session okay i apologize it's going on week three now of the same time no seriously two months there's only two months of sessions i know in the state of florida it's unique um state legislators they only meet two months out of the year and it's usually around the february time frame february march time frame or march april time frame so everything gets crunched into these two months so you have bills that are introduced like hundreds of them because these legislators go back to their district and their constituents for you know basically 10 months and then for two months they sit in tallahassee and then vote on all these bills and all these bills like the one for medical marijuana which is a ludicrous bill comes up and they debate it and a lot of times there's not enough time for rebuttal even or properly handled rebuttal just because of the two-month time frame and so as you know dr barry was in tallahassee a week ago and he got 30 seconds after after someone um representative roach had two hours to present why people shouldn't should have caps on medical cannabis and so today there's another session at 9 30 in front of a new committee going on at 9 30 but a very well organized rebuttal this time as a news conference at 12 o'clock held by a lot of providers so this is exciting news for us that at least like someone like dr barry and the people of his caliber who see who have boots on the ground will actually address some of the issues of this build because otherwise those voices do not get heard properly in the chamber of the legislators um yeah so that's that's right that is right believe it or not texas only meets every other year well yeah unregulated state as they like this yeah yeah just take your gun and go yeah so we do so we're in the two month legislative session you know today's and just to give everybody an update so nothing has passed yet no not yet right and very important in florida the house and the senate have to have matching bills at the end of the session that then go to or whenever it happens that then they go to the governor for significant challenges hurdles right a lot of hurts we're hoping that the senate you know will do what they've done in the past listen everybody we fought this thc cap but this bill's worse and we'll talk about it too much but the point is we fought off the thc cap the past two years already last year just for pediatrics but you know the point is we are very much more so organized you know today and i am excited about the news conference at noon but you know but again like the thing that that upsets me is one they don't listen to the providers that are boots on the ground they don't listen to patients in their families who are truly affected by this on a daily basis over half a million patients over a half a million people in this state use medical cannabis and you have kids who are uh epileptic and having seizures that this assist them all of a sudden they're wanting to take certain things away even for pediatrics and we can address that they want to you know have very low doses and then you have to get medical sign off by two doctors which they have already and they're not trusting the physicians and i think the most insulting thing from that roach was i'm sorry representative that somebody wrote from the roach from that roach was how how disgraceful and and how nasty he was towards the medical profession saying he doesn't trust them they've done pill mills in the past that those cannabis physicians are going to do exactly the same thing and just are all horrible so let's talk about today's committee meeting so so what happened was so it passed the first hurdle in that house committee last week so it's got to go through three different committees today's committee is a different committee now he's going to be many of the same people carlos guillermo smith our championship but let's have the big butt in the big elephant in the room our legislator and our senate are very republican held and they tend to vote down party lines they did that very clearly last week well they did and you know we're in the green room we try to keep it nonpartisan [Music] and the fact that those legislators are voting down party lines and this is the green room this is not appropriate for them they should look at their constituents look at patients look at their this is a health care issue it is not red blue white it's green or what you call it anything else but it is not an and they shouldn't vote on these kinds of don our producer as he always does picked out a wonderful backdrop for us today because the doors are closed see yeah you know i mean that's why this picture is so significant it is this is what bothers me about what's going on in the house so representative roach with all due respect he comes out of he has no respect for me i'm sorry he comes out of inter well he comes out of an addiction he comes out of interdiction he's i think a coast guard jag attorney or whatever and that's his world and what bothers me about it and what i want to see today is this route so you know he already cried out to the press okay finally [Music] okay this is where the democrats picked me up take the high road they take the lord they're in the gutter all the time they like to fight dirty they fight in the mud there's no reason why if this man is insulting you as a physician saying that he thinks he knows better than you beat us and i'm like i'm sorry let's call it out do not respect him he is not a physician he should not be telling patients what to do it is not his right and i'm sorry no i mean that's okay let's face it we don't want anybody threatening anybody's family no you don't cross the line right so it's very important to maintain a certain degree of civility no no you don't join people's family but what i'm interested to see is that this guy actually gets up again and gives the same presentation i'm sure he won if you don't think so and gives the same price it gives the same presentation as last week listen you like to think that people can learn and grow representative roach if you're and don you can cut this one mark the time okay representative roach if you're gonna get up again today and say that cannabis is a schedule one narcotics five times again this morning okay and if you're gonna repeat your vision view words okay then hang on that people are abusing the system the doctors are abusing it and the patients are just getting high causing it to get high you haven't learned anything no he hasn't you haven't listened and that's the problem that's going to be bad yes i agree he needs to listen and then what is he gonna do swallow his words when the feds deschedulize and take it off schedule one when it's not in narcotic because it's not one well it's not come on but the point is you have to understand what's going on here everybody this is oh and listen there's three bills in the committee today okay if you're paying attention everybody and you know i do one of the other bills is giving one hundred thousand dollars are we up down or just because i don't want anybody to miss this a hundred thousand dollars to drug free america so that they can teach us about the dangers or whatever of cannabis and pregnancy now hang on don mark this one too listen here's my suggestion suggestion everybody give it to dr genester wilson king okay my colleague okay who's an ob gyn clinician who does medical cannabis who's written in medical journals about cannabis and women's health and pregnancy issues and things of that nature drug free america really a hundred thousand dollars really i feel like we're back in the nancy reagan days of just saying so here's my point representative roach sits on the drug policy council for the state it goes beyond this everybody who's watching if you haven't watched last week's or oh my god what could this week's hold okay he was connoting cannabis with opiate use that people that use opiates want to use more cannabis and people that use cannabis darn it they're going to end up using those opioids too yeah it was interesting because when carlos guillermo smith said can you just give me a quote of how many can how many of these half million half million patients in the state of florida have overdosed on cannabis oh that would be a zero and how many have passed away from it that would be a zero yet yet for some reason it's like this huge huge cloud over it now that it's just a gateway drug to opioids it is not people are coming off it's an exit ramp as i don't remember who the gentleman was on our show one of the people on our show said it's an off ramp it's an exit drug it's not an on-ramp it's the off-ramp people get off of things because of it so if he's standing in the way on the drug policy council of a legitimate discussion about how cannabis can be utilized okay appropriately listen it's a substance and let's get down to where all this comes from right now okay this is all i'm smart i finally figured out what sam means it's smart approaches to marijuana okay that's kevin sabette and patrick kennedy okay drug free america based right here in saint pete they're the ones that are driving this everybody on a national on a national um landscape now okay national stage you're gonna start to see that because they've lost the legalization battle and they have okay and they have now they're morphing into cappers okay until we need to minimize danger okay this and that listen everybody adverse events happen with every substance salt sugar caffeine okay right a lot of things kill you and of course cannabis can have an adverse event as well and we're going to get back to in about 20 seconds because it's important to talk about because they always hang their hat on the same flawed studies of psychosis and yeah developing brains and believe me we're concerned about that too as a medical clinic no one's advocating that no one no physician in his right mind him or her are going to jeopardize a medical license are you insane representative roach that any any physician would put their medical license on the line they went to school for eight years and they are not going to put a license on the line i know that the doctors are getting rich listen you know i never go that way because to make it personal but we put our licenses on the line representative roach my dea prescribing exactly okay i mean believe me when i tell you i have a wonderful staff here okay we all are out here with passion practicing with honor and integrity okay medicine medicine medicine let's not confuse legal adult use issues and i think he he is once again he's carrying the the banner of sam and drug free america in this now we need to minimize harm battle now that we've lost the legalization battle how you minimize harm is by education it's education the phys to trust the physicians and their staff to educate patients it and you know what we welcome representative roach not in an argumentative stance come to the clinic we're inviting you we challenge you come to the clinic come see what a patient does when they walk through our door after an hour visit with dr barry and with our educators where you are educated on product educated on adverse reactions educated on the entire plant we challenge you come see us don't don't just make these blankets dumbass statements when you have no clue come on in we challenge you we welcome you we promise you we'll stay you know hands back and we'll just go through as if you're a regular patient in the office and our state senator you know friend joe gruder's has been here before politicians have come through the door come on on the tour with with senator grooter seriously yeah really representative representative roach would be a great you know way to do that and and we invite you to um to come in i think you'd really be surprised when you see the pain and you know what listen doctor stories are doctor stories the news conference is going to be great it's the we're gonna tag representative roche on today's episode obviously so that's why we're referencing speaking to him personally and honestly i have to say i was not an advocate of cannabis until i came to the clinic i still don't have my own card and i'm not i don't use it personally however what i have seen here for patients is truly amazing and the stories and the tears in the desperation when a patient walks through through these doors is incredible and it will shake you and it'll change your life and it will change your opinion because honestly it changed mine and it was just because of what you see as a plant actually helping someone in in a desperation you see these parents crying tears you see patients with cancer crying you see people with tremors in wheelchairs who are in desperation and this gives them relief and it gives them some betterment of their own life and that's all they're looking for you need to come in and see it for yourself and please do not make blanket statements without doing so and i learned my lesson to also keep an open mind because once you open that mind it will change your life and to put a level of anxiety on to the half a million and more now patients in florida over the loss of their medicine 2021 masks haven't gone away a lot of these patients have chronic debilitating illnesses already you can imagine the level of anxiety trying to navigate through covet and now they have this as an animal there's no better things to do in california exactly add this level of anxiety and stress to patients which are who are already the ptsd patient the vet really um for representative roach again he served in the coast guard your fellow people were in other military military branches um overseas who lost limbs and i implore again everybody contact his office tell him this is ridiculous if you're a patient even more so he needs to hear it he's not listening he is not listening because here's the point we need to stop this this year okay we need to stop where we get put on the defensive side of the battlefield every single year we were hoping to come into this session with positivity okay fortunately the group of doctors okay that we meet every other wednesday okay we've been planning and writing letters hoping to get reciprocity state by state that's an amendment in today's bill there's going to be three amendments another one is to increase the card to six years watch that'll be an unfriendly amendment guaranteed okay and and i know carl's guillermo smith is also putting a recommendation in to get rid of basically all that capping of the milligram amounts of thc one of the more subtle you know parts of the bill but and you know believe me all those amendments will fail you know again today you know it's unfortunate but you know this is the thing like why and why is the state are we so far behind other states they're quoting all this research well why don't you go to colorado take a road trip go see what's going on in california places where it's been wrecked and medical for years and now that you've mentioned the word research root it's a really subtle but very important point about this whole thing we stop doing the research on the medicines that we're already using in the state we have ongoing research efforts at six o'clock this afternoon by the way dr michelle weiner dr denise bedeau and uh eric stevens um jenny padron was supposed to be on that too but i know she thinks she's in the hospital right now and i want to give her all the best out to our dear friend jenny down in miami but the conference this afternoon is on the research efforts that are going on in florida right right now so what if we take our medicine away and decrease it and potency and this and then you're going to ruin all this studies representative wrote so we're really not going to find out what we want but i want to get back to my point we were hoping for job protections okay you don't think that bill is going to get a hearing you know we were hoping for expungement now interesting expungement did get a hearing in senate committee and passed unanimously in senate so there's a difference between the house and the senate right now which is really important to know it is but we want to continue our telehealth capabilities one would think that would be an easy thing to be voted on that was viewed an unfriendly amendment in last week's hearing also sickle cell disease okay called an unfriendly amendment last week okay so we were hoping for added qualifying conditions we need nursing home access okay assisted living access when somebody goes into the hospital and they're a cannabis patient they should be able to pull out their cannabis card okay and use that as their medicine in the hospital instead of the percocet or whatever else okay they already called it a medicine once you deemed it a medicine you cannot take it away from a patient who are you to make some people losers some people aren't good losers and you said it already they're vicious if you have examples of bad actors okay that are out there advertising for those outliers really go address those outliers but you have so many physicians who are doing the right thing you have so many patients benefiting from those physicians and what they're doing and so there's advertising restrictions oh yeah now they're doing advertising restrictions because every marijuana clinic wants to attract a kid to come to their clinic oh and we'll have mickey mouse smoking you know a joint like that ever has happened and it's hap is not happening no medical clinic of any merit will ever advocate for children are you crazy so they want all the advertising they want all the advertising to go through the omeuse signage okay it's all gonna be even social media oh yeah social media okay so where are the amendment rights um the first amendment rights freedom of speech and where is all of that going for us as a cannabis industry that you're so restricted on advertising media outlets really are there buyers on the advertising and we know some of them okay believe me let's go after go after those but if you're advertising your clinic in a normal fashion as a medical practice you're not doing it to attract children you're not attracting people to go get high i don't i never see like like if there's some outlier out there perhaps there are and we maybe saw a few of them that are trying to draw that crowd address those people but the bulk of physicians the bulk are not doing that and no doctor in his or her right mind will be targeting children or and that's their big concern is attracting children to cannabis and i just i'm sorry parenting issue it's a yes it is it's not why should it be on the other side if your kid's gonna go get high they're gonna go get high and they're gonna find it on a black market and they're gonna find it on in a black market environment where they're more likely to run into a methamphetamine dealer as well or somebody that has adderall or somebody that has other listen regulation is regulation and and you know it's just that once again we're going to see what's going to happen nationally right which you know there's a lot of misunderstanding about that that all of a sudden it's going to go you know they're going to make decisions in the senate and the more acts going to pass and it's going to be suddenly legal nationally that's going to take care of all the problems of course it's not what that's going to do is it's going to send it back to the states okay for states rights and states decisions really important today everybody thursday again supreme court decisions come out we're still waiting for the joe redner floor groan case to see about the breaking up of the verticals we're still waiting to see the supreme court review on the 2022 ballot issues that may bring quote unquote legal adult use to florida but what i tell my patients and i think everybody needs to know this when it gets the to the legal adult news side or whatever other people call wreck okay legal adult use they're gonna tax the heck out of it you know that that's the only way it's gonna happen i mean there's such a negative attitude about it you know the only way that you know the republicans they're gonna have to hold their nose pretty darn tight while they put that 20 or 25 percent tax good and you know what it's revenue so put it back into education put it into our roadways put it into programs social put it into minority houses building tiny homes giving people something tax it and benefit from it what the hell is wrong with you people other states put it into education and their their systems are flourishing this state is so hell bent on being backwards and i'm sorry for all those republicans if they think their teenage kid isn't going to go to college one day and go try marijuana you did it yourself and you tried it you don't think your kids there was no harm you became a functioning adult you went to college you graduated you're raising your families some people need it as a medicine and that's it it's like come on it's it's it's a substance that's been used for eons it will be used for eons we're stuck in the era of 2021 with a significant pharma mitigated and governmental mitigated prohibition against a simple plant right that's what it is it's a medicinal miracle plant they forget about the juicing capabilities of the cannabis and it's not just smoking it is it's crazy there's so many other pills there's so many other avenues and the majority of our patients the majority of our patients are well our average age patient is 58 years old they're not some teenage kid coming into the clinic and listen the gateway theory representative roach i got it we want to protect society and children you know what as a parent do your job protecting people against themselves okay quite frankly is educational and if you're addicted to alcohol you're addicted to opiates okay much less methamphetamine cocaine you'd want cannabis in with all those substances last week okay i can't wait to watch today to see if you step in that pile of yeah good again no i mean it because you need to learn and if you're going to sit on that drug policy council with these attitudes i'm going to be after you as long as you're in that position because you need to understand what i know as an emergency position this is what i wanted to say last week and i apologize for repeating it i'm dr barry not dr bertha madras okay i've been in the er environment bud i've held the hands of mothers okay while their kids are dying from narcotic overdose i've resuscitated the same addict twice in the same day okay i've seen the rotting teeth of meth i've seen the swollen livers of alcoholism okay i've seen patients vomiting blood and dying okay i've seen cocaine cause arrhythmias and and death okay i've never seen an adverse catastrophic event from cannabis there's adverse events from everything let's be a parent let's be a legislator let's be a teacher but but you need to learn you need to learn where we're at as a society today in 2021 is one where doctors should be leading the way on educating amen and you're stopping me from doing that you're you're standing in the way of a legitimate discussion on your drug policy council about where we need to be in the next five to ten years in this country and it's not on your side where you're holding up your hand and stopping my patients from being educated and appropriately treated so that i can clean up some of this goddamn mess okay that was caused by past generations i agree they're well said so you know that's what i'm people ask me where my passion is and listen here's the other side my passion all also comes from sitting in this office every day now and being on the other side and see but that's the thing come see the patients come see the hear the stories see the patients walking through this door and like you said or go hang out in an er representative roach where you are going to see i could arrange that too yeah let's have them go to different styles yeah i do too in the trauma center of smh come on out why don't you come see what really is the opioid problem what the alcoholism problem all of those the meth problems are don't compare that to medical cannabis all you have to do is spend spend a couple days in the er or the trauma center and spend a couple days here and you'll see the difference and then speak don't speak out of your ass of some stupid study that was done like a hundred years ago and that's all you got there's pressure he's got pressure from sam and drug free america okay okay those are his donors president prison i'm sorry to accomplish i'm gonna start and representative roach i am gonna go do a little research on where you get your donor donations from because if there is a tie-in to private prisons there's your answer and then we're done and there's some nurses so follow the money trail because there's a money trail behind him too prison industrial complex drug free america donating somebody there there's alcohol tobacco donations you know i mean the the fuel the fuel to the anti-can to the anti-cannabis movement you know has different tentacles too oh it does it does and there's groups and lobbyists who are veterans are gonna die and and the veterans i hope the veterans come out in droves and keep bombarding the legislators with the need to stop this well you know it's a very interesting session of course because of covid and we'll see who's up there today i think there will be a few positions up there i think at night who wants to go be up there and be insulted yeah be insulted for two hours and then get 30 seconds as an md as a rebuttal it isn't it is insulting and shame shame on the legislators shame on you but i do want to give a big shout out to friend ron watson who was with us last week of course who was up there still doing that eric stevens up there this week listen some of the bigger bigger medical cannabis groups in the state also up there this week lobbying and doing this and i thank them for all that we all are working i know john morgan john morgan's doing a lot of job morgan gets on our news conference today i mean that would add a couple of eyes i doubt it no but he's pushing i mean his web page his facebook page he's pushing pushing forward he is he's pushing back hard because again well he has also a personal story behind it of his brother so people who are uh touched by medical cannabis those are where the passion comes for this plant uh it is and again i wish i just wish they would open their ears a little bit and listen and just listen to the patients and listen to the need and again if you've deemed it in medicine it's no different than somebody taking something that you're dependent on like i said your coumadin your lizard and whatever you're on it's the same thing it's a medicine and you cannot start playing with somebody's medicine you cannot they've been on it for three years you have a half million patients on this this is insanity and it's it's just inappropriate yeah let's see how today goes you know this is the second of three it is that that's gonna be that representative roach gets a chance to you know soil himself again or maybe start to kind of edge closer to some degree of understanding okay you know be rude i'm an inclusionist my our door and i know you invited him i do too our door is always open so i'm hoping to see a little bit of positive today i am i know it's going to fail excuse me go through the house of course our you know it'll we know that we just want to see something representative wrote show me that you're learning okay and for those who are watching our show um at 9 30 this morning tune in to the florida channel if you want to start screaming at a tv because you missed those days because since the last election and you really want to get your blood pressure up and want to start yelling and screaming tune into the florida channel today and watch the session because it will make your blood boil and we hope it does and then i we hope that you and all your friends that have been touched by medical cannabis start making phone calls to the state legislature they're making a difference by the way everybody believe that those phone calls make a huge difference petition believe me they have to listen to their constituents at the end of the day they really do do we have a question you just said i will have to leave florida if this evil bill passes how dare you politicians think that you are physicians no thc caps yeah no thc caps plp no and for those if you couldn't hear what um don just read out it's a comment we just got on our our live feed from a patient saying they would have to leave this state so i mean this is a because it's a their medicine so please take this seriously it's a terrible commentary no but it's a true this is a true commentary so this is live on our feed right now it just came through this is why please watch the florida channel at 9 30 afterwards find out who your legislator is please call them bombard them with phone calls bombard them with emails make it known that this is something you're against because they have to listen they have to and it's a matter of not of life indefinite to a degree but in to the degree it is because this is something that people have been on for three years and now you're changing their medicine and it's just inappropriate so let's fight on and listen next week i guarantee you we'll be back with an update on what happened today yeah here's the good news everybody two months in florida so we're going to be vigilant pay attention every day even if this goes down in the senate and hopefully it will they're going to try to put it in some other bill later in the session probably in the last week of the session they're not going to go away so we need to remain vigilant uh every single day a session says tune in to florida channel 9 30 and we'll catch you next thursday right now in the news conference at noon news conference i don't know who's going to be broadcasting yeah it'll be i guarantee you'll be on the florida channel thanks everybody beautiful yeah nice yeah all the frustrations", "ryA-oPoaBp4": "[Music] hey guys thanks for checking in this is pure pressures solvent let's review episode 1 it should girl Jess and today we're gonna be interviewing Crosby with farmhouse hemp let's take a look at what he brought down on today's episode we'll be reviewing farmhouse hemp's Sullivant 'less hemp CBD rosin infused honey and while that's what we'll be focusing on I also wanted to take just a second to highlight the other really awesome products that he brought down for us to take a look at that we'll also be doing a review on later including their topicals tinctures and pet drops so be sure to check those out this jar contains 500 milligrams of CBD it also has terpenes for the entourage effect as well as trace amounts of other cannabinoids most importantly staying under the 0.3% farm bill regulatory standard for THC this jar testing at 0.0% THC all of those test results as well are available on their website for validation with the batch number that is provided on each one of their products when I opened up the jar initially I got rushed with a smell of rich raw honey and Colorado wild flowers on a warm summer's day today we have Crosby here with farmhouse hemp and we have a lot of products in front of us they're doing a lot of really cool stuff but what I wanted to focus on today is the solvent list hemp honey so let's go ahead and get into it so the first thing I wanted to ask you about is really just you know tell me about the company what's your goal behind making hemp honey you know you were talking a little bit about sustainability earlier let's get into detail on that and then I'd like to know how you make this because it's really cool to see solvent list products out there you really don't see solvent list in consumables topicals anything like that so really cool to have you here for this oh thank you so much for having me absolutely I'd love to talk to you a little bit about farmhouse hemp and how we started the main thing that we saw going on is that we wanted to do everything ourselves and that would mean seed to sale so want it you know with rosin and you know the softness aspect quality in and quality out is so important and we were finding that the market just wasn't providing that quality that we needed to create the saltless product so we started there and we want you know we started with our farm it's sweet Laura farm it's located in LaPorte Colorado it's just north of Fort Collins and this year we actually grew string called the wife okay and it's we grew it all organically just using fish emulsion water and Sun so very natural very easy and the reason we chose rosin and softness extraction for our main method and our only method was the sustainability issue that you brought up and you know when we think about a wellness product as well right pumping you know butane hexane pentane or you know mixtures are the both well they can make a good product and create great yield you know can also have negative effects it conditioner a toil with rosin you know you don't get that you get all the good no parts-per-million either you absolutely worry about any kind of contamination absolutely when you pump all that extraction you're left with a you know material that has gas in it and solvents in it right with rosin you left with a chip yes and what we love about farmhouse is what we do with those chips we actually grind them up and we create compost with them we're actually working to almost create agricultural feed okay i'll feeding it to chickens ducks so we have zero waste and and that's a huge part of farmhouse and you know creating a lesser impact on the environment that's and we found rosin did a fantastic job of that so we don't use chemical solvents gases we stay away from all that and its quality and quality out that's what we love that's so funny that you say that because here at peer pressure quality and quality out is probably one of our top used phrases so it's really cool to hear somebody else use that I mean solvent lists you really have to have quality so to hear you guys using that process it's really cool okay so now let's learn a little bit more about the product itself tell me about it what is it what is what are we looking at what the potency do we have does it have THC in it let us know yeah sure well first I'll start with just the ingredients it's a very simple ingredient list in our farmhouse hemp honey you have raw Colorado wildflower honey awesome right down the road from our farm is where we collect our honey so I'm trying to keep it really local again keeping that sustainability aspect and then what else is in it it's frozen it's a rose and CBD free straight from our farm so what we do is we take that rosin right off the plate we D carve it and you know just hot enough to you know activate the CD but not really boil off any of those turkeys because we find those to be very important and that's a huge reason why we still do rosin is to preserve those turkeys so we take that rosin and we infuse it into our honey we get that honey a little hot but not hot enough where it's killing any of the active bacteria sure or microbials in the honey that is really good for wellness and also that local honey is really good for that seasonal allergy very much so we just put that rosin in after it's d carved okay we infuse it and emulsify it we use an emulsion to really create a homogeneous sure honey that way you know you don't have any hot spots and you touched upon the THC aspect yeah we are a full spectrum product you know using rosin it you get everything you get the fatty acids you get the you know essential oils the vitamins the omega sixes and threes along with that you're going to get trace amounts of THC now that's very trace amount it's below that point three percent THC in fact ours is actually 0.01 - or you know something basically non-existent non-existent but they're just enough to create that entourage effect that a lot of people talk about and with rosin its mother nature right mother nature created this plant and it has all those things put together and mother you know that's the way mother nature intended it so we don't want to manipulate or isolate anything correct so that's why we keep it all together and that's what's in your honey and that's what's really great about us all of this product perfect you get all the goods that's awesome no it's really great that you bring up the entourage effect and how terpenes play into it - that's something that I don't feel a lot of people really know about and I we'll probably end up doing a series on this a little bit down the road but terpenes play a huge part in to the effects that you feel it's not necessarily just a sativa or indica type thing it has to do with the terpenes that are present that play along with the cannabinoids that are present as well so thank you for bringing that up as well it's really cool so really cool all locally sourced here in Denver Colorado Colorado wildflowers it smells amazing it literally smells like Colorado summer like a sweet Colorado summer with a little bit of honey mixed in there it's pretty awesome yeah so my favorite part of the review series we're going to go ahead and get to try this I can't wait to taste this if you guys want to check it out the consistency it's definitely that like sugary just natural honey unadulterated yeah and that really shows you that it's it's raw honey right raw honey crystallizes and you know you know with the corn syrup and all that stuff that won't crystallize but you'll know it's raw and natural when it starts to crystallize like that no that's absolutely beautiful and it does it smells so great the CBD is great for a lot of things tension anxiety relaxation a lot of the major ones for me personally though I find it really beneficial for nerve pain it definitely helps when I've been behind a computer screen all day so let's see what this tastes like it tastes the Wildflower you can and I think that's a lot of the sage and alfalfa that's local in our region so you can get that almost spice in there right now that's a phenomenal yeah and you know it really comes to and that's because I truly believe it's causing the rise in the only it doesn't hide anything you know what you get in is what you get out absolutely so yeah we love it know that tastes phenomenal I did this in a Jasmine green tea so I tried to do something with pretty minimal flavor to it so I could really get the the essence of the honey and it's I'm not disappointed in that one bit my other question for you is I just kind of immediately ran for the for the tea what are your best ways to ingest this what is your suggestion absolutely so we haven't formulated a way that we find is easy for the consumer and that is 20 milligrams per teaspoon okay so and we find that to be a nice starting dose you know for your general wellness sleep headaches minor anxiety okay so starting at 20 milligrams and that's a really easy way to dose most people have a tea spoon in their kitchen so I would clap so grab that tea spoon taking some honey and placing it in your tea my personal favorite is to take it about 45 minutes before bed okay in some tea or in some you know whatever you whatever your warm drink yes absolutely yeah okay yeah and and I really love it that way I first see a really awesome snack of peanut butter with some medicated honey on top of it coming in the near future I think that sounds amazing so the honey is 250 milligrams of CBD 500 500 milligrams of CBD do we have testing on this what are your standards for the consumer do they know that they're getting a clean product let me know about that side of things absolutely Jessica I'm glad you brought that up and something that we take very seriously at farmhouse amp and I think that the consumer should take seriously absolutely is knowing where their CD come comes from how its processed and and at the end what its testing at what's in your product and that is why if you cannot won't open this one because it's got a cap off it but every single one of our products will have a batch number on the bottom okay and that leads to test results directly on our website so you know exactly what's going in your product and you don't just do potency but we do microbe riyals and other testing so that you know that you're also getting a safe product and that it was manufactured in a safe place that's great and that's really important for consumers to educate themselves about absolutely that's something that I think our industry is a little too quiet about testing is really really important so definitely make sure when you're sourcing your CBD products you have somebody that has test results for you if not find a more reliable source that's all I can really say about that all right so the last question that I have for you is when someone purchases this honey or any of your products really that are kind of consumable what effects are they expecting to get what should they prepare for duration that they're waiting for that onset all of those things absolutely so you're gonna get a few different things with our products the honey being that it's going into your mouth and going sublingual there that's gonna have a nice bioavailability it's gonna go a little quicker topicals once you apply them expect a longer time to get through that epidermis it's gonna take a little bit longer so expect to not feel the result right away if he's really and you know what to expect when taking CBD I think you know it's gonna be different for every person so on with anxiety might you know it might take a little bit longer you might have to take it a few times you know maybe taking it just once isn't gonna quite do it getting it into your system and creating a routine I always I think important you know you don't go to the gym and expect results after that one time yeah it's something that you're really going to want to take seriously and put it a part of your routine to really see the result and take it seriously and as far as you know a personal experience I have is I get tension headaches okay and that's where I take a thousand milligrams and you get about 32 milligrams per dropper that is what it comes out to I take one of those under my tongue I leave it there for about 45 seconds to really let it settle in and I feel results within a half-hour I got via the tension release and I and I get some relief and I get some resolves so it just depends on what you're looking for and what you're trying to you know see out of cvd but I definitely suggest you you try and you stick to it and consult your physician I always recommend talking to your doctor and keeping that communication open that's extremely important as well absolutely especially when you have other medications that are in play I know there are some doctors out there that are very willing to kind of take the role and allow both of the medications to work together there's definitely coming from personal experience I moved away from narcotics and him totally cannabinoid based medication but they they're willing to do it but it's definitely a little bit more of a tricky situation because you can't do both at the same time they kind of counteract each other so definitely talking to your physician is a good thing to do awesome thank you so much for stopping by today this is phenomenal I can't wait to share this with our team I'm sure everybody's gonna be super excited about it we're gonna have you come back we want to talk about the dog drops I have a really awesome pet that I'm going to bring in and we'll have those we'll try it

"_okkA_0NP24": "what is that all about good morning good morning welcome to the 7 10 morning show we're back it's thursday good morning nurse colleen good morning happy thursday you look lovely as per usual today tripping thursday tripping thursday all of our same st patty's day stuff is gone saint petty's day but i'm still wearing the green i don't know why i'm feeling my feeling a little green today hope you guys are having a good thursday i know we're having a good thursday did you guys have today do you guys have a good wednesday wednesday um let me se i sent uh carrie the link so she can be our producer again today but i'm not sure if she's received it yet but i'll send you another one you need it got my uh i'm all like messed up over here i don't know what's going on i move this over here now we're on the scene so they're introducing marijuana banking again in the federal government it's going to be really interesting the safe banking act to allow marijuana companies to actually use banks you know the irs has had to build cash rooms just to take tax payments from marijuana banks they have to build separate rooms just to take marijuana company taxes and they don't like doing that marijuana companies don't like having to do that so why are we still doing that i don't know but we're going to talk about that marijuana safe banking act today uh which is back on the floor today in congress on the federal level and then on the state level we've got the uh thc caps there's a couple of amendments that were made in committee to that bill that we're going to talk about one of them extending the time and the amount of marijuana that doctors can prescribe one of them would allow for reciprocity um and another one would get rid of all those stupid thc caps but that's what we're talking about today on the seven set mortar show [Music] yeah that's right it's the 7 10 morning show happy 7 10. and uh we are getting ready to uh allow banking for the uh cannabis industry it's like a bigger deal than most people realize and carry i just sent you another link if that other one expired if you want to get up get up on here so we're uh people don't realize i don't think because it's you know you go to the dispensary you sometimes you can use your card and you see these companies making millions and billions of dollars but not a lot of people realize that banking is a huge issue when it comes to these marijuana companies and the reason is as on the federal level you cannot engage in in banking a company that deals in illegal sales of anything it could be firearms could be anything and here's carrie carrie's with us now um so there's a really really big problem right so two things really affect the cannabis industry one they can't get a bank account right and two they can't write off a whole lot of taxes so their tax bills are really high and they have to pay them in cash right right so that's why even the treasury uh secretary secretary of the treasury has been like we need to do something about this we need them we need them to be able to pay with direct deposit because this is ridiculous right so there what happens is that banks can't touch uh some like a marijuana company because it's a federally illegal substance and if they do they can lose their federal deposit insurance which is which basically ensures that if the bank gets robbed or something happens that they don't owe everybody all the money that they put right that fdic insurance is federally backed insurance um same as the doctors with the dea license it's a federal license right i don't have a federal license as a nurse you don't have a federal license only a state a state license right right so the so the banks are not allowed to um touch these companies so that's why you see if you've ever seen like a check from one of these companies or anything or if you have a scene i've had to send them any money it gets deposited into usually a um a state state bank or a state credit union right those are who have come out to try and do this there was a bank that was called first green bank that came out in florida that was banking marijuana companies and they quickly put the kibosh on that and stopped banking marijuana companies very interesting so it's a risk that the banks take independently but what the safe banking act would do is protect them right so um it was filed again today right it was refiled it was filed by democrat from colorado and a bipartisan group of co-sponsors have reintroduced it and the measure cleared the house last time but it died in the senate under republican control and now that the senate is not under republican control they think that it's actually going to get through the senate um the safe banking act would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working in the industry forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets for crime and creates complications for financial regulators so the other side of it is you know opening up uh investing you know to where companies that have you know large amounts of money that want to invest in cannabis companies but can't because of this uh illegal status yeah that's a that's another big what are you what are you rolling up there um this is some ground from cure leaf some ground flour and i added some um crumble in there oh jesus my back is killing me i see froggy said she had a rough night last night i've been having some rough nights too see you seem to sleep a little bit better i did sleep a little better last night before i was just tossing and turning all night long so last night was not as bad but i my butt is sore again i get this knot like deep in my butt and i think it presses right on the sciatic nerve or something on the a nerve right it's like a radiating pain not fun doesn't sound like it no so i have a heating pad under my butt today nice of course she looks wonderful chuck why didn't you not look wonderful thank you chuck um miss you guys so this bill the the safe banking act was actually supposed to be part of this coronavirus bill that it just passed that that biden just signed it was supposed to be part of that but they took it out you know why because it shouldn't [ __ ] be in there in the first place and that's what and that's one of the reasons why democrats hardly ever get anything done is because they try and stick everything into everything and things that are unrelated and it gets shot down because like oh this is going to pass let me add something to it let me add something to it it's going to pass and what happens it doesn't it [ __ ] doesn't uh so it's leading the donna ground oh it's the cultivar of the day that's funny it's good for uh women's month yeah there you go um so uh what was i just saying i forgot oh democrats throw everything in the bill yeah so this was par supposed to be part of this coronavirus bill but it's not part of the coronavirus bill shouldn't have been part of the coronavirus bill um but sometimes when you know i think it's like politics like playing the game after you've been in it for so long this is how things are done you tack things on to other bills it's the only way things get done i don't think that that's necessarily the way to move forward um i think you know with the transparency that we have now that may be an old way of thinking um politically but with the transparency and the internet and the mass communications that we have now i think that these individual topics are going to get the attention so people are going to dissect these bills and be like hey look this and this and this and this and then everybody's going to know about it whereas before it could just like slide in at the 11th hour yeah right oh wow good morning everybody bro you're a much worse position than i am we all need to rest today i don't know is it like um bad weather out there today or something what happened is there like a heavy weather system over us today oh look it's jody james she's joining us she's in our waiting room how exciting we're almost at the where we're going to bring her in to talk about um what's going on today they're they're actually they had it was yesterday but they actually have um they're in committee uh for hb 1455 and they've introduced a few amendments maybe jody can talk about that and talk about what's going on up in tallahassee pretty exciting storming the panhandle it's a revolution what happened chuck says storming the panhandle it's a revolution guys it is it's big storms okay all right so um i guess let's why don't we bring jody in we're not actually doing a really long show today because i have an appointment uh early on so we're gonna bring jody and jody is with florida can she's been running florida can for ever and one of the many reasons many many reasons why we have one of the one of the few people that has made an enormous difference in getting marijuana legislation passed here in florida and continues to fight up in tallahassee so we're going to bring in jody now if your headphones work if you need him good morning hey good morning morning all right we can hear you that's great well how exciting and in just a minute you're going to see josephine crail from mmj knowledge and we might get eric stevens to pop in from florida for care because as you mentioned today's a big day in the panhandle it sure is what's going what's going on up there with this with these thc caps that they might as well just jump right into it i think people will kind of want to hear it um straight from people who are up there and um and in touch with it day to day so what's going on with it today caps caps caps they're wanting to cap thc they want to cap the amount of cannabis i can have every 35 days and they want a cap free enterprise and so um a group of us have gotten together florida cannabis action network took some time last night to do a zoom meeting with some of the patients that are going to be speaking today it's going to be awesome if anybody's watching we're really really well prepared florida for care is bridging the gap with the doctors and making sure that the medical professionals are being heard from so we're we expect that the bill will pass but um we fight the good fight and at the end of the day we really don't expect this bill to be signed by the governor but the reason it won't be signed by the governor is because people like you and the people who are following you are engaged right the thing that we've been stressing the most i think it's in the background maybe i think it might be me oh me well it could be us too let me let me mute us i think we're better now um turned up too high so it gives me a little bit of an echo well you're in a studio where we're actually in the war room josephine is joining us i'm gonna switch our layout a little bit so we can see more you guys there you go yeah that's right we get to see your whole face he's always hiding off the screen hi josephine how are you how are you great great do you want to uh introduce yourself to everyone sure um i'm josephine canela crail i'm a licensed clinical social worker i've been licensed in florida for over 30 years background is as a substance abuse therapist and then i transitioned over to hospice medical social work so i've been working uh with chronically critically and terminally ill patients for a very long time connected with jody up at the capitol uh through my husband actually he met jody first he was he kind of got me started on this cannabis advocacy journey connected with florida cannabis action network in 2013 and i guess this is the rest of the story all of these years later i'm back in tallahassee every year talking to our makers and trying to move forward with sensible cannabis policy reform what do you think what's your impression now as opposed to years past is the climate up there in pelham is it any different is there any yeah there's a mutiny afloat so um you know every year with term limits so um all of the house of representatives is elected every two years and they can only serve four two-year terms in any chamber or eight years in either chamber right so every two years thirty percent are entirely new those new folks that come in every year they don't believe like the old guard did they have heard from people who are listening to us right now about how wonderful this medicine is they have visited one of the states where 93 million americans are living under a legal cannabis scheme and it's working so they're not as bought and paid for by the partnership for a drug free america as their predecessors were so there's hope that's great and hope is really important because um you know some of the things that we hear coming out can can be kind of you know it could be devastating when you hear representative roach paint a picture of doctors who are out to get rich and patients who are drug seekers chasing a legal high um as if you know people haven't already been getting high for thousands of years that we would need to pretend we want a medical program to get high is is just you know ludicrous so so glimmers of hope is definitely what we turn to and what we hold on to otherwise i just don't believe we'd be able to come back year after year it's is there a way to kind of put people in front of them that um have a little bit more credibility to them that could that could talk about some more of the science and the statistics around the opiate addiction and you know where medical marijuana is and how those opiate opiate addiction rates are affected by that and it seems like they respond to to um statistics and things like that when um other people present them but i don't see a lot of you know people presenting the you know the things that we talk about every day for instance uh well this is a particularly unique year because of coven shut down we're having a hard time even getting on to the office um some of the lobbyists up here like wow we didn't realize how much of our job was you know in the back room and i'm like i guess that was the good thing about never being invited to the back room nothing changed for us so you know we still know how to agitate and aggravate and uh i was listening to the a t protest i have some suggestions born of many many years of experience and you guys were talking about campaign finance report see i do pay attention in case you wondered um have you started looking at their political action committees that's a that's that's a rabbit hole oh you know it um only the geekiest among us um luckily for florida cannabis action network we have a couple of those and they do a great job but you know you learn a lot about what's going on and you know florida cannot forget that we are actually the home of drug free america uh in the 90s they had an office in st petersburg with a locked door when i first opened my office in my home i kept my front door standing open because drug-free america was behind a locked door and god said do what you do in the light of day so um we can't forget that they're definitely controlling the narrative um probably about a month ago now uh phd thank you and that she works with patients and really she doesn't um you know she was invited in to give basically an overview of marijuana um and the thing that frustrates me the most is we're still having conversations about marijuana as a harmful substance and what we really need to be talking about is clinical cannabis therapeutics but we're talk because we're talking about medicine and we we tried to get the other side of the story invited into committee and the leadership was simply not open to it so they got a very one-sided view which to answer your question pete how do we get our experts in will we change the leadership one election at a time and we're doing that um it's not 1936 this is the the death throw and and always remember if we're only allowed to have 10 thc then everything over 10 is a crime that we need to be put private prison for or treated in a mandatory treaty and as long as they um powers that be are invested in private prisons and coercive treatment we're going to continue to have to criminalize some sort of behavior because that's how their business models work yeah yeah so the other thing that we do and we've been coordinating i think i heard jody say we had a strategizing meeting last night as far as how did we get the message in there quite honestly we do it 30 seconds at a time and so that's why we strategized with what is it that we're gonna say because um in the last committee they literally gave us 30 seconds we had physicians that um florida care eric his team helped coordinate to bring from around the state we had patients that florida can coordinated and we were given 30 seconds so if you have a strategy and for this 30 seconds we kind of paint the story not through one presenter but through all of us giving the story 30 seconds at a time the human entourage effect the human entourage effect because you know like the cannabis plant when we come together we can be so much more effective than any of us could be on our own so i like to call it the human entourage effect advocating for the entourage effect of our plant for sure yeah hey what's going on guys how are you doing eric how are you you're supposed to have a shot i just have a mouthful thank you but uh yeah no these legislators are you know they made it really difficult uh i'm sure you saw the hearing last time but you know these dogs are expecting to get two or three minutes each you know they barely got 30 seconds broken up and so you know thankfully we were all able to you know talk you know we all have kind of understood where their talking points are going and you know everybody as best they could kind of spoke from their voice and kind of gave their you know different tidbit it would have been nice for them to have you know strung that together a little bit more but i you know it was so effective the media picked up on it we had a bunch of reporters that were talking it was too easy to get sound bites later because we were only speaking 30 seconds at a time yeah it was probably great if you haven't seen our roach clips um florida cannabis action network is encouraging people to pass around some roach clips these days you gotta hear this guy in his own words it's 1936 all over again this is reefer madness i mean it's just it's roach crunch so today we're in health care appropriations we're supposed to be talking about financial impacts um we are going to shift the narrative a little bit when you you go into committee that's why it's really important to understand the process specific committees are intended to deal with specific issues so if you go into healthcare appropriations and you're just talking about how great cannabis is they will shut you down quite honestly before your 30 seconds or even up because they'll say speak to the bill so that's another advantage of partnering you know or reaching out to the folks who have been doing this for more than a minute or two because today in healthcare appropriations we're shifting the narrative a little bit and we're going to talk about cost yes but we're going to talk about the human cost you know so that we can relate it to the topic and get our messaging across but not necessarily in dollars and cents because there's a lot more at stake cost wise and my message is going to be if we place these caps that means weaker medicine weaker medicine is less effective and the unintended consequence is going to be pushing people not only to the illicit market but quite honestly back to opioids that they have been able to successfully come off of and what is the human cost it's going to cost lives so we we as an industry as a people as a culture as a movement are going to likely have to accept some caps on some products i don't know if you uh frequent starbucks but you can only get so many shots of espresso in your drink right there is a limit so good morning crystal you wanna come say hi oh look at her in the beautiful cannabis dress oh my god we're on the we're on the 710 morning show with colleen nurse colleen and peter oh thank you very much for allowing us to have to be here with you this morning it's probably going to get loud here we have folks coming in as the gang is getting ready before you guys did want to answer ask about the uh poll the florida for capital that was just uh released i thought that that was really great i thought it got a lot of great media pickup um have you has anybody been responsive to it up there have you have you seen any kind of response to it i mean i've been hearing that you know a lot of people's side they were you know surprised to see the numbers where they were um and you know i think it just continues to reinforce what we have been saying and that people continue to want this and trust their doctors uh you know and i think that was the most frustrating thing for me last week was you know representative roche talking negatively about all these doctors that were there and equating them to oh yeah and you know he got asked about overdose deaths or fatal overdoses and you're trying to say no one could overdose because there's no dosage limit and you know it's just circular arguments yes the doctors is absolutely ridiculous so it was like especially when the pharmaceutical companies which are on that list of his donors campaign donors are the ones that come into the doctor's offices giving them the products to try and promote it's like his argument doesn't even it comes right back around to him so you know i think you just need someone to make those arguments what do you recommend we do other than calling our representatives well before we move on um florida can uh has some partners that also ran a poll and i would love if jody can speak for uh too for a moment to the poll that um the numbers that we were looking at great minds think alike it was the week for polls um we actually were pulling north florida because i'm most interested in what our conservative friends in the panhandle think about this and we only ask two questions because we're not rich like floor picture he laughs because the three of us are sharing in an inexpensive house we rented but um so the first question that we asked it was did the respondent think that marijuana recreational marijuana should be legalized this legislative session and would you believe 51 percent of republican likely voters that means they voted in the last eight elections that means they show up every time the polls are open 749 people over 340 of them were over the age of 65 years old and 51 of republicans are saying yes these are primary voters and that's what's going to change um what can you do get to know somebody who is running for office or is in office because you do stuff for your friends why are we on the 710 show this morning because you like somebody who likes us and we do something for our friends why do we have the limited medical marijuana program that we have in this state because first and foremost don gates and matt gates were neighbors of the moseleys and florida cannabis action network had been agitating and agitating and agitating but the mosleys were their friends they weren't doing anything for us but they would do something for someone they knew and someone they liked and someone they cared about i was told the other day that sometimes a group will hire a lobbyist to reach one specific member so if i want to do something i might hand some do 10 grand to get one vote the way we get one vote is they love us and each of us can find one of these 160 people and make sure they love us and then they will do what we need them to do and and the thing that i like to remind people is that this is really a long game and it's a game it's a game that we're playing and it's a long game so get your medicine where you can and be safe it's a strategy you know we see a frenzy during legislative session where people are oh boy now we have to pay attention to this issue if you want to do the real work go and speak to your legislator your senator your representative while they're in the district and they're not distracted with hundreds of other bills and and get to know them this is me this is my story this is my mom this is my kid this is why it's important and this is why we need you i write 25 checks i am not a rich woman my husband puts the bill for me to be in a place like this and we write 25 checks but i know a bundle of people and i get phone calls returned because i deliver 10 20 checks it's not a lot but it's 10 more names on that and they'll call me back and it's consistent and it's you know these guys are in office for several years decades so you know you write a 50 check this quarter and then maybe next quarter you can only afford 20 dollars and you know people get frustrated and i understand you know it's like well i don't wanna buy whatever you have to understand how the process works you have to understand how the system works and if you want to be effective you have to step into that system and you have to operate within the rules of engagement because if you do that then you're welcomed in if we go in there and we just blast away right which can be fun it's fun and there's a place for that and it feels good momentarily because i know i've done it before too demonstrate agitate because we need people doing it at all levels and quite honestly sometimes um in the past when we've had people come in and um i've taken a constituent to meet with their lawmaker and i'm probably not supposed to say this and that person got a little aggravated and perhaps said something to the lawmaker like you know you're clueless you're out of step with reality or something like that i do like jody does i like find my face but at the same time i'm like yeah yeah because they gotta hear this right right and you can get away with it you know so it's it's walking that fine line of pomp and circumstance and yes sir and yes chairman yes thank you um and kind of being a little agitated because i've gotten to the point where i've been sitting in committee and i'm like there is nothing that they're going to hear that i say that's going to sway them so i'm going for 30 seconds of political theater because i'm going to have it on tape on the florida channel in front of um a podium and i'm gonna you know push the limit a little and i'm gonna agitate today and you know quite frankly when we weren't getting any attention back in the day our immediate past president would wear this school marm outfit with this boost pa she would and i mean people would look because it's theater man so again thank you guys for your time you're doing a fabulous job thank you guys for joining us and um i imagine that after today's session we'll have a whole new series of roach clips which are our video clips because we figure the best way to help the public understand what's going on behind these closed doors is to have you guys hear it in their own words i don't want to have to explain what representative roach said he does a much better job oh sorry my talent is about to stab her in the eye no i was just not going to be associated with him you know hearing it in their own words has just so much more of an impact yeah yeah i think we go to watch for today and i'll try to find the polls that you spoke about do we have anything else i think we probably have to start wrapping up and getting ready to head out yeah we're leaving out at 8 15. yeah there's a couple amendments we gotta read up a little bit more on those oh you had asked about the amendments carlos smith has two amendments he has two amendments one of them is on reciprocity one of them would increase the um daily dose limit uh and basically just kind of eliminate some of the worse that's in roach's build both of those amendments will be heard and defeated neither one of them will be considered friendly representative driscoll who is an amazingly powerful woman uh in the democratic party right now has added one that would make the card for six years you're about to get into them as well super all right 4 000 milligrams i think every uh that's that was in carlos's bill every 35 days and i think that's more consistent with what the department of health the job of creating a dose limit was tasks the department of health the department of health has done that job however the rule has never been finalized so the daily dose limits are out there representative roach continued to talk about how you could get an exemption for it that there was a simple form 14 days the form has never been finalized because the dose limit has never been finalized and of course anybody who's used cannabis knows that you can while you cannot die from an overdose of cannabis taking too much cannabis can certainly make you feel uncomfortable um and thank uh thank the plant that there's a remedy for that right showers and pepper i'm gonna go change my clothes thank you so much yes thank you have a great morning and we'll uh we'll circle back around so excellent thank you very much all right that was fun that was great yeah it really was wow i don't know what you were doing but you were hitting the right button oh yeah yeah yeah i realized that yeah i was like oh no something could happen it's like don't go back it's so weird wearing the earphones um right isn't it interesting with the earphones [Laughter] that was great wow so where can we go to watch it today do you know to watch what can we watch the committee today um yes it's on the florida journey the floridachannel.org or dot com whatever you just google the florida channel and uh that'll come up it's uh it's uh what do you call it um like government channel but you know what that's the channel i was saying has gotten way better yeah like now it looks like it was produced by um i don't know they got better technology because it used to be really bad now it's like they got different shots and stuff the audio was good yeah it's nice yeah oh cool so yeah i mean i saw clips from it from last time but i didn't actually watch it but i would like to watch it today yeah you can watch on the floridachannel.org or just google the florida channel and they have like a whole schedule on there and stuff and you can watch it there and then i don't know about the clips the roach clips that's hilarious i don't know where you can get those just yet that's so cute did you guys get that so they said roach clips but it's not like an actual roach clip it's just little clips up there it's got the double meaning you know they're uh of their uh i guess the time in the committee right yeah so um tv clips little video clips and the polls are available the florida faker poll got picked up everywhere so if you just google florida poll they'll it'll pop up marijuana is it floridacan.org or what's their website theirs is fl can.org i know maria was in there yeah i saw maria say maria posted it i don't know if uh i can get that far back where's maria it might have been a while ago i think it was flcan.org yeah i think that was it you know what i can do is i can just try and go there oh it's still on here oh that's not it or i could just google florida i think it's just ca no yeah there it is nope there it is yeah you're right yeah flcan.org go there well let me go there florida can manufacturing there you go i'm going to post it in the comments so everybody gets it and they can just click on it that's where you can go are they still back in the back room back there they are still like in the back room i don't know if they realize that but uh we just took them out of the of the live another thing she's like how do i get out how do i shut this off can you do those little thing three things and i don't know a kick from studio there she goes kick guest there you go [Music] that's funny that was like with my attorney when we had um the court um we had a break and he was on the phone and he didn't realize that he still had his audio it could be a little dangerous it could be oh so uh the bills that we were talking about yeah i was looking at those and yeah the they do not they just to be fair these these are not considered like they're probably not going to pass right right right but these are amendments to well it's meant to push back you know and to make these arguments you know because if they're pulling the pendulum one way then we've gotta you know pull it back the other way and uh one of them that carlos guillermo smith has introduced is for reciprocity so that um people with medical cards from other states could use them in florida so smart which uh so that's that's one of the bills that he's introduced the other one um extends the amount of time um that you um actually it increases the amount of cannabis that you can get over your 35 day recommendation so it doesn't put um so instead of putting a cap on how much smokable you can get it basically puts a really high cap on how much thc you can get overall right so you can get it looks like it says 54 000 milligrams every 35 days which is kind of a lot mm-hmm i think we get like 30 right we never even go nearer yeah um but why but it doesn't separate smoking in anything so it's you can get oh it'll be smoking too so it's all together oh interesting so you can get all flour if you want right huh that'd be great yeah right so that's that's smart um right so it gets rid of that smoking cap which i like i heard that i thought one um decreased the amount of visits required to the doctor yes that's the other one by um let me see i'm going to get his name right over here driscoll and this one does every six years you have to renew your card what every six years wow so you wouldn't have to do it every year that seems a little cool right i mean that's really interesting yeah right why six years ago um why six years that's a good question i don't know i don't know where they the rationale behind six years but that would increase that and then i believe also in carlos's other bill it also see here's this 54 thousand milligrams every 35 days every 35 days right he gets rid of this two and a half ounces bs over here i'm like why is it 35 days 35 seven like i don't get that because it's like half of seventy and seven why seventy thousand i don't know why not sixty and thirty i guess i don't because you know it's gotta be a reason right it's government they do it's what they do so um yeah we would we would be able to get rid of those limits i think that would be that would be really good yes but these these don't really have an opportunity of passing right um because they don't want to hear it too extreme they are oh there's the roach clips oh they're so cute there's the roach clips i don't know how to can i get to that wait no we can't i don't want to delete it i just want to click on it i can't click on the comment everybody else can oh you can't go there no i can't actually click on it uh i don't know how i would do that can you search for florida can on youtube um that's a good idea let's see i can absolutely do that let's [Music] [Laughter] are see going to uh keep everyone entertained while you do that or like the ketchup there we are it's funny when youtube comes up and it's us this is not going to work florida a little sleepy this morning from taking rso um i don't want to see the yeah it's going to work no no but maybe they haven't been on there to their channel no i don't see it um yeah you all need a link to your youtube channel well there's not no i don't see your work see maria what are those little lines right there these little lines yeah join today what about happenings emphasize insights no blog happenings let's check out happenings no calendar of events no no ma'am it's a shorter day today yeah it's longer than others you're right some end at 7 45. uh yes some end at 7 45 but uh it's shorter than actually it doesn't have to be that short i think i got confused i think i felt like i thought my appointment was at eight o'clock it was at eight but it's nine right it's nine yeah yeah i thought i was equating it with having the to leave early you know but i guess i don't have that much we don't have to leave that much earlier but it can't be a two-hour show this uh that's what i meant to do this one here oh there's josephine you guys can click on that though yeah you guys click on it and check it out but we can check them out later because i want to see them and that's so cute and creative it is roach clips yeah i don't know well he kind of gives it to you it's kind of a gift this guy with his roach clips um uh so what else is going on we talk about banking we talk about all that good stuff uh what do we smoke today we had some uh cure leaf uh the ground lady madonna lady madonna and then i have some rso2 that i've been taking and yeah how how's that you've been a big fan of the flavor of that rs oh yes yeah this is one of the better ones because you had some other one that you would not had one that i did not like at all made you make a really funny face i'm not going to say who it was actually tasted a lot like the ones that we made was that cool it had like a leftover it wasn't this one this one's still i think your words to me was this is awful try this carrie that was me i'm like it's like there's no reason to be negative right i was waiting for somebody to do it and i wasn't paying too much attention that was the whole point that depends on then he was he's yeah the whole point was not to pay attention like carry out use the axe [Music] so this saturday we will be in miami there's some people that live down there it's near the uh that gun place that we posted the picture of it's near the gun place so if you have a store if you happen to need some firearms as a as well you cannot there was a diner right there um there was diner didn't didn't we do we didn't we ate there oh yeah we should definitely eat there again yeah was it good uh yeah okay then we should eat there again yeah i'm pretty sure we liked it i don't remember what we ate but i'm pretty sure we liked it uh yeah i i think you liked it at it uh josephine the human entourage dr block mentioned to us entourage yeah you want to explain it it was an ensemble instead of an entourage yes and i like that a lot it's announced because an entourage needs a leader right right like the kid from from from queens right he was like right so i mean like thc would be the leader so the guy with the hair he was the leader and then turtle was like part of his entourage right so it's an ensemble because they work together right instead of one leading because again the government has that screwed up too it's not just about the delta nine oh yes but they think it is but where we are you know what we are mad scientists right if you make one molecule illegal we'll figure out a way around that [ __ ] yeah so we got delta eight delta ten we got these oh we got two deltas and then when we put them together in our body yeah then it creates something even more potent this is the kind of thing you get when you regulate like that when you try and tell people what they can and can't do people like wait but i really want to do that you're not going to stop them they're going to figure it out yeah they're going to figure it out how are you going to regulate that out of people it's ridiculous it's ridiculous yes i agree and just like uh they were saying like josephine was saying and and jordy were saying like people have been getting high for centuries are you gonna stop them from doing that well why is alcohol okay like that's what that's the whole thing okay you tried to stop them and it didn't work it was it was awful but like what are the benefits i can understand alcohol right because we've had this discussion before where i didn't think there was any medical benefits alcohol and you proved me wrong and prove you wrong i just opened my mind to other well there are yeah there's definitely medicinal benefits to alcohol uh but what about tobacco what are the benefits of tobacco why is that still legal um you know i don't know but at the same time why is it shouldn't be illegal it just shouldn't be like promoted as something that's safe i don't i think you should be able to do whatever the hell you want you know i don't think you should be able you should tell people well you can't do that and you can't do that because when you tell i think when you tell people that they can't do something they instinctually want to do it don't you right you know right i think so especially like kids kids definitely what am i doing here it's this one no this one what are you gonna do you give you're you're doing the opposite of what we're trying to put them on the screen oh is that what i did oh what am i doing get on top of that you cannot let colleen touch the touch the mouse that's the that's the job it's the same person keeps coming back with like this the names are so similar they're like all caps and they're like oh and they put like one little little like letter or word and they're getting you every time every time they're getting you they're distracting you every single time my nose is running i think i have allergies i got some hair on me over here i'm really distracted today um but why should why should we we tell people that they can't uh they can't use cannabis so they can't do stuff i mean if i know that people are are paying a lot of taxes right there's like taxis and people are doing their taxes and realizing how much your money goes to the government and then you're also watching the news and watching the government spend your money like crazy right and you're just like holy [ __ ] what's going on here you know what you have to thank for paying taxes federal income taxes on just the money that you earn just i make money that's my crime that i have right right it's because of prohibition of alcohol it's because they decided to say you know we want to take this away from everyone everybody's drinking too much we're going to take this away and when they did that they ran out of money because 90 of the the um funds for the government were from taxes on alcohol right because taxes were so high on alcohol because it was like you know it was a vice tax or something to that effect and they eliminated all of that income so i don't even think it was a bad problem i think they wanted to do that just to get on the income tax system to kind of usher it in but um you know you have that to thank like if you if you don't like paying income tax it's because they made alcohol illegal and then they had to make it legal like you know you've seen the untouchables even [ __ ] the untouchables were drinking right what about the benefits right right the benefits when we make this recreationally legal like amazing the benefits of the tax benefits oh the tax benefits i thought you meant like you could smoke while water skiing and stuff why do i always think of water skiing when i think of recreation i don't know but why it's weird why would you smoke while you're water skiing and like because that's what i think it's so weird that's what i think of recreation it's so weird that you put smoking and water skiing together like no i'm not saying that it's weird how do you even light it while you're water skating i don't even water ski i don't even like water skiing it's not fun it's so weird but like when i think of like a sign that says recreation i picture like somebody on like a water ski right like we're recreating yeah yeah yeah maybe not i don't know that's not everybody no no i would not put those two things together i think it would be quite impossible to light a joint while you're water skiing because of the wind and also the water and you got to hold on while you're doing it so how would you manage that it takes a lot of upper body strength i know that a lot but you need but you have to be able to do it with one hand you got to hold on with your mouth yes you along with your mouth just keep the joint in your mouth right no no no you have to hold on to the um the rope with your mouth oh with your oh okay because right because you got to hold on to the rope with the boat with your mouth while you light the joint oh i see because how are you going to light it and roll outside all right but yeah this is one of the better um rso's cure leaf and the process in which it's made it it has a green tint to it you can see especially the tip you can see at the end there i'm just i'm all gone it's all it's all gone but yeah when you open the tip you can see there's still like it's green a green tint to it is the chlorophyll chlorophyll yeah what is chlorophyll chlorophyll is that why the grass is green yeah it's very medicinal for you but it's i'm team what what need to get more today yeah so definitely gonna need some more yeah so i wonder what the whole uh interview sounded like on instagram when you couldn't see everybody but you could still hear them the microphones go in there yeah yeah you can still hear them i'll see so um margie jones the thc cap you guys go back to the beginning or like what was it like 7 30 maybe around that time yeah you can yeah i mean you can go in like around 10 minutes in we started talking about the cap and then uh florida can came on florida can came on and uh that was fun we got a bunch of people in that josephine and then jody and eric stevens um there's a bunch of people going up there today i know jamie's going up there andrea's involved she offered up some space if anyone needs somewhere to stay yeah these are the people that are up in tallahassee fighting for you um get taken taking the uh the the stage for 30 30 seconds at a time right right right i really like that food we made yesterday was so good we made corned beef and then i did like some different like twists on the um cabbage yeah that was delicious it was really good i had a nutmeg bacon and the red wine vinegar it's really good yeah we added how much bacon it was like add two strips of bacon how many should we have thick bacon we added the whole container like a pound that's better improved this recipe for sure and then we're like well a couple more well i might as well just do all of them and even the potatoes they were like crispy and then with like parsley and rosemary and thyme um lisa you're having some nerve compression pain i am too right now my butt oh no yes there's colleen is sitting huge not my butt what are you sitting on i'm sitting on a heating pad oh you guys see there's a heating pad right here i thought it was oh look i forgot about this i thought that was a tough-it i ordered the fabric for the rv which i do not like this color at all it's like p it was supposed to be it said kiwi and it was supposed to be more like that 710 morning show color there wow look at that good juxtaposition there only one of those is digital i like it technically they're both digital but this is for the seats i like that it looks pretty cool yeah i like the black so we got the seats got to put it with that there's the table [Music] yeah we got to put it with the table it does have some of the green on the table in there so yeah so i was looking more for like a kelly green for this this is supposed to be the curtains but that's not not right i'll pick that up i need to go back it's my hip and my back and my knee my hip and my knee are hurting me but my hip is like off off place i need to have got to go the chiropractor interesting interesting then we got to get some this does not work i don't like that there you go that's how it'll look with the seats they're gonna look pretty cool i think so too that's going to be fun so martha's excited for may wonder what my martha's excited for may what's going on in may may may is my son's birthday yeah that's a lot of birthdays in may actually right around i think a couple are may 22nd the same day i'm getting excited for may the 4th oh no battery yeah low battery up on instagram low battery low battery oh um some exciting news um the artist who painted this picture will be working on some more work for the can of field day soleil so we all can look forward to that and my daughter might do some stuff too i'm trying to convince her to do some artwork chris says if we put all of our bodies together maybe we might have one functioning body paint one pain-free body out of all of us where do you see the uh lisa's moving near uh carrie that's cute the uh thing the thumbnail thing yeah what do you say it's pretty funny ah oh yeah that god is the goddess picnic there's a goddess picnic it's this sunday with um cannibalist joe and uh chef mary and i think it's in central florida but it says central two tickets left only two yeah um oh let's let's get him and then nobody else can come so did you notice what uh what jody was talking about with oh there we are did you see it started that's hilarious you guys gotta look on instagram today the thumbnail is pretty funny so um did you notice what jody was saying about matt gates so matt gates is uh he was in the state um legislature but now he's in the um he's one of our senators from florida matt gates he's a very staunch republican you would not you probably would not get along with him at all there's a certain type of type of he does i in my person i don't i don't appreciate there's something that may offset it is that he does have heidi he does have a mate he has amazing hair so that might offset it heidi's over in puerto rico all right i love heidi and memory i think i got that right amazing hair he has yes he does matt gates you said yes so that may influence your opinion of him [Music] you spoke about the banking a little while back right in the show yeah so if you scroll back you could see where pete talks about the banking maybe like 10 minutes in or so [Laughter] so where is he in florida do you know i don't i don't remember exactly what what area he's at but i think it's up near um jacksonville or orlando-ish area like around there because what jody was saying was that he was neighbors with the mosleys do you know who the mosleys are that would be peyton mosley right right so is the president ceo of vitacan vitacon right and they're the only florida based company but that what what they're saying is that so peyton's daughter has a cannabis story so you would call him a canada dad or whatever so that's what influenced matt gates right to fight for this and he brought along a lot of other people that you wouldn't normally get along with right but don't have as amazing they wouldn't they don't have as amazing hair as matt gates though so you would definitely not get along with him but he did he is one of the reasons that we have this here he's the guy that went in front of the legislature with all the [ __ ] from the like the nutrition stores that had hemp in it like hemp seed stuff i love you okay i love you too what's happening no i just love how you're like you wouldn't get along with him he's that closed-minded every conservative republican i didn't say that i just said he wouldn't get along with him right that's great because i don't think that you would agree on on a few things um but he is the reason that you know a big reason that why we have while this was able to not only pass um he was the reason that they passed sb 1030 right because he went in front of the legislature with all the hemp seed oil stuff from all the health food stores right and he went in front of everybody and was like look this stuff half of the stuff tested for too much um thc already on right shelves yeah you know yeah so um it's interesting how that uh how about how the politics work yeah and it was interesting point that you made i thought yeah you know about being friends with them yeah yeah rights rights yeah but we were like we had spoke with um orleans or normal at the meeting that this uh can of field day the money that we raise from donations we're going to be able to do more for our movement going up with trips to tallahassee we can go up there with florican [Music] yes and we can do things we can do more things you also um maybe can uh donate to some [Music] politicians don't know if i agree with them i don't know i don't know what we're able to do with it but i don't know if i agree with some of that stuff but um i do think that you know she also mentions how their poll only had you know two questions and eric's poll had like a bunch of questions because they don't have as much money as florida florida for care so there is you know there's money out there it's just ways to kind of strategically use it to convince them you know what i mean maybe maybe we should use it to buy a house next to one of them yeah right right right so we can live there and yeah yeah yeah that seemed like the advice the advice seemed to be go move next to some of the members of congress and become their friends they're friends right right so so let's let's pull together and raise enough money to become their neighbor i think we should probably whoever the our palm beach representative we should probably move next door to that our palm beach rep is was hanging with the um mike greco the other day yes he's a democrat um what's his name like oh then he probably doesn't live in a good way not something but he's probably he's i'm probably on board with everything uh mike greco is the one who introduced the psilocybin bill but does he live on the intercoastal is the question probably because that's where we want to move right yes yes yes right it has to be a desirable area right that's what i'm thinking is he maybe lives next to stallone right oh my gosh so he's like i don't know if you guys saw where we like ride the bikes on the on palm beach island yeah we live like 10 miles from trump's house we live west but palm beach island where trump lives it's 10 miles east of us um and you can go out there and we ride the bikes on the intercoastal and that's where uh stallone um he just posted a video like in the same exercises and that same thing like like doing like a selfie video i was like holy [ __ ] i was just over there that place looks familiar i could run into [ __ ] stallone like riding the bike over there who's that other guy um we're definitely like going down there who's the guy goodfellas which one the main guy really ada i saw him when i heard he was homeless when i worked at palm beach gardens medical center i saw him because where the med surg unit is medical surgical unit uh hospice is right next to it right and he was in there i guess visiting his mom so i saw him leaving one day ah but he looked not so great he looks much better now in the commercials i think he like quit smoking and the commercial just looks good but really it's hysterical there's a lot of people around here though oh yeah a lot yeah um i i used to see a lot of people in manhattan like all the time yeah yeah and i think they all live there because nobody gives a [ __ ] it's just like i'm i don't care oh yeah it's like that guy right right he was like yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember one time i was walking out of my building and i walked past isaac hayes isaac hayes is a as a case isaac is a singer you probably would recognize him um isaac hayes did the um voice of chef on south park oh okay okay so he was coming out of like i guess being on stern or something and he was like walking out and i was like i like looked at him i was like i know that guy from somewhere because he's got like big glasses yeah like you've seen him before and i'm like what the [ __ ] do i know that guy and i'm literally like maybe 10 steps away and i'm like isaac hayes that's what i said it's so loud that he heard me and he was like hey and i was like that was hilarious because it's just like you walk by people you're like who that is salty balls [Music] um armani uh michael kreco is the one who introduced a psilocybin bill yes i'm super excited about that did you see i sent you oh well you probably didn't but i sent you a video it was either on facebook or instagram but you asked about where the law what about the psychedelic where we are are we with psychedelics in florida and this is basically that it was dustin talking about um what the bill does you know and it's pretty cool it's like a little video so um awesome i sent it to you that's mr cannabis law and mr psychedelic yes yes anybody and he talks about it really good i like it and it's a white background so i like white backgrounds awesome so um armani if you go back to about 10 minutes 10 15 minutes into the show we had the people on from florida canada talking about the thc cap they're going in today to committee again yes so you can hear that it's in its second committee and there's amendments to the bill in the committee that they don't believe that are going to go through that would you know change it for the better um but you know there's going to be some people heard again today but it is expected this the thc caps are expected to pass the house but they're not expected to pass the senate so um don't be too discouraged if it does pass the house a lot of people expect that it will but there are good arguments being made so if they're pulling the pendulum in one direction we're pulling the pendulum back and opening the discussion to removing any kind of caps on smokeable even you know and allowing for reciprocity and allowing for cards to be renewed every six years as opposed to every year so there's a lot of um a lot of you know good things that are being discussed today none that we think will get done but at least it's a discussion that's happening yeah what was the limit you said 54 000 54 000 milligrams every 35 days so so we get about 30 respects we get a lot yeah right and that's a ton except for the with it yeah but we don't go anywhere near that no no but the 2.5 we ran out every right and that every month so um every 35 days but so that'll give you 50 and that'll count 50 something thousand milligrams in every but all over all right it doesn't delineate smoking right right so it can be in smoking right so it can be all smokable if you wanted um [Music] it's not enough flour for i don't know if the dispensers keep up with something like that yeah food buying a lot of flour yeah well it seems like the dispenser is not are not in favor of the caps no because they understand that it sends people back to the black market right why would they be in favor of a cap these types are ridiculous and the rationale is even more ridiculous yeah you know yeah that that it's going to be just like pill mills and doctors are responsible it's like the only solution to the pill mills you know right not in psychedelics psychedelics for sure come on guys um but i do think we have to wrap it up yeah because you got to get going i have to get going in a few years sounds good sounds good love you guys happy thursday happy thursday hope everybody has a wonderful day enjoy your trips enjoy your trip and thursday love you guys we'll see you tomorrow", "6-L7wO4_l6E": "why would a person pick a particular kind of vaporizer everyone's priorities are different and for someone using the vaporizer oil cartridges stealth is often the most important priority you have zero odor folks who live in apartment buildings can use the oil cartridges because they have no odor they produce no smoke for

the hospital and i feel that it's only right to um i was thinking of like mario and doesn't he like power up like go like this or something i feel like we need to like put on our power suits we're going in for cf clinic let's do this all right we're here same window cell different reasons we are checked in and i'm reminded how different it is to come to a scheduled cf appointment like oh now versus a year the last you know six years or really probably 10 years it's just it was always sick visits instead of a schedule cf clinic appointment i was thinking um i feel like since i'm just about to turn 31 this is like my healthy baby visit like when your baby turns the next year old you take them in for their like pediatrician visit because it's one year on track after i'm here well yeah and just you usually take your child a normal child like around the birthday yeah so i'm here for my healthy baby visit i mean we are very thankful that we don't have any worries about my lung function declining right now i have a home pft machine so we know that my pfts are pretty stable we're so thankful for that we do have quite a few things to talk through with the team um but as far as like my state of your lungs yeah um when we were good we're thankful to have stability there yeah when we were walking up here i was thinking like i really don't have a worry right now that my lung function is dropping but i'm sure there will be that day and um that could start to make me cry but we're not there right now i don't think so we will be thankful for today the stability that i'm having and gear up for whenever it changes um but i was thinking like same windowsill as during that transplant evaluation week which was insanity um just the number of appointments and all that these windowsills were like i think we're in that window so oh but this hallway yeah um yep the level of uncertainty and all of that what a difference to be like we're not actually worried about my stability right now and that's a very unexpected gift and it's hard to believe that was like almost a year and a half ago or a year and three months ago yeah crazy oh that's crazy the other thing that i really like about this appointment is that about two weeks ago i did lab work and my sputum sample so i don't have to get blood work today unless something crazy comes up and they want extra blood work um i really like having those things done ahead of time so because then we can talk about those results during the clinic as opposed to after the fact right mary's on top of things like that well i really appreciate being able to talk through that sort of thing so i appreciate having the results before my appointment like going into the appointment right as i usually get into the clinic room the first thing i do is sit down and then rip my mask off because i'm like oh i'm in my room i can breathe but not now everybody wears masks all the time in here so no breathing break for me until i do pfts i guess so i get to breathe when they ask me to run a marathon there you go doing pfts is super exhausting you got this you got this okay mary's in getting her pfts which is pulmonary function test if you're new around here and she has me on facetime so i can join her go mary i'm on mute she can't hear us but we're cheering for good job good finish pfts stable yes i'm finding every time i cough in the hospital setting i'm feeling like people are going to like look at me you're like it's not running like what is it two hours later yeah something like that we are done oh remember how we were hoping for clear communication and then i realized we're all gonna be wearing masks which is like a can be a communication barrier it was great we were able to talk through all the things we wanted to talk through starting some new meds headache stuff gonna do we're gonna figure stuff out oh yes so thankful oh whoo we made it to the car we took off our masks we feel like a burden is lifted off of our shoulders you know pre-clinic stress it's real also um wow i never get to cut a bracelet off you they have like they put a bracelet on you when you gets copied screened when you enter the hospital very nice color of the day today lavender okay you guys so basically we talked about all of it the fatigue i'm having some kidney weirdness the last few months talked through that i'm going to be starting a preventative headache medicine and a different like breakthrough headache medicine stuff i've never been on so we will kind of see how it goes um possibly going to see a few different specialists i mentioned how i miss i missed my ultrasound appointment for my spleen and liver and she was obviously like super understanding about that um but we do need to talk to my liver doctor and they might yeah i don't know we'll see they might be scared of that might add on like kidney imaging to see if there's anything going on there yep and lungs are stable weight is stable those things we already kind of knew um she this was really like you know when somebody validates how you feel it goes so far if somebody's like oh i hear you and that would be difficult so my doctor pulled up my cat my last cat scan of my abdomen like my liver my spleen and nobody's ever shown me how squished my abdominal cavity is and she was like look at this and she was showing us the cat scan she was showing us how big a liver is supposed to be how like it's reaching so much of my abdominal cavity and my spleen is obviously humongous and she showed me how my stomach is squished in between my liver and my spleen and was like basically saying to me if you don't have an appetite this is why yeah like wow pictorial evidence of why i'm not hungry all the time so anyway that was just like oh that's so interesting so squishy abdominal area but that's nothing's new like liver and spleen have always been enlarged i didn't realize how enlarged my liver was so anyway all good just feeling so grateful that we did it that communication was super clear that it wasn't rushed i so appreciate that and um yep that's where we're at and now we're exiting the parking garage and let us commence with birthday week speaking of headaches that clinic headache though sometimes clinic hikes just get better when you get out of the hospital so i'm gonna breathe some deep non-hospital air and just be grateful chipotle yum take you back to chipotle after clinic in boston oh wow i forgot about that i was actually scheduled for a video visit with my immunologist so she's at that hospital or no actually a different location but they scheduled me for a video follow-up visit so it is scheduled for 1 40 today we will get home at 1 38 so that was perfect timing i already downloaded like if the video visit has to happen on my phone but hopefully i'll be able to do it on the computer so i'm gonna get home run inside and open the computer quickly okay finished my immunology appointment as well all is well done for today good job and as always we'll see you tomorrow good night [Music]", "-lNquVfmqm4": "this is actually the fourth lecture that I've given to the College on the topic of English the history of the English garden and the college supported my research when I was was Provost and it's a delight to be back here at an institution which I loved leading and for which I have continued affection and respect in those previous lectures I discussed the overall growth of English gardening since 1660 the making and running of the great gardens of the 17th and 18th centuries and the entrepreneurs who designed and built gardens or ran the nurseries which supplied them my interest in this topic stems many years back I can't even remember when from a simple question which I asked as I wandered with my wife around a huge and beautiful garden and the question was it's lovely but how much did it cost and I found that none of the thousands of books on garden history none of the guide books of the National Trust or English heritage none of the books in my own discipline of economic history answered or indeed even asked that question so I said how to answer it for myself and this book is the result it is in essence a history of the garden industry in England since 1660 or at least a lot of aspects of the garden industry I had to leave other things out I think I can claim that it is a new kind of garden history because garden history has traditionally been not concerned with the design of gardens and I'm that's not my speciality but tonight I'm going to discuss one aspect of the gardens which is the technology of gardening and its effect on our lives one might call it what gardening has done for us except that I'm not going to talk about the most important answer to that question which is the pleasure that Gardens bring to our lives and we have to remember that that pleasure is shared by millions 50 percent of the British population described themselves as gardeners it's by far the largest leisure pursuit other than watching television or reading or using the computer and there's an outdoor pursuit it Dwarfs any form of sport or other recreation so it is a very big activity and as I demonstrated in the book it's given rise to a very big industry now when when when one mentions the technology of gardening everyone thinks immediately of the lawnmower actually it was this the first working steam engine that was the first modern machine to be used in English gardens less than 25 years after its invention historians of the steam engine have failed to notice this fact wooden water wheels had been used in gardens of course for century or possibly millennia probably millennia but this metallic forerunner of the Industrial Revolution the first great machine of the modern age was a new departure savories engine was designed to pump water from mines but in the flatlands of southern England pumps were required for a different purpose and that was to power the fountains which everyone every Aris DeGray at any rate every rich person wanted to have in their gardens and Thomas Savery saw an opportunity as did his successor Thomas Newcomen savories Engine had a short life owing to a tendency to explode that by by the middle of the 17th the middle of the 18th century Newcomb his engines were we used in gardens one was being installed when the great garden designer capability Brown took up his post at Stowe for example savories engine is an example of borrowing a technology designed for originally for a different purpose the lawnmower on the other hand is an example of borrowing an idea Edwyn budding saw a cylindrical machine being used to cut the NAP off woolen cloth and he wondered if it could be applied to grass and ultimately it was and it put an end to the back-breaking task of sizing the lawns of our stately homes this is at Hartwell house in Buckinghamshire as we savor his engine but anxiety took decades to be perfected a future often neglected of a great deal of innovation in his case he had to adapt a stationary machine cutting wool in a factory to become a mobile machine and there was a big problem in making a machine that was sturdy enough to do the job but also light enough to be maneuvered around a lawn the initial solution was a horse pulling while a man pushed and guided the machine the machines themselves were very expensive early models cost the modern equivalent of eight to ten thousand pounds not including the horse whose leather shoes incidentally which you can just about see in this picture because the horse had to wear leather shoes to protect the lawn otherwise it would have cut up the lawn obviously it's leather shoes alone cost him in one advertisement 660 pounds in modern currency so an expensive activity so you've got pumping engines and mowing machines technologies from borrowed from other activity which assisted the Gardeners of England but I actually want to discuss three technologies that emerge from gardens to have much wider ramifications in all our lives they're concerned with water with fire and with light economists often find it difficult to explain the processes of invention despite decades of research into it invention is when as defined as when the germ of an idea emerges and then innovation is defined as the turning that germ of an idea into reality explaining invention can be like trying to explain the music of Mozart or the writing of Jane Austen innovation is somewhat easier often one can chart the course of an innovation through a complex interaction of the idea the invention and then the supply and demand for the ultimate product but there are always problems because you can often argue that a new technology could have appeared by some other means than it actually did but what I'm going to do this evening is to follow what actually occurred and to look firstly at water when charles ii took up his throne in May 1660 he had quite a lot of things to do he had to reestablish his monarchy reassure the Church of England which was still suspicious of his because the Catholic roots appoint ministers placate people seeking jobs at court and pursue the Regicides but he had another priority gardening and soon after his return to England he set unemployed soldiers to work to dig a rectangular lake which he called a canal instant James's Park and you can see it on this slide this was long before the building of the transport canals of the 18th century his canal was big it was 850 yards long by 42 yards wide and when it was complete it looked like this and evylyn and peeps record how fond the king was of wandering in the lake wandering around the lake and they particularly record how charles ii and his new Queen Catherine of Braganza walked in the park in the winter of 1660 1661 to watch the sliders skaters a new invention introduced from Holland on the lake as well as to see the waterfowl the pelicans introduced by Charles are still of course a feature of the lake although it's been altered since these pictures into its modern sinuous form in the early 19th century but there are no longer vultures golden eagles cassowaries and ostriches which he also imported but apart from the menageries which were of an important feature of 18th 17th and 18th century gardens and the waterfowl water is a really essential feature of English gardening charles ii soon also created long water at hampton court and his successors constructed similar water features as they would now be called a kensington palace but the real growth of lake building across the country took place in the gardens of the aristocracy as they emulated their kings and their queens and by the end of the 17th century 30 or 40 years after the restoration 40 years after restoration decorative canals of various sizes and shapes but mostly rectangular almost all rectangular had been dug all over the country and soon they were embellished with garden buildings as with the beautiful thomas archer pavilion rest park in the for sure this picture illustrates one of the main aims of waterworks at this period which was the creation of reflections they sometimes resorted to even more amazing feats of engineering to create water meadows to provide even greater opportunities for reflections this is in Bedford sure but in the Midlands and Derbyshire Chatsworth soon had its canal this is the picture modern picture of the great emperor fountain which was placed there in the 1840s but the canal and the fountain were there as early as 1675 and the canal complemented the other great water feature at Chatsworth the cascade built by the French engineer Gris a for the first Duke of Devonshire it was and is fed by pipes from a nine acre reservoir in the hills high above the house and garden but the apogee of early eighteenth-century water engineering was further north at Studley royal in yorkshire this was the creation of join as Li Basel abhi who was the Chancellor of the Exchequer disgraced and at one point imprisoned in the tower as a result of his part in the great financial scandal of the South Sea Bubble he was fined a very large sum of money but still had an awful lot left and he created what is still I think the greatest water garden in England at Starly royal it was complemented when later in the 18th century his son acquired the ruins of fountains abbey higher up the valley now I could go on in this way showing you beautiful pictures of English gardens but you may already be asking what on earth has this got to do with technology the answer is that these waterworks and many others around the country were feats of civil engineering Seve feats of civil engineering and in the process they transformed our countryside they were complex creations and their most important and complex features were the twin technologies of a dam building and of puddling which I'll come back to in a minute which together made the canals and lakes watertight but it's crucial to realize that there are few if any natural lakes in England south of the Lake District of Cumbria the lakes which adorn the south and the Midlands and up into Yorkshire in this case are artificial they're man-made although very few people realize that most people who tour these gardens think of them as natural features of the landscape they aren't nor of course are the reservoirs which followed them using the same technologies in the 19th and 20th centuries and nor of course are the the gravel pits which have become other water features in the mostly in the 20th century now these canals and lakes of the earlier period the 17th and 18th centuries were formed in one of two ways the first way which was used in James's Park in Hampton Court and many many others was to dig the canal out by hand often they linked together earlier and this happened in to James's Park earlier artificially created ponds often usually for fish fish ponds but of course if you dig out of a canal of the kind that I've shown you earlier you've got to supply the water so you have to have a piped water system from a convenient hopefully water source that's one way of creating these Lakes the second was to dam a stream if you could find a convenient stream on your land and wait for the water to fill the area above the dam it was more complex than that because of course the water can't be stagnant it has to flow and therefore you have to create means of getting the water in at one end and out of the other all this work used huge quantities of labour most of the canals weren't very deep but if you work out how big and how deep for example the lake at hampton court was it meant digging up and carting away about half a million barrow loads of soil and then making the whole thing watertight as I'll come back to building a dam without any machinery of course was equally arduous and this diagram shows the construction method used by the great landscape architect Lancelot Brown at Petworth and essentially it is the method used in most of if not all of the dams of the 18th century and for considerable long periods afterwards so what you're doing is piling up soil on the left-hand side and then on the water side reinforcing that soil with clay sand and stone to hold the water back and you can see also a feature of many of designs of the lakes which demonstrate how artificial they are if you like the oak draw the centre which meant that you could raise or lower raise and lower a door in order to drain the lake or to reduce the water level why would you drain a lake well there are two reasons for doing that the first is to remove the silt which builds up in the lakes and I'll come back to that one the second was to make it easier to net the fish dams of this kind developed and the technology has developed exclusively for Gardens become ubiquitous and they were used essentially this method to construct the reservoirs which tops out water levels in transport canals and that such as the dam of Whaley bridge which nearly collapsed in the last few months so the technology is developed in the gardens but because it is developed in the gardens it has to be unobtrusive the garden dams were not meant to be obvious they were meant these Lakes to look like natural features and the dams are often actually quite difficult to find this is Browns dam at Blenheim stretching to the trees in the distance and looking as it was intended to do like a river bank behind the photographer is another feature of March eighteenth century water engineering the cascade entirely artificial it's the outlet from the lake and in order to let the water flow which has been turned at blenheim into an entirely artificial foaming cascade which is actually one of the great attractions of the the gardens at Blenheim Palace now both Dam and cascade have to hold back an immense weight of water here you can see the lower the southern part of the plenum lake with the cascade at the bottom and the palace in the top right-hand corner but there's quite a lot of the lake to the north above the top of this picture so you can see that holding back the water of a hundred and fifty acres the lake of one hundred and fifty acres is a major civil engineering task few lakes are as large I don't think any as as large as 150 acres of the blenheim lake but some dams were much much longer at Combe Abbey and Warwickshire for example the dam stretched for half a mile many lakes were designed by brown to imitate a slow flowing and winding river others had more complex shapes and this is one example the two lakes and canals I would on in Buckinghamshire one of the least known but in many ways one of the most interesting of landscapes attributed to Brown here you've got two bodies of water down here sorry this is rather difficult and here which are actually at different levels and flow in different directions so you've got a dam here and another dam here down here so it's difficult to control the pointer and they're connected by another artificial feature the canal in the middle with the engineering carefully concealed under bridges and boat houses and your eye is taken away from the engineering if you like by these eye catchers temples and other constructions in the in the next to the lake I'll just go back for a second one point to notice is how huge these constructions are in relation to the houses which they accompany and that's where what in house is it's now the stable block or the carriage house is where Tony Blair now his country residence but you can see how small essentially it is compared to the huge scale of the great garden the artifice of these Lakes which we now think of as I says as natural features although they're not also of course depended on making the watertight where they're not on already impermeable soils because lakes which leak aren't much use some of Browns lakes did leak there's one account I think at Harwood of a hole big enough to drown a horse in from which the water was leaking but if you got it right then you could make these Lakes leak proof and the technique for doing that is another important part of civil engineering developed in gardens is paddling paddling is seen here being used to restore a canal bed because many if not most of the canals are puddled there puddling puddles a linings are produced by beating clay with large hammers and then laying it layer by layer you could often have eight layers interspersed with lime and stones to form an impermeable base and the sides for the canal because the it not only had to hold water in but it had to repel rodents who might try and burrow into it and make it leak sometimes oxen will use to trample down the clay at Lake patroller in Rajasthan in the 14th century they used elephants Brown mostly used humans equipped with special spades for the purpose now the importance of this invention the puddling or this use of puddling is that canal historians and civil engineers usually attribute the technique of puddling to james Brindley the great canal builder of the 18th century but that's nonsense it had been used in gardens at least a century before it may in fact be a roman technique but it was certainly brought to perfection in England in the canals the rectangular ponds of the gardens of English and of course also in French our aristocrats and only later transferred to the building of the transport canals of the Industrial Revolution Brindell is Bridgewater canal which was the first example didn't open a little 1761 decades after the Garden waterworks which I have described puddling was used to waterproof the hundred and fifty acres of the Blenheim Lake Browne had to use a hundred workmen for three years to do it and it cost the 4th Duke of Marlborough about 35 million pounds in modern values and this is a part of the result a drowning as Brown did part of the van borough bridge from the an earlier period when it also had a rectangular canal if you think 35 million is an exaggerated figure then look at the fact that Blenheim is about to drain the pond the Queen's pond at the far side of the bridge to remove the silt from that part of the lake and that is going to cost 6 million pounds to do so the point I'm making is that the lakes of England and the reservoirs which use that the technology transformed our landscape it's extraordinary however that these huge civil engineering works have been ignored by historians of Technology and of engineering a recent book produced by the royal institution of civil engineers doesn't mention garden works at all so lakes are the first of my three technological legacies of English gardening the second technological legacy began much more unobtrusively this is an illustration from a book by the writer and gardener Johnny vlinn darest published in 1691 and it's of a greenhouse greenhouses came into use in northern in Europe during the 17th century as houses in which to keep the greens those were the citrus trees and other tender plants beloved by the Renaissance gardeners of Italy but they were tender and they were wood needed protection during northern winters greenhouses were initially rudimentary temporary structures but soon became larger and permanent but the point of this lick if this picture is to illustrate the fact the evening's greenhouse is the earliest English example of the second innovation from gardens which has changed our lives and that is central heating and you can see that hot air sorry wrong way hot air from the boiler is taken in pipes under the building to heat the heat the greenhouse greenhouses rapidly became more elaborate as here at Kensington Palace and the term Orangery began to be used for them even such structures much more substantial structures couldn't keep the greens warm enough to survive the winter and heating was needed at first at the same time as evenings in invention charcoal brazzers were often used but these had a problem their fumes poisoned both the plants and in some cases the gardener's and that's why John evylyn and others divided devise greenhouses with indirect heating sources the boilers outside the greenhouses feeding hot air through pipe systems into the houses now again like puddling this isn't really a new technology because as I'm sure many of you will realize that's how the Roman hyper course worked but it was the first use of that technology for about 1,200 years in England it was also used in gardens for at least a century before it was installed in industrial buildings in England and 2 or even 3 centuries before it was used in domestic in the domestic house there was central heating both inside and outside the gardens this is a hot wall if you go to some of the large walled kitchen gardens which are being lovingly restored by people with a very great deal of money around the country many of them incorporate usually across the middle of the walled garden a wall which incorporates boilers and flues heating the wall and warming the air around the fruit trees planted along it although hot air and latest steam systems were used in greenhouses during the 18th century a massive development of heating technologies followed in the 19th century in the greenhouses of the period using hot water in iron pipes I mean this was to pioneered in houses such as this at Kew initially the pipes were huge four to six inches in diameter which may be one reason why they were slow to be adopted in domestic houses but small bore pipes were soon developed for the gardens the first installation was for a governor of the Bank of England in the 1820s or 1830s and they were adopted in hundreds and thousands or tens of thousands of green houses across the country greenhouses conservatories and orange trees and the people who developed these heating systems such as this Glasgow engineering firm soon during the course of the 18th of the 19th century moved from producing central heating systems for plants to producing central heating systems for houses Henry Hope of Birmingham which became the firm crit all Hope which many of you will have experienced was another firm at the period which whose accounts show a gradual transition from the garden to the house from heating plants to heating people but it did take a very long time why one reason I think is that plants can't put on and take off their clothes in order to keep warm or to keep cool nor can you usually except at great expense move them closer to or further from a fire but there's another reason which was given by Deborah the late Dowager Duchess of Devonshire she was asked why the greenhouses at Chatsworth were heated for two centuries before central heating was installed in the great house one had to realize she said the plants were much more important than people so central heating is my second legacy of English Gardens the third legacy also is illustrated by the greenhouses the buildings of light and air which are now such a feature of many of our towns and cities this is an early green house this would have been something like the greenhouses which were installed at Hampton Court to take Queen Mary's botanical collection brought over from Holland after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 these early greenhouses have a problem they were suitable for keeping greens alive during the winter particularly heated but not for nurturing plants and as the plant collectors found out across the world in particular across North America in the early 18th century and the plants came back and needed to be nurtured in English conditions gardeners began to realize that you needed more than warmth you actually needed light and air to make the plants grow so it became necessary to build larger and larger permanent constructions providing more light and also to having windows which could be opened and closed because ventilation was as important as heating now to the men of taste and gardening was seen as an important aspect of your taste in the 18th century so the men have taste who are paying for the gardens permanent buildings had to look good we should always remember that gardens and greenhouses were as much a part of luxury consumption and show as rolling grassland or sinuous Lakes so the next generation of greenhouses were built like the example at Kensington Palace which I showed you earlier or this later conservatory at Warwick Castle according to the tenets of classical architecture there was a side benefit which was that it was soon realized that conservatories and oranges and greenhouses could be used by people as well as plants from the middle of the 18th century to the end of the 19th century and again it's probably true today no garden is complete without its conservatory and a very large industry was created to make them aware of course many uses for conservatories of which Victorian novels tell us amorous encounters were an important aspect the sometimes the result of building conservatories is overwhelming this was the conservatory at Carleton house on the site which is now called Carlton house Gardens where the British Academy and the Athenaeum and the Royal Society now are and it was created as you can see in 1811 for 1812 and demolished in the 1820s with the rest of Carlton house in order to pay for the works around Regent Street note that this amazing building is entirely devoid of plants and there's a good reason for that because a plant would have had to be very Hardy and sturdy indeed to grow without much light which you don't get through these windows and with the smoke pollution which hung over London but there was a more fundamental technical problem which afflict 'add all the 18th century greenhouses they had very small panes of glass this wasn't as I sometimes thought because of the window tax because the window tax didn't apply to garden buildings nor of the glass tank because glass wasn't any more expensive than brick which was the alternative in construction it sprang from the technical problems of making large glass sheets and of supporting them on glazing bars particularly since some of them had to be open about to get air as I said to the plants the first answer came early in the 19th century from the garden designer and writer he was really a gardening polymath caught John Claudius Loudon he devised a method of supporting glass panes on curved roarton glazing bars and another method known as Ridge and Ferro glazing which allowed maximum light to pass through the pass through the light to the plants and this is an example of his designs at lodges which was a essentially a large garden centre in Hackney in the 1820s with greenhouses which in some cases were even bigger than this other greenhouses but it's still using relatively small panes but it is one of the first examples of glass and iron construction later of course transmuted into steel construction which has become such a ubiquitous feature of our towns and cities there's actually another important feature of Louden's designs which is that the glazing bars were interchangeable this seems obvious to us if you're going to build something like this you'd make all the the components the same that actually the first manufacturer and use of interchangeable parts had only been ten years before this in the portsmouth dockyard during the Napoleonic Wars so as with the steam engine gardens are in the warfront of technological innovation another innovation which has changed our lives which is mass production other examples soon followed this picture it isn't a very good one unfortunately it's the only one we seem to have got is of the anthem in Hove which was intended to be an early 19th century version of the Eden Project it was intended I say intended because although the architect had designed it with a central arm pillar supporting the entire structure the builders this is a familiar story decided to do dispense with that essential element of the design and the building collapsed entirely as soon as its scaffolding was removed the remains of it actually continued to be a tourist attraction in Brighton for about the next 40 or 50 years another architect offered to rebuild it and this gives you a sense of the amount of money that's being spent for eight million pounds in modern terms but that was refused so we didn't have it but the anthem shows how much glass and metal construction could achieve that is if you didn't remove the supporting pillar other enormous that perhaps slightly lessen ambitious uses of the technology although sometimes with the wood instead of iron followed from this this was the great stove at Chatsworth a stove call because green houses had stoves in them built by Joseph Paxton for the 6th Duke of Devonshire it was then the largest green house ever built although it was later surpassed by some of the green houses at Kew it was equipped with a tunnel which one can still walk through to carry the coal which fueled its its boilers without the visitors to the great estate at Chatsworth being troubled by such mundane features and it was large enough for Queen Victoria to drive through it in her carriage there were more conventional greenhouses of the period built for plants rather than people as in the Magnificent Royal kitchen gardens at Frogmore near Windsor built in 1830s 1840s at a cost of the modern values of 33 million pounds the greenhouses contributed quite a lot of that now by the this period in fact chance Brothers had developed a method of making larger glass panes and that made possible even larger structures and this of course is the apogee of the new construction methods Paxton's Crystal Palace for the 1851 exhibition it wasn't actually based on the design for the Jade grant John stove that on another earlier green house at Chatsworth much of it was actually made from glass and wood in its first incarnation in Hyde Park but it was still based on the mass production of interchangeable parts we used to delays in the production of great infrastructure projects in this country Paxton built the Crystal Palace in five months by using interchangeable parts England was at the forefront of this technology acknowledged as the leader in great greenhouse and conservatory design and construction but others soon followed this is Logan Palais in Paris built for the exhibition at the end of the century but it was soon applied the technology was soon applied to other forms of building this is a building in Liverpool the first steel framed and glass curtain wall building you wouldn't probably recognize it as such because the steel is being concealed by the stone but that was built by Peter Ella since 1864 and particularly in the United States much larger buildings using the technology became possible and this is one of the earliest skyscrapers again based on exactly the same technology the combination of metal and glass construction now back in the country which it began can be seen in buildings such as this and so many others around us in the City of London now let me conclude tracing the course of a new technology from its invention to its adoption is never easy as I said earlier much depends on serendipity the kind which leaded when budding to adopt an idea idea from cloth production much depends on a whole series of small modifications for original designs modifications usually made by skilled workmen and women rather than by the grand inventors who get all the publicity and the credit and often that takes a very long time as the example of the the green of the lawn mara shows you're talking about decades in which to develop these technologies it's always possible as I said to argue that a new technology would have occurred anyway or at least that it came about by a different route but the fact remains that it was the technology of dam building in the service of the lakes of the aristocrats of the Stewart and Hanoverian period which to the technology pressed into use in our canals and our reservoirs so the lakes became fundamental to our way of life as well as changing the entire shape of the English landscape it was the greenhouses of Stewart England which began the development of central heating which has also affected our lives altered our lives and it was those greenhouses which ultimately gave us the skyscrapers which love them although them now transform our cities behind all this are talented individuals talented workers and above all to the growth of that neglected British industry the garden industry now responsible for 11 or 12 billion pounds a year but to find out more about that you'll have to read my book [Applause]", "0ajQyY6OVb8": "There's no easy way to say this, so I'm\njust gonna put it out there: most

However, amigos, if you keep your cool, and don't rush your\nplants through these key early stages, I promise that they will deliver far\nbigger yields further down the line. If you're growing hydroponically and\nhaven't tried stonewool cubes and blocks yet, what's wrong with you? Just\nkidding. They're hard to beat, especially for the propagation stage. Stonewool is\nclean, consistent, easy to use, and ideal for creating homogenous batches of\nhealthy plants for all types of hydroponic techniques. Yes you do have to\npre-soak stone wool before use. The one-step approach is to use a mild\nvegetative hydroponic nutrient solution at around pH 5.5 to 5.8, and let the stonewool soak for between 1 and 15 minutes. The larger the blocks are, longer the\nsoak time. Now, some growers prefer a two-step approach: firstly soak in a pH\n5.5 water, then they perform a second soak in a mild nutrient solution. Now,\nthis two-step approach will arguably provide more pH stability in the stonewool, as pure water will remove any residual lime more effectively. Be sure\nto allow the blocks a chance to fully drain before use. I like to shake out\nsome of the excess solution, rather than squeezing it, as it's too easy to\ncompact the stone wool fibers, and damage the micro pores which the roots love so\nmuch. Now, when growing like this, always start seedlings and cuttings in a\npropagator. Once you see a root or a few pairs of\ntrue leaves, it's time to wean them off the warm and humid environment inside\nthe propagator, and prepare them for the real world of your bedroom. We call this\nprocess \"hardening off.\" Open the vents in the lid, then move on to leaving it at a\nslight angle to allow more airflow, and to slowly reduce the relative humidity\nand temperature inside the propagator. After a few days the lid can be removed\ncompletely and the plants will have become more acclimated to their new\nenvironment. For young, vegetative plants I aim to keep daytime temperatures\nbetween 73 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit. That's 23 to 26 degrees Celsius, for you\nsensible metric people, and lights on for 18 hours a day. Some growers choose a 24\nhour cycle, as it's easier to maintain consistent temperatures, but your plants\nwill thank you for the short rest. The ideal relative humidity for juvenile\nplants is between 65 to 75%. This promotes a lower transpiration rate,\nwhich in turn will allow your young plants to concentrate their energy on\nroot and leaf growth. Most growers use T5 fluorescent lighting, or LED lighting at\nthis stage; although, an LEC 315 is also great option. As far as irrigation is\nconcerned, follow the 50% rule. Young plants are very sensitive to both overly\nwet and dry conditions. Don't robotically dip your cubes every\nday, or leave them standing in water. Wait until they dried out at least by\nhalf before redipping. Stonewool feels very light when it's dry, and often looks\nlighter in color. If you take just one thing away from this, it's the importance\nof air-pruning young plants. I'm not necessarily talking about fabric pots, or\nspecialist air-pruning pots, either. Air- pruning is a really simple technique\nthat stops root growth from extending beyond it's growing media by exposing\nthe roots to relatively dry air. When propagating with stonewool blocks, the plants'\nfirst primary roots will grow down through the block until the tips grow out\nthe bottom. Once the primary root tips are exposed to the relatively dry air,\nthey will stop growing and die back. I know how that sounds, but it's actually a\ngood thing. As these primary roots now have nowhere else to grow, it stimulates\nan abundance of secondary roots to branch out from them, and these secondary\nroots will then spread through the block until they to get air-pruned and\nstimulate yet more root branching. The overall effect of this growth and\npruning cycle will create a plant with a well-developed root system throughout\nthe entire block. Air-prune plants will literally explode with root growth when\nthey are transplanted into their final hydroponic system. In practice, all that's\ninvolved with air-pruning is setting your blocks up off the grow tray so that\nair can circulate beneath. Grodan makes an awesome Grow Smart tray, specifically\nfor this purpose. It can accommodate both the A-OK starter plugs and larger blocks,\nbut you can fashion something yourself by using a wire mesh, or appropriating\na rack from your oven. The key is getting air circulating beneath the blocks. This\nconcentrates and contains the roots within the propagation media itself,\nforcing the roots to explode every nook and cranny available to them. A lot of\ngrowers mistakenly believe that the first sign of roots out of the bottom of\nthe block is thier que to move on to the next stage, and actually that's the last\nthing you want to do. All this will do is produce plants with a few long roots\ncoming through empty stonewool blocks. They'll also be more likely to be set\nback when planted, as the lack of root mass within the block will not be able\nto cope with the frequent irrigations, and large volume of water held by the\nblock. Inevitably, this will cause the plants' health and\ngrowth rate to suffer through over watering. This scenario is very common\nwith growers using the nutrient film technique, or NFT. Don't rush those plants\ninto the NFT system! The aim of the game is to create a bunch of plants with an\nabundance of roots filling the internal\nstructure of the stonewool block before planting them out. And this, amigos, is\nwhat air pruning is all about. Thanks for watching, and please don't forget to\nsubscribe.

what's up sebastian here so let's start with the first book and it's ted reads syncopation it is a great book to develop your independence and your reading skills i personally learned how to play jazz with that book but there's a little catch to it and actually it's just a reading book and you have to know the systems that you can apply in order you know to develop your independence and so on so get a good drum teacher and he or she will show you how to work with that book second book on my list is charlie wilcoxson's all-american drummer it's a fantastic book and it also works for non-american drummers this book is essentially a collection of all or almost all rudiments put into different solos what i love about this book is that you can play it almost everywhere on a pad or you know on your lap or whatever if you got your sticks or without sticks you can practice all the exercises it helps you to build better hands to be more creative more precise and to have more dynamics on a drum set what i would recommend to you is to play all those exercises on a snare drum not only on the practice pad in order to develop your muscles you'll definitely see a huge improvement in your hands over time and last but not least is david gerbaldi's future sounds [Music] this book is all about linear drumming and dynamics it's a more funk based book and it will teach you a lot about ghost notes and linear grooves so if you want to improve your groove and your sound this book is a must alright i hope you enjoyed that small video i'm always eager to learn so let me know what are your favorite drum books leave a comment down below and i see you soon bye you", "qo4T9sXj4p8": "[Music] hey everybody this is Jason Wilson with the curious about cannabis podcast thanks so much for tuning in once again so today I'm joined with Murphy Murray a fellow cannabis educator and also a cannabis extraction consultant and today we're gonna be talking all about well see what we get into but primarily cannabis extraction thanks so much Murphy for being willing to come on the podcast yeah absolutely thank you yeah I'm really stoked we are pad sat and crossed before now so this has kind of been long awaited for me as far as I followed some of your work and senior classes like from a distance so it's cool to finally connect and and talk about common interests for those that aren't familiar with some of your work and your backgrounds kind of diverse and do you mind kind of sharing just a little bit about some of that background and what led you into getting into specifically like the cannabis chemistry and extraction and all of the work that you're kind of focusing on now yeah sure I started in the cannabis industry when it was fledgling in Colorado so we had the caregiver structure in 2009 and we started seeing retail dispensaries open up but there wasn't licensing for it and it still kind of mimicked what California has going on in at the time in a lot of ways and so um you know I got involved on the retail end I lived in the Vale Valley and we wanted to sell high-end cannabis products to those high-end medical patients and in 2010 licensing started and in Colorado that meant vertical integration so being from a marketing background and working on the retail side of things I had no preparation for an extraction lab and certainly no preparation for a large-scale consult cultivation and so it was all just something that was kind of thrown at us and we had to get involved I did my best to delegate where I could but the was one of the hardest ones to to delegate out because there you know a lot of people had grown for decades yeah but there wasn't much for extraction historically um you know like a lot of people were doing bubble hash but that is not even you know in the same department especially at the time you know we were we were just starting to see things like amber glass which is like a shadow made for methanol you know and we were starting to see the butane honey oil and we were still really just calling it honey oil at the time and not even really referencing how it was being made because everything was still a big secret yeah for a really long time which is part of the reason why education is so important to me because the first three to four years of my cannabis career especially in the extraction world there was nowhere to get good information there was a couple of hard to navigate forums with a lot of code words and screen names and um it was really difficult to use that information in a practical way and not having that chemistry background you know was certainly a disadvantage but at that time we weren't doing chemistry we were barely extracting you know material we were leaving a lot of cannabinoids behind we were not purifying anything and we had no analytical testing to support it so you know the concentrates that we made we had no potency data on we had no pesticide data we had no heavy-metal testing we you know I couldn't tell you how many milligrams of THC or anything else it was all anecdotal it was all descriptive and you know I look back at that and just get anxious about all of the products that I made and sold that I wouldn't do today because we just didn't have the tools so you know fast forward a few more years and the internet makes things a lot easier you know ten years is a long time in terms of internet development and so more information became accessible which is good and bad a lot of bad information became accessible but what is more relevant is that we have the social media aspect of it and so now I could actually network with real humans and as more states became legalized people were less afraid to actually share what they were doing and like real consultant jobs started becoming a thing and so we started to talk a lot more and develop methods and that's where I kind of got into the extraction space um you know in a very much more serious way because we started to actually have real standards to pursue and I had started to meet the type of people who were doing things that I wanted to emulate and from there I got involved on the equipment end of things in 2014 I started working for extraction tech solutions which was one of the only hydrocarbon equipment manufacturers at the time and I started doing private consulting from there I just became fully immersed in in the world of extraction so from you know just straight-up cannabis extraction to also the burgeoning hemp industry yeah and you know we've just kind of gone all the way from black oil to white powder right you know you know the last few years yeah that's it'd be fascinating to kind of see that laid out on an image timeline that's my facebook memories can be scary anytime what is it that particularly about extraction now that's really driving your passion to kind of continue that focus and that arm of things I think one of my favorite things about extraction has always been that you know it's it's very objective you know once we started bringing out a little testing into it and started actually doing chemistry in the labs it was really rewarding because I could perform a process I could get results and I could repeat those results um you know and compare that to like cultivation where the you know every step you take today you'll see the results of that weeks months ahead of you know that point so there's no instant gratification cultivation whereas extraction is instant gratification every 30 minutes I get to see the results of what I've achieved and so it feels very productive and it also gives me a lot of room for error which is very exciting for me because I love the experimentation of it yeah with the cultivation even just having a table that you try out new nutrients on can affect literally the rest of the garden whereas with extraction I can have a new idea I can try a new piece of equipment I can tweak a process I can make these changes you know minute to minute day to day and get to evaluate the efficiency and so the potential for growth is just phenomenal because it's exponential every single day I can try something new and you know every new test result gives me 10 more questions to go chase down the rabbit hole so it is constant change and very fast moving which I find personally rewarding I'm the type of person that rearranges my furniture often right you change yeah and extraction is nothing but change yeah yeah I could see that would be really exciting to be caught up in that cell rated process of refinement refinement of technologies and process and everything you really get to see it unfold in a way that that's unique when you were learning about extraction what were some of the resources that you found most valuable to kind of understand what you needed to do to take things to that that next level I know skunk farm is obviously one resource that we all probably know pretty well that's a huge one or some others that you found yeah I mean those those online forums were enormous but through those online forums I actually got to meet really competent people and I think both 10 years ago and even today the mentorship for finding someone smarter and better than you yeah is the most valuable like I look back on my career to some specific individuals who brought me in and we're willing to you know share what at the time was like trade secrets you know like the the things that we just didn't discuss out loud in part because it was illegal but also in part you know to keep our brands in a unique and those people were enormous for me I had a couple of chemists who were involved early on that were really helpful in explaining some of like the basic safety issues that I would never have even thought to ask questions about probably without their help not to mention just some you know industry pioneers people like Nick tanum of essential extracts who you know was willing to teach me how to make bubble hash in his kitchen and you know they get me involved in this industry when it was still barely an industry you know we were barely for-profit at the time right yeah yeah that's I think that's really really good advice to anybody listening that's trying to figure out how to kind of break into the space I've always been a fan of mentorship too that's and that's how I've gotten to where I am as well it's like I can think of like really three key people that you know I just happen to sort of serendipitously come across that felt comfortable and taught me things or gave me chances that all of a sudden you know progress into things you can't imagine yeah absolutely and we all we all learn that way there's this common misconception in cannabis that like you've just got to be good at it right some of us are just gonna like stumble into a garden get gifted the right clone and the rest of its gravy you know yeah or like there's some kind of magic secret to it but really like I've got one math teacher who made algebra click for me like I remember two English teachers that you know made an impact on my love of literature or my language today most of the time like we need someone else to help us you know cultivate our passion and and I think that's really valuable you know for example the person who started my extraction career you know Nicholas tan he works in a completely different section of the industry now you know like I learning under him um you know kind of gave me the insight that I needed to know where I wanted to go and that it was different you know like you know these kinds of lessons are something that I wouldn't have learned if I didn't get that exposure early on and you know that's as an educator that's one thing that I see most in students is that people think that it's supposed to come easily mm-hmm but most of the time if you're going to learn something you need a teacher a nice perfectly okay you know so seek out a mentor that you can have those open conversations with it's so enormous ly helpful like the internet is still just talking to a wall yeah yeah it is you know like absolutely Liz too much information if I ask my friend what to Google they're gonna give me a better search words right right ya know it's a really good point and a big part of the role of a mentor is sort of helping you craft perspective and so you know when you work with someone like that that's knowledgeable you walk away seeing things just totally different and so you recognize different opportunities that you would have never seen before or recognized you're where you fit I guess you know into a grander scheme of things that can be really really valuable yeah how did your what sort of extraction technologies did you work with along the way you've mentioned a couple but I know isn't your focus now primarily on liquid hydrocarbons is that right yeah absolutely so my focus since about 2011 has been you know exclusively butane and propane part of that comes from the the trends in the industry you know most of the smokeable products on the shelves are originating from butane and propane because it's one of the few methods of extraction that allows us to preserve the acid form of our cannabinoids yeah on decoy box elated products which I think you're gonna hear a lot more about in terms of you know medical applications over the next year here so I've been you know predominantly focused on that however the development of the hemp industry called for larger scale than butane and propane is currently poised to accommodate so I had to come back to ethanol extraction in a much more sophisticated way than the ethanol extraction that I started with you know many years ago so you know while I got into it with you know the most accessible stuff you know just straight-up bubble bags and water hash I've been on the combustible solvent end of things for most of my cannabis career yeah and one of the I guess issues that people usually raised with hydrocarbons is the safety issue so and you mentioned earlier that that was a big part of your learning is trying to figure out how to do a lot of this work safely so what are some of those key safety issues that you have to be aware of working in that environment and what do you do to mitigate those sure well I mean the the first thing that I've got to bring up is um you know that we we have to respect the chemical solvents that work yeah and I think that one thing most people getting into the industry don't take the time to value and appreciate is just reading a simple MSDS sheet you know reading the warnings literally on the labels you know products that we use because a lot of times a person shows us how to do something and then we just try to repeat their process and we don't try to even give ourselves the whole picture um you know it's kind of like when you learn to drive a car like someone teaches you how to you know hit the gas and hit the brake but you don't necessarily learn how the engine works right if you did understand how the engine works you'd be a better driver you know um but a lot of times we leave that first part of the puzzle out and we just teach everyone to be operators which is not quite enough information I'm one of the few people that I have met with the number of years of experience that I do in extraction that didn't start with open blasting these solvents I always operated within a closed system I never it never occurred to me to get involved in open blasting because the first thing I understood about my solvent was that it was highly combustible and so I needed to protect myself from it right and so my career has always been you know on that equipment in that technology side because it just came to me as a given you know the people who first introduced me to solvent based extraction showed me co2 extractors and you know closed ethanol systems and so it just never occurred to me to go any other route I started right out with that understanding of like every new solvent you need to read what it says because some solvents are poisonous and make you die and some solvents are just flammable and so then they're dangerous and some things are a nerd and not a big deal and understanding the difference between them is your life right yeah you know that's a the issue of needing to read the safety data sheets is something that's come up in multiple ways in my world because on the extraction world and also in the product manufacturing world just for trying to understand the safety of ingredients that are going into cannabis products so there's been I don't know I've seen multiple examples on Instagram where someone will actually post a safety data sheet and claim that like look how safe this is because it's grass and then you look at the intended uses and it's like topical application like maybe hasn't even been studied you know to be consumed or inhaled or something like that so yeah I think that's a really good recommendation starts actually read your safety data sheets for your materials or handling is the most accessible information in the world and so without it you know you're absolutely at a disadvantage just from day one you know one thing that I always recommend even with like cleaning products or dry materials is that you've got to pay attention you know to like the cleanup procedures to the newest procedures one thing a lot of gardens are very guilty of is improper waste disposal and nobody talks about it because no one read the information that said this is really harmful to just dispose of and put down the drain yeah yeah so much of that's dangerous to aquatic wildlife right yeah you know you lose the biodiversity of life in a river stream then you're you're destroying the quality of your water overall no absolutely and in the same ways that you know paying attention to what you put into your waist when you're growing can actually help you make better decisions with regards to what you put into your plants we can have that same perspective on efficiencies in the lab if we pay attention to the waste disposal because paying attention to that waste is actually what inspires the equipment manufacturers to invest in better solvent recovery right now it's all about you know on one hand keeping yourself safe but on the other hand being a good steward of the planet and finding you know a commercial or industrial application that doesn't just save you money doesn't just keep people safe but actually you know reduces harm across the pool yeah yeah and how would you describe given that you've kind of been around all of these different extraction types how would you briefly summarize some of the pros and cons to those different extraction methods like what's sort of driving those decisions of why people are choosing one over the other co2 / hydrocarbons or / ethanol sure so the first question that everyone has to ask themselves is what do you want to make yeah your end product is really important and a really quick and easy way to simplify that is does your final product need to have the original terpene and flavor profile from the plant yes or no and you know yes to that answer means that you're looking at co2 or liquid hydrocarbons if it's a no then you can look at co2 liquid hydrocarbons or potentially ethanol or heptane or you know some of these other products if you the other question you have to ask yourself is what type of cannabinoids are you looking for you need the acid form do you need those you know crystalline solids or are you looking for a decarboxylated product because certain extraction methods are also more likely to give you one or the other and so those two questions will usually shorten your list right away and so from there you know ethanol is one of the best solvents suited for scale and the reason for that is that so much ethanol extraction already exists in other industries it's considered food safe and so there are you know regulations and equipment in place that we can just straight-up copy and you know put into effect for cannabis however the boiling temperature for ethanol and you know it's interactions with water are really problematic especially depending on the qualities of your inputs and so you lose terpene content almost no matter what and you are also at risk for some degradation and some pH issues extraction of undesirable compounds like sugars and so there's a lot of things to consider that are going to lead you to first of all a decarboxylated product but also more than likely an isolated product it's going to be harder for you to have a clean oil that doesn't call for a lot of post-processing and cleanup yeah and that seems like a maybe that's a like a misconception in some circles that you would actually have like a wider diversity of some of these compounds in an ethanol extract or even a co2 extract but that's something I've run into in my own experience you know working in some of these labs in seeing like for co2 a lot of times the material is decarboxylated before it ever you know goes into the extractor and so obviously doing that process you're losing terpenes your you know anything volatile you're losing a lot of volatile especially those really lightweight ones and then with ethanol before I before I really got involved in some of this work I didn't realize how much refinement went into ethanol extracts to clean them up right and now now I've learned a lot of that pathway leads to just making distillates or isolates so yeah it's it's fascinating because before I got experience in some of this I had heard I don't know just people speaking very generally that well of course your ethanol extracts are gonna have more chemical diversity in them or with co2 you know that you can target these fractions and it's like yeah that's true but everything comes at a cost what's your each of these technologies right and so you know the the drawbacks are you know definitely very chemical but the benefit is that if you want to process 5,000 pounds or more per day of raw material ethanol is your current best option however that 5,000 pounds that you extracted that day isn't ready for sale that day right yeah it's still in solution most likely sure exactly so you know there's still more days in that final product production it if we look at co2 co2 is a very complicated product because co2 is a flexible solvent it relies completely on the operator and the equipment having a plan and sticking to it and so co2 is capable of being an excellent solvent for terpene extraction it's also capable of extracting a lot of water and wax and nonsense just depending on you know how that equipment is used and how efficient that process is a lot of people decarboxylate their material like you mentioned to avoid the water issues which means sacrificing terpene content which is a bummer because co2 is capable of doing probably one of the best jobs of a terpenes as far as solvent extraction would go but you know it comes generally with the cost of still requiring winterization and ethanol so I tend to put co2 and ethanol together because whether you make your crude with ethanol or you make it with co2 you probably are going to be following the post-processing path that's the same either way which would be that winterization and filtration and then probably most likely distillation right yeah and the exception to not going to distillate is usually still just to be in that raw oil form so maybe you might not distill but it's still only available for pens or for you know food it's still not you know still a limited product as far as what you can do with it yeah you know and so hydrocarbon is a lot more flexible in that regard because well it is a very small input batch size we're doing you know five hundred pounds or less per day in the average lab you know which is not massive scale we're not going to marry the right with that however I don't have any of that week-long post-processing that follows it up so while I might only get to process 500 pounds that day I could sell the oil that I made that day the next day yeah which is you know a big difference and it's something that you know we often skip when we look at our production plans is you know how many you know like we think about how much can this equipment do right you know per pound per hour whatever but we have to bring it all the way back and say okay well all of this equipment in a straight line is gonna take how long from raw material to package them for sale exactly and hydrocarbon is absolutely the fastest for that butane and propane evaporated very low temperatures which means we get the acid form which means I can go to Delta 9 I can distill it I can make it team right I can make edibles or I can make all of these other things that I can't do as easily or as quickly with co2 or ethanol yeah so that that post-processing flexibility is the primary advantage there it is however combustible yeah and so you know with ethanol we have the flammable issue and with co2 we have the high pressure issue with the liquid hydrocarbons we have both yeah so you know the risks are significant and the risks are only mitigated via equipment and safe workspace there's you know there's no safe way to just be careful you know and statistically speaking for everyone who is gonna listen to this and think well I've been doing it for years statistically speaking the more days you've gotten away with it the closer you are getting to the table when you want it will come and so you know the the safety risks are significant because it is combustible in nature however it is a clean extraction method butane and propane don't dissolve moles they can't carryover you know water is easily so the final product because there's it's you know very easy to remove the solvent and the solvents are food safe and our exposure to them is generally non-toxic they're very safe products whereas with ethanol high levels of residual ethanol can certainly be harmful especially for oral ingestion and you know that high level of water content and a lot of co2 products can lead to microbial yeah so we have you know some you know some pros and cons both on the processing side as well as for the actual consumer because if I need a product that can store for a very long time with limited degradation a hydrocarbon extraction product probably has a better shelf-life than an ethanol extracted product or a co2 extracted product based on literally just their moisture content yeah yeah no that's a excellent excellent summary and I think something that consumers take for granted is that things like microorganisms can grow on extracts in certain environments I've definitely seen it I mean working in the testing lab I'll never forget the first time I saw a what I mean it was essentially a moldy co2 extract I'd never come across that before but you know now I realized it's less common now that people have kind of learned more you know how to do their processes better but yeah that was something that was a shock to me and I'm sure as a shock to some people listening that haven't encountered that before and I'm glad you touched on the issue around the safety of the solvents because I was going to be something I was going to ask you is some people when they're first learning about extracts they feel put off by the higher crop the hydrocarbon extracts because they feel like there's a higher safety risk due to the solvent load in there so do you have any advice you could offer listeners that if they're worried about solvents and a product what sort of levels should they sort of be looking for what's typical and I mean ideally in a well purged extract you maybe wouldn't have anything detectable or very very low parts per billion but what are your thoughts on that if someone asked you like you know what's a safe exposure so the first thing that everyone should do is the first thing I mentioned in this interview go read the MSDS for the solvent that you're wondering about first of all because the health risks that are associated with it are gonna be on that sheet and it gives a range so that gives you the acute exposure range you know the like you know moderate you know or the persistent exposure and you want to see what your you know best and worst case scenarios are you know that acute exposure of you know 200 parts per million butane and your product is largely non-harmful just breathe fresh air you're fine right and that you know day to day exposure of over 5,000 parts per million for eight hours at a time or longer does lead to dizziness and you know some other issues and so you want to see the you know the best and the worst you want to see how much of this is it gonna take for you know nausea versus pass out versus stroke and seizure right you know like you want to know what the actual ranges are and that information is not a secret and it's not up for debate you know like for those solvents to exist and be used that information has been studied now it hasn't necessarily been studied for how hot of a DAB you're gonna take at home and how many grams you're gonna smoke per day you know these applications aren't necessarily standard but our human exposure from inhalation or ingestion has been studied for these solvents to actually be sold and be legally allowed for us to use an extraction license labs can't use solvents that haven't been tested in that way right um so you know so that data exists and I would encourage everyone to go read it right away because it's easy for us to all have opinions about the parts-per-million limit and a lot of those are based on state regulations which were formed ready opinions yeah of people yeah sometimes they're polite Iria yeah sometimes they're pulled from really weird places yeah right and so those numbers are not based on human studies those numbers are not based on you know known and proven and you know calculated potential harm they're just numbers you know they have you know about as much data behind them as the safe speed limit for a road you know like maybe 35 is safe in your car and maybe in my car 45 is safe and maybe with my mom driving my car 45 it isn't safe you know like maybe there's more variables than just that number so it's hard to rely on that because you're gonna see a really wide range and so the state of Massachusetts says ten parts per billion is what's safe for be obtained and you know the state of Oregon says five thousand parts per million right is the safe amount and you know who neither of them are in charge of how much is actually safe for you in your body and so the the numbers are a very difficult one to compare obviously we want to remove as much of those you know solvents as we possibly can however most of these solvents like butane propane co2 and ethanol are food safe products when we get into things like pentane and hexane and heptane um you know or some of the compounds that are being used for conversions like iodine or Tolley and like we've got we've got some more significant health risks and so and those actually are more common in like CVD products where there's no regulation scarier issue that we could get into later but you know for the most part you're going to have those solvents that are used listed on the label and so you can do a quick MSDS check and read what the best and worst could possibly be and then compare that to the parts per million and you know we can put math together and we can say you know 5,000 parts per million for eight hours a day of exposure to butane is what you know the MSDS recommends us being dangerous enough to actually make you ill and make you dizzy and so if you are smoking a product that has 5,000 parts per million in it don't smoke it for eight hours a day because you know like now we can start to at least say okay well that's something that you know a little a DAB at a time might add up to that acute exposure of right you know however many parts per million you know every time we flick our lighter that's about you know 5,000 parts per million briefly and so we're being exposed to butane and propane it's in your air you know co2 is in your air ethanol is in almost every flavored food prep right yeah you know it's like anything that has artificial colors probably contains ethanol you know so like a lot of these solvents exist it's not realistic to fear them and it is really important to judge them with math yeah you know like you've got to pay attention to how much is there there's a big difference between 20,000 parts per million of butane and you know 20 right and so you want to you want to pay attention to those numbers as best you can but I would also encourage anyone especially anyone who's smoking concentrates to listen to their body because the solvents themselves are known are studied and are tested for what we cannot provide to people right now is a comprehensive look at the potential conversions that are happening the byproducts of some of this exposure yeah just heating up a solution that's extremely you know high pH in ethanol that contains a lot of water could create some you know converted byproducts that become really dangerous yeah you know using iodine for conversions is you know of efficient to a certain extent but it creates a bond with cannabinoids that isn't tested for and now we have a cannabinoid compound that has been bonded with a little bit of iodine and that can get to your brain and that could probably end your life we don't know but that's not something that would be tested right and so the risks around these solvents you know are the greater concern and since we can't necessarily apply a lot of data to that right now listen to your body if it hurts to smoke stop it yeah yeah it's uncomfortable if it makes you feel weird don't keep doing it there are so many options out there that you should you know listen to you know the the cues that your own physical chemistry is giving you for the most part like our instincts are generally right and you know even terpenes you know can degrade to benzene yep so you know like the our favorite parts of cannabis could kill us yeah exactly so you've got a you know like be as educated as you can about the solvents you don't have to know everything about extraction but in the same way that you would look up a hormone that's added to your milk you look up a solvent that's used in your extraction and then just pay attention to what your body tells you yeah yeah I think that's a really good point you don't have to know everything but you should at least have the skill of knowing how to find the information when the time comes if you need to look that up yeah well shifting gears a little bit away from the safety side and talking about the products one thing I wanted to ask because it's something that I hear a question about a lot related to extraction what affects the various I guess we'll say consistencies of hydrocarbon based extracts because it's well known that there's a wide variety of sort of types of hydrocarbon extracts yeah and so can you speak a little bit to some of the dynamics that influence those final products yeah for sure so one of the reasons that hydrocarbon products have that you know wide range and texture and consistency see is because they have the potential to extract the acid form and for a lot of cannabinoids the acid form and the you know the decarboxylated form of that cannabinoid have different physical states so for example THC a is you know a solid colorless crystalline product at room temperature whereas you know Delta 9 THC is a you know a colorless liquid at room temperature and so that's a big difference in consistency so if my concentrate is mostly THC Delta 9 I'm gonna get sticky liquid cuz Delta 9 is a sticky liquid but if I've got mostly THC a I am going to have a primarily dry solid and so you know that first differentiation in ratio of you know TV versus THC a or you know CBD versus you know THC makes a big difference in you know just the potential consistency that I've got in front of me especially because I don't want to say decarboxylation can't be reversed but but generally we're not we're not going back from that so once we have crossed into that data box elated state you know once I've got CBD I've got a solid once I've got Delta nine I've got a liquid and so the hydrocarbon extraction process allows us to play with that texture a little bit more because we can start with a dry product and go liquid or not yeah so um so that already makes a big difference is just the dominant compound in any given solution is gonna dictate you know the structure that it takes on then from there we have you know the other minor groups that are involved now a hydrocarbon extraction is also excellent for terpene extraction because it happens at low temperature so we don't destroy them and they're soluble you know and butane of propane so we're able to capture a lot of them we also have the added benefit through hydrocarbon extraction of being able to extract wet or fresh frozen material because it doesn't take on water content in same way that 5,000 psi worth of co2 or any given amount of ethanol will so so we have you know the potential to not only extract more terpenes because they're compatible solvents but also because we can capture terpenes from the plant material before it has dried out before those have changed before those have evaporated and so that terpene content is mostly liquid sometimes our solid at room temperature but mostly we're dealing with liquids and so the amount of terpene content in any given hydrocarbon extracted product has a huge impact on that liquid versus solid situation because those terpenes could dissolve that's all or cannabinoid yeah yeah and so why we might have ninety percent you know solid THC a cannabinoid content we might still have something that looks half liquidy because those terpenes can actually dissolve quite a bit of it and keep it in solution so you know that that recipe gives us a lot of options and that's just based on what it contains regardless of what I might do to it if I just pour it out of my extractor and here it is then from there because we have that acid form because we have some of these solids we have the potential for crystallization or you know in the opposite route we have the potential for you know an emulsified or homogenized product and so you know shatter wax butter those kinds of things are generally homogenous products you know shatter is everything mixed up and you know solid and flat whereas the butter and the wax is everything whipped up and actually aerated but in either case basically the same original content which is way more THC a than that liquid terpene content which allows it to be you know dry rather than wet and then from there it's just you know how we play with it you know it's kind of that I mean it's kind of how do you take your eggs you know right like I'm screaming I'm sunny-side up you know so for me I always I'd try to pay attention to that chemical content first because it's a good indicator if I really care about flavor I probably don't want dry textured products right because inherently I'm gonna have less yeah yeah that makes perfect sense and how does the the material coming in affect some of that process one of the things that I was gonna ask you is you know what it's like working you mentioned fresh frozen so like the difference between like different types of like live resin and cured resin and you know these different attributes that relate to the flower material as it's coming in what are some of the big differences there there are so many important qualities for your extracted product I think one of the most obvious ones that a lot of people fail to pay attention to a surface-area look at big pretty buds that you know we're putting in a jar we're selling on a shelf we look at them like flowers yeah you know and we want them to have a nice clean cut and we want you know like we have these very aesthetic you know perceptions about what is good and what is bad and that is super irrelevant to me for extraction all I care about is resin content and big dense buds have less of it by weight than little fluffy buds that are next series Dennis because the surface area is greater by weight on those products and so you know the type of material that you want to provide for extraction isn't these big dense rock-solid nuggets those are annoying those take me time to break up and it's literally more plant material versus resin if I you know grind up a big dense bud homogenize it and get an analytical test on that I get totally different results than if I take the same amount of weight of small little fluffy buds grind it up and homogenize it they literally have more and that's all that matters to me for extraction however the you know where it grows on the plant certainly has an impact on the other chemical content ramp that it's going to contain you know especially terpene content that is produced generally to protect the plants from its local environment and so it would only stand to reason that the buds on top are in smell you know and respond differently than the ones on the bottom because they've got different jobs as far as that plant is concerned and they've got different enemies yeah yeah so you know so there's definitely a really important role that just the actual harvested nug plays you know not only in where it comes from on the plant but the surface area the density and even the time of harvest you know every single day that you push that harvest it produces different terpene content um it doesn't you know that turbine content doesn't store up the way that cannabinoid content does it wasn't accumulate and so if you harvest on a day when it isn't smelling amazing that's all I've got to work with yeah you know and if you harvest on a date when it smells outstanding and you freeze instantly I can get that I can get that back I can preserve it so you know the care that's taken during harvest is incredibly important for some of those volatile compounds and I you know I try to pay very close attention to that and you know the people that we want to work with are people who are also going to care about that it's difficult to get that kind of attention and care for your products if you're just you know massively harvesting everything on a 45 schedule regardless of what's happening in the room you know and so sometimes that kind of massive factory approach to it is not ideal for some of the boutique flavors however if we're just trying to extract cannabinoid content you know well we can get it from whatever you've got from you know there's still some other things to consider like literally the density of the cuticle you know how much wax content yeah yeah that trichome contains um you know if you've got really thick trichomes I'm probably gonna get lower yields your material not only because I it probably just contains less resin but also because the residents gonna be less accessible to me because removing waxes all right isn't a loose style that's the same process is removing cannabinoids and so it becomes more difficult to get a you know or therefore at least less cost-efficient to get a really clean yield and so you know some of that chemical content is you know really valuable and that's something that the people who work in like the rosin space are starting to pay a lot of attention to because high wax content is you know one of the highest risks associated with their products and it also contributes to their low yields and so if they can identify that you know wax content while they're growing it they could impact it they could change it they could improve on it and reduce it and actually grow plants that could produce five six percent you know yields on that rosin which would change their business model complete right entirely yeah you know so those things you know affect all of us not just rosin that's also something that's important for us with hydrocarbon extractive products and so that that quality is is really important um the other thing I think that would be important to pay attention to is transparency you know we we only know that it's free of the pesticides we test for her yeah we only know that it's free of the mycotoxins that we test for at the time that's on today yeah yeah you know like like a lot of that data is not quite complete and so we have to be able to trust who we work with and we all have to be open about that trust because sometimes we don't know that we're doing something wrong sometimes you know sometimes it is leaving their facility clean and getting moldy in my you know fridge like my freezer and fridge storage so like you know we all have to be able to be open with each other and work together to resolve those issues you know like it's it's really difficult to do a good job if you don't have someone who's willing to be transparent bring you into the garden and you know involve you in that you know harvest process so that you can both make clean and sustainable products yeah yeah no totally I remember when I was working in the testing labs how sad it was when you know a cultivator would end up with a testing result that they weren't expecting um you know or kind of like what you're mentioning like in a wholesale situation where the farmer sold it it was good when it went to the wholesaler it sat at the wholesalers facility for who knows how long they retested it and it comes back and then they're trying to hunt down what happened who's at fault and sometimes there's a lot of money involved and you know right you know some of these transactions and yeah sometimes it was devastating to see some of these farms that actually were putting in a lot of good energy trying to do things as best as possible and then somewhere you know along the chain things go wrong and they don't understand why and and sometimes couldn't figure it out you know what happens like somebody wouldn't fess up to some part of something and sometimes it's it's really you know things you you wouldn't necessarily expect one time I remember a guy had failed for pesticides and then realized that someone on his garden used a hose that was used on another farm you know that sure that sprayed pesticides and you just didn't keep track of you know that hose so yeah it's it's a it's a process that the industries you know learning all of these nuanced pieces of it you can understand the high level of like okay you know I'm not gonna use pesticides I'm not gonna do this at cetera no and then all these other factors come into play that you don't imagine right and it's and it's easy to villainize you know who's at fault right and say you know like any failure is unacceptable you know but but who's at fault is not as important as how to remediate exactly you know like like what's most important is figuring out happen and why so that it can't happen again not so that we can dissolve our relationship and you know say bad things about each other on the Internet like the point is to move forward we have all failed before you know we have all done a bad job somewhere you know just because you've never failed a pesticide test doesn't mean you couldn't fail any pesticide price you've just never failed the tests you've taken you know and you know there's just so many ways that things can go wrong that you know we have to find people to work with that have the same you know ethics and morals and intentions as we do so that we can work through them together you know like bad business deals are what sync otherwise you know strong well intended businesses and a lot of that comes from this very you know like all in or all out kind of attitude that we tend to have rather than working through it together to improve you know these relationships should be long-term yeah and you know just because the industry is new doesn't mean we can't come at it with that kind of diplomacy and you know with a structure that allows us to you know prepare for things going wrong right it does yeah we're human like mistakes are gonna happen like despite anyone's best effort things are gonna go wrong and you're right it's how you respond to that and how you move forward that really is is most critical and in general what most of us want to see is for the industry as a whole to learn and figure out its problem areas and then address those teach you know as many people as we can to spread that knowledge and then see the industry get you know better and better its to see quality improve and safety improve and and absolutely everybody you know yeah mature along this industry together so but yeah there's there's a lot of like I don't know it's it's weird coming into the cannabis industry seeing some of the like drama that goes on among the companies and and the people and so much you know egos fighting egos that it's it's weird it's like middle school again sometimes yeah well gets the thing is that everyone makes it so personal yeah but like it took many persons yeah you know to accomplish that even if it was one guy who used an old hose in this garden you know like that choice affected everyone and so that means that everyone was responsible for making sure that there wasn't old hoses right exactly you know like like yeah he's the guy who used it but there was probably two or three other humans who could have helped prevent it all right you know and there was probably a few people down the line who could have done something about it you know like there's ways to work through it and you know pointing the finger at who's at fault is just it's like our you know our first petty instinct yeah but it doesn't serve anyone you know and that and that goes you know for even even small issues like you know getting low yields I would rather go back to a farmer and say you know my yields are poor from this material um you know like let's work on a way to improve this not say I'm not gonna pay you this much for this material and I'll never do business with you again you know which is right which is how most people would respond as they would get you know they would get upset they would blame someone they would say you're just bad at this you know and they expect perfection it's so much easier to work together and you know take someone who gives you low yields into giving you even higher yields than you get from your high-yield suppliers you know at the same price you started with you know long-term relationships keep us all in business and I think they're the only things that will protect us from large financial interests not easing us later because they will have to do it all themselves if we don't work together which we're not going to compete yeah now I think that is absolutely the case and you know it's cool to see organizations like you know from the future 4200 forum the good life gang you know to see these companies that are sharing SOPs and you know information and trying to create that robust Network you know that'll hopefully be able to to survive its that's been really cool to see and even you know on the farm side too or seeing more and more kind of farms that are trying to find ways to work together and kind of co-op situations figure out how to not necessarily have to fall into that trap of like large monoculture you know big AG scale cultivating keep doing things the way they want in a more sustainable way but work together to provide enough material that you know these accounts that want to buy massive amounts at once they'll still have their you know their weight their but I wanted to check in with you for just a minute so we've been going for almost an hour how are you on time yeah ok excellent well the next question I wanted to ask you is related to a hash tag that you make a lot about your classes that I'm just probably ignorant and don't know what it means so I want to ask you I was talking to you Aquatech what does that do um so Aquatech is kind of a marketing term and basically it refers to the methodology that we developed which is a chromatography application using you know butane and propane right in the column and so the idea was to perform that you know chromatography separation in the original extraction solvent although you can apply this to crude oil that's been extracted from almost anything else it just poses different issues all which are fun challenges to work through right exactly yep but yes so the idea there is that using chromatography we are able to have our liquid phase our solution moving through a solid phase of media and that media is going to separate our solution by polarity which allows us to extract our terpenes very quickly very thinly get them out of the extractor and away from heat right away and then we get to pull out pull apart the rest of our solution and so depending on the column that you build and the media that you use and the parameters that you put in place you know we're modeling this after flash chromatography yeah I suppose but it allows us to to separate you know kind of by category first terpenes cannabinoids waxes and you know water soluble so we're able to get extreme high purity crystallization results almost instantly because we've reduced our solution down to simpler parts yeah which is exciting from you know an efficiency perspective and doesn't mean even less post-processing right exactly you know which you know crystallization is already nothing you know that's an easy post process for most people and you know even in the pharmaceutical world like it's that's something that we've you know got down but this is just a fantastic shortcut you're 99% right out of the extractor you know almost every time yeah but then it also does allow us to pull that terpene content out separately so it's not interfering with crystallization and also not exposed to some of the same temperatures and conditions that we would potentially expose our cannabinoids to so that allows you to remove the butane and propane at different temperatures you know and under different conditions then it takes for me to remove butane and propane from you know that crystal indirect product so now I get to treat each of these compounds appropriately yeah and bring them back together later yeah anything that's Aquatech is a formulated product it didn't come out of the extractor that way it came out of the extractor in multiple fractions and we pulled the best parts out of it which are subjective I decided what I like to ask for the most part um you know it's also based on analytical testing and you know where the clean parts of our product are but in that way we're able to pull a flavonoid content we're able to pull terpene content we're able to get high purity cannabinoid content and then we can deliver it back to the consumer inconsistent ratios yep so you know like one your question earlier like explain these different textures a lot of times those textures are based on what came out of the extractor so if I didn't get a lot of terpenes but I got a lot of cannabinoids here you go I've got a whole bunch of dry wax or I've got really stable shatter and if I do get a lot of terpenes and I still have a decent amount of cannabinoids now I've got wet sugar now I've got Creasy batter now I have you know shatter that won't stabilize you know but I'm taking it from the entire other approach which is get everything out of the plant pull it into my different jars now I have ingredient a formula make whatever I want yep so I can make stable shadow from there I can reduce all my THCA content back into butane and propane and pour it out as a slab or I can whip it up together with some terpenes or I can crystallize it into diamonds I could do I could do carve it and you know now I can have delta-9 and THC you know like I can make whatever I want every single time and I can still preserve the live resin profile that the plant gave me but I can make whatever I want every single time which is an enormous value because yeah sometimes you don't get the ratios of things and that you're looking for right it's really common to have more THC a content then pairs nicely with terpene content and so it's great to not just have to dilute the flavor yeah yeah you know I can just pull that THC a aside put that into Delta 9 and how you put it in carts I can do whatever I want with it and you know maintain that profile of the plant with a consistent camera noid content which especially for medical patients is important because they you know are only just now starting to figure out why sativa or indica is too broad of a you know category and so we start telling them to pay attention to these terpenes but they do also still have to pay attention to the dose the cannabinoid dose matters yeah and so if I can provide the same cannabinoid content every time but different flavors yep I I can't say that it's good for anything I'm not allowed to make any health claims right um but if I'm consistent then you can figure out what works for you exactly you know you can take a bigger or smaller dab or you could tell me that that ratio is not cool and I can literally change it right yeah whatever I want well that's that's really exciting because I mean you're talking about making standardized product which is so needed in the industry and when I'm you know doing seminars or teaching folks I always talk about journaling as far as you know when people talk about what what work for this or that the other like the only way you're gonna figure that out is by paying attention to how your body reacts to different things and journaling is a great way and one of the limitations that you know people are running into with journaling is the inconsistent product formulations you know if they prefer extracts they will usually hone in on maybe just the THC or CBD values and maybe won't focus too much on other things or they are paying attention to terpenes and anything else that can get data on but batch to batch is just you know changing right so that's that's really exciting because that it fixes a variable and a lot of people they got like 300 variables per batch right yeah just one fewer you know and and anecdotal data or journaling is still data you know like all all we needed to understand it is more data it is a lot more data but it's attainable and so even if you know if every person who smoked wrote down how made them feel and we fed that to a computer the algorithm would be accurate yeah you know like it would tell us what it does right um you know so we wherever that data comes from it's extremely valuable and especially for the people who need it most write it down you know I mean I can't be expected to remember what temperature I did something at during my extraction I write it down yep you cannot be expected to remember how your headache how fast your headache your high at the time you know like John these are things that you know we really benefit from if people can write it down and more data is available than ever before I you know we go a step above and put terpene content on every single package that we sell so every single terpene is listed along with the well I shouldn't say every single every single right we can test for exactly as well as the ratio and then all of that's available on our website too so even if you just write down you know I tried this Cushman's batch this one time you can back in time look on her website and figure out you know like that Cushman's had a lot of CVG yes yeah in addition to having a lot of Pioneer phenylene whatever you know like you can start to pull all of the pieces of data together and the more data I get the more data I'll put out but I don't have the ability to predict what its gonna do for anyone I can't say that it's good or bad I'm relying on the plant itself being ideally safe and it's giving me you know a profile of chemical content that is beneficial and the only way I'll know is after people provide feedback on that and so you know I I believe strongly my method because it allows me to make changes you know and I'm not just stuck with whatever has happened inside of my extraction system you know that I can I can make it work for people which is really exciting yeah I mean I love sweet flavors and good dabs I love that it's available recreationally but the medical products that we produce are you know generally a disservice to the people who need them most and so yeah I you know I hope that through this method we're able to make you know the right chemical profiles super cheap for people you know I think it sucks that you know it's easier for people to get high THC products at a low price but not to - one CBD THC products at a low price you know um you know like I I would love to figure out what those ratios are and make those medical products available through our current system rather than forcing the pharmaceutical industry to take on that role yeah yeah I agree and and the the overall just cost of cannabis products generally for medical patient side I'd like to see some states try to fix that problem it's something that and a lot of the doctors I've interviewed they bring that issue up that when I asked them about dosage a lot of times interview I did very recently with the pain physician in North Carolina that's working with patients using CBD was like well you know our patient the ones that are you know really in severe chronic pain a lot of times they're either poor or they're elderly they don't have a ton of money to spend on you know yeah now all the trial and error first of all exactly on just the regular cost of these products yeah exactly and socially they can afford to try it once and if they don't get the results they're looking for iterative up on it exactly yeah yeah that's something that's that's been on my mind is how many people have given up quickly especially so now we can loop back around and talk about the CBD industry cuz that's where right now I see this like really highlighted with so many people flocking to buy CBD products and they're all over the board as far as quality and potency and pricing with some of them extremely expensive and you've got these people trying to treat very severe medical conditions that are spending 150 $200 on a one ounce bottle of a CBD tincture that may have like 300 or 500 milligrams in the whole bottle it's it's really fascinating and I did want to actually come back around you mentioned some of your thoughts about quality issues related to the CBD industry and the extractions kind of CBD so do you mind talking about that what is unique about what's going on in the CBD industry and what has you a little concern yeah world is extremely unique and it's very strange because in you know in the traditional you know medical marijuana or recreational markets it's all you know these are all state programs that's right so of course they vary because the states vary a lot of these states have Home Rule which means that not only the state rules are in effect but also every municipality yeah do whatever they want and so you see in that license structure a huge range of requirements from the safety and architecture of the building all the way out to you know the solvents that are allowed to be used and you know what is required to be tested for and what isn't you know so view the regulations are all over the place within that framework in the CVV world it's it's kind of this like extreme polar opposite land you know we have you know some actual federal regulations in place we have truly GMP USDA you know certified facilities that are manufacturing pharmaceutically pure compounds start to finish and then you have literally anyone anywhere in the world making a bath bomb in their living room and selling it as medicine you know to whoever will buy it you know like there's so that you know that spectrum is absolutely insane because there's not enforcement on anyone except the people who are doing perfect things yeah and the people who are doing the perfect pharmaceutical appear compounds you know those are all going to formulations and you know a lot of times there's like white labeling or they're selling product and so you know it doesn't mean that small businesses aren't you know having access to that level of purity necessarily but there's just no chain of custody monitoring whatsoever and so you know it's really it's a really scary place to be I've gotten about a dozen messages today already because we have our first potential confirmed CVD I saw that about that so we have no doubt about that I don't even want to make any you know comments cuz I haven't been able to read enough about what was being referenced in there but but it's not surprising at all that drug interactions right would be our first you know actual cannabinoid induce death because drug interactions are known and when we break it down it's all just chemicals um so you know this one company that made this one product is going to burn alive probably yeah yeah over this issue but likes everyone but it affects everyone and it doesn't mean that they're the only ones who are you know creating a product that could cause this you know much like the vape you know crisis of 2009 like even now we still don't know yeah the vitamin e acetate caused the death exactly we just know that it was in all of their lungs and not even all of them just most you know like we we still don't have yeah explanation common factor has still not wrapped and identified right so we get more data and more data and more data but we still don't have a complete picture you know we're still missing huge pieces in our puzzle we just have to keep working forward on it and so the CVD world is in a unique position to innovate faster because they don't have the same regulations that we do they also are in a position to infiltrate the public domain faster and influence the public's opinion of how cannabinoids are bought and sold yeah which is exciting in a lot of ways I you know people make fun of gas station CVD but I think that if we're gonna sell cigarettes at a gas station I'm gonna say liquor at a gas station if we're gonna sell sugar and caption a gas station sure we should be able to sell weed at a gas station why not all cannabinoids should be able to be sold at a gas station if one of them can so I appreciate you know the way that some of that underground CBD pushes the boundaries yeah you know in those you know very honestly political ways um you know because it does you know give give me hope about a future where I can still make a craft concentrate that people can buy it was the other end of that spectrum where they're making 99.999% pure compounds and formulating them back into you know a gel cap or whatever his way is boring that's not what I you know like it's very it's very cool to build and then I don't want that factory job I want to keep innovating new things so you know that pharmaceutical world should exist but but I've want to see both and you know the things that happen in between those two that are dangerous jeopardize all of it yeah yeah exactly really unfortunate because only those big ones have the potential to survive that FDA world but if we don't have the market to support them then they I'll go out of business and we're watching that happen this year in the hemp industry we're seeing some of the biggest players who had the most money yeah and the biggest extractors and just millions of dollars in infrastructure right now that aren't gonna you know they have probably won't even plant yep and so that's that isn't encouraging for our industry I don't want to see the money fall out yeah it's been wild the past year seeing how many big names are folding or going under a change of ownership trying to totally restructure to stay alive it's been really really bizarre and yeah the that CBD death I just saw that several hours ago there were some time this morning you know it's it's one of those things that we those of us that have kind of studied cannabinoids and and particularly CBD for a while we've all known that like yeah the grapefruit effect you know is a thing with CBD and you know CBD seems to exhibit you know a higher potency then even grapefruit does and having that effect and it's it's one of those things that you know the market seems to be too far ahead of where you know like the medical establishment is there like a lot of doctors don't know that and a lot of nurses don't know that and I feel like if they did they would probably inquire more about whether patients are using CBD you know when they're on other drugs that sort of thing and it's it's one of these risks that could be mitigated with education and proper involvement between you know the patient and doctor relationship and that sort of thing but it's also one of these things like you're alluding to that you know something wrong can happen and it's going to affect the entire industry in major ways if you know people start dying from drug interactions from CBD and then you have new regulations that come in that affect how cannabinoids can exist on the marketplace or you know and then that's going to affect all of these other companies all over a risk that could be mitigated you know just with proper education and oversight and recognition of something zone risks and limitations I feel like the the cannabis industry and particularly with CBD right now it's an interesting place because people really don't like talking about risk at all like they don't want to acknowledge that cannabis has any negative you know potential and it's something that as an industry we've really got to get over because it's gonna keep causing problems and it makes the industry look bad if you can't acknowledge you know the relatively few you know risks that actually exist with cannabis compared to a lot of other natural products right like safe is a spectrum yeah you know and poison is in the dough exactly and so we can't pretend that cannabis is the exception to you know like the most common fundamental rule of what we put in our bodies you know like it matters how much and it matters what yeah you know and I I don't like obviously I don't like to see anyone die from you know anything preventable let alone from cannabis but I don't like to you know to open ourselves up to you know demonizing you know the you know the word cannabis represents 400 different potential active ingredients and you can't you know we can't say oh well now CBD is bad you know Auroville now just CBD t-shirts is bad or just CVD over 200 milligrams a day you know like we just we can't generalize it you know but we can specialize we can say these drug interaction issues were known and you know all you have to do is you know talk to your doctor or at least research you know the drugs that you're using you know if more people like you said just knew the grapefruit like it's a such a simple thing to communicate that says if your drug says that you cannot consume grapefruit and citrus you should avoid cannabinoids well you know like proliferating that is something that would be extremely important information for all of the prescribing doctors who write medical recommendations because now that there's a large portion of them that aren't you know keeping up on that data not to mention every single budtender because they're not medical professionals but every single one of us making recommendations every single day about dos yeah and and we don't we don't have any good data to support what is safe and what isn't um so I you know I hope that this brings the bright attention mm-hmm to those issues you know because it's easier to abuse a product that's more readily accessible right but we really need to address what that abuse looks like before it just all gets taken away yeah yeah yeah it relates to another idea that came up in one of my really early interviews about like what does responsible cannabis use look like and trying to like have that discussion and like you know being able to have like an elevator pitch kind of response to that like what does that look like especially as you know legalization progresses and people you know are able to have more open honest conversations with adolescents and young kids and stuff about you know cannabis like yeah how do how do we talk about the risks in a mature honest way how do we talk about responsible use in a mature honest way and you know and going back to this theme that keeps coming up of you know being able to just make the industry better increase you know support public health and safety and just overall as a society just be better and handle these things in a more mindful way yeah yeah it's it's something I think about constantly because I have you know a two-year-old now yeah have a one-year-old yeah so it's something I think about a lot because you know my parents never consumed any cannabis in their lives Newsday and so it was easy for them to say abstain mm-hmm you know like you know like even if they were wrong about saying it was unsafe you know like they were in a position to just you know not use whereas you know I'm going to be in a completely different position when I talked to my son because I'm gonna I'm gonna have to justify my use yeah um you know at a minimum let alone you know be able to justify my recommendations on his and I have no idea what that's gonna be yeah cuz I don't even know like by the time he gets exposed to cannabis we might not even be smoking flour anymore right yeah I know I might just like download it into our like air pod you know like I have no idea what cannabis consumption is gonna look like 10 years from now or 20 years from now because I never would have predicted my life today you know in 2009 when I you know walked into a dispensary for the first yeah you know like like I was still impressed by you know giant volcano vaporizer yeah the world is different yeah so you know how how I communicate that is something I think about a lot because I educate adults and that comes with the social contract of I'm not responsible for you I'm gonna tell you what I know and you're going to interpret it and apply it to your own life but I'm not responsible for your choices but I am responsible for my son's Travis you know and I am responsible for you know the way he makes those decisions and so I really I hope that education is something that you know we can follow you know really hard you know like it was great to get rid of a lot of the dare you know scare tactic type of you know fear-mongering but we can't just leave it at that yeah you know we have to replace it with something valuable if it turns out that you know all of these jewels are more dangerous than cigarettes you know then like telling kids not to smoke cigarettes and not being right prepared to respond to the vaporizer situation you know was an epic failure and so you know we're in that same position with cannabis you know like edibles are crazy today and I do not think kids should be going around eating dispensary edibles yeah oh they'll you know I think that they don't have a good understanding of what that dose looks like whereas I at least did have you know the social knowledge of knowing the difference between drinking a whole bottle of beer versus a whole bottle of tequila you know at 14 or at 16 or whatever but with cannabis we don't we don't communicate that very well and we might put the milligrams on the package but that doesn't mean any right anyone you have no context in is 200 milligrams per dose so yeah 200 milligrams of THC right why not like we don't have any perspective that we provide to consumers let alone the unintended potential consumers so I you know I really hope that the cannabis industry will uphold you know it's its original vows to take care of medical patients through that education the more we learn about cannabis the better those recommendations can be and you know we can explain these risks and hopefully prevent them you know yeah in the future does Colorado have potency limits on edibles um so there's limits per package it's 100 milligrams per package and the recommended dose is 10 milligrams per piece so whatever your edible product is it has to be easily identified as what 10 milligrams would represent so that either means like 10 pieces yes I meant it or whatever you have to be able to break it up or not just on the drink that tell you how far to drink it down you know something that makes it easy I guess I got to figure out how much you've consumed at once yeah that's interesting too because even 10 milligrams to like someone that is new to cannabis edibles or cannabis in general I know people that great have consumed 5 milligrams and had started to have overwhelming experiences yeah so that that context that you're talking about is so important and yeah edibles in general it's so hard to get I don't know predictable effects from depending on oh yeah what you're eating and how they're made what the dose is and like super metabolism exactly what you've eaten during that day and how that's gonna affect it and you know it's something like a drink it I had some friends that were working in testing labs that were working on trying to understand issues specifically related to drinks but one of the things I saw recently is that the liner inside of aluminum cans and things actually or our lipophilic and cannabinoids will gather into them over time so the potency of the drink will change over time right and will lower which is fascinating and then I know there's another issue with drinks that you know depending on the pH they're seeing some interesting conversions and some of the like THC infused sodas so just adds another layer of complexity to the the edible market right that uh I don't know I really like the idea of these formulated extracts standardized it also makes me wonder if you know having a product like that that you could standardize and that you could define chemically that you could say this has you know this much of sort of the terpene class and of that class there are these variations and you know this percent concentration of cannabinoid class and these variations that you know then researchers might be able to take something like that in the future and actually be able to start to do some more interesting research with products that are more akin to what people are actually using in the you know in the actual market and understand how people react and because that's several clinicians that I've spoken with have mentioned it's like that's one of the big drawbacks of them wanting to push forward on some interesting clinical trial work is there's like you know where's the standardized product yeah yeah and that's that's one thing that's always been really difficult for me is it like I want to make good products I want to sell safe medicine you know I want to feel good about everything that I'm making but but we're just relying on the planet to give us those camera yeah yeah we're just relying on its a carapace being great and that being good enough and that isn't good enough for literally any other type of extraction that isn't good enough for any other type of product like you always have to you know consider all of those factors and and so you know when we're trying to sell something that has dozens of active ingredients in a final product at concentrated doses you know compared to what they were originally delivered in if you were to just consume raw flour I'd you know I feel like there's a lot of responsibility there that I don't even have the data to back up you know like I can't say that more pining is better right we're worse yeah we're safe I can say I like it yeah right but that doesn't help anyone else and that doesn't you know that doesn't give me you know a standard to work from necessarily which is what we need if we want to you know improve that data and so you know one thing I'm really excited about is being able to now track through different harvests and even just age of material how that profile changes because if I'm extracting it the same way yeah and I'm starting to see variations from the same app deucer now we can actually take that data back even further and say what did you do want these plans right you didn't do want those plants you know like now we can like it I can do a better job extracting in lab that's great but I could I could influence the decisions that help them make be a better grower yeah you know like I'm expected to you know test my product at every step in my process to make sure it's getting pure but do the growers go and test their bud every single week to see what its growing to see if that terpene profile is developing to see if it's all limiting or if it's gonna get better you know like we we don't hold them to the same analytical standards but we could yeah yeah absolutely yeah and that would make it easier for me so that the great but I you know it would make it better for the consumer because they could be more consistent if they knew the impact the you know their behaviors had chemically on what I'm able to extract yeah I mean ultimately creates like a win-win-win situation cuz the farmer would just get better it would help you with your process to be able to make standardized materials more easily more efficiently and the consumer would be you know sort of have this itch scratch that's been there for so long I've just like I just want to be able to get the same thing you know every time I go yeah and we can that's the only thing I can't give you yeah right unless you want just eh right yeah yeah you know I can't I can't make it the same yeah so that that feedback is invaluable both from the consumer and to the garden yeah yeah totally well to start to wrap things up here I wanted to there's like two sort of broad questions that I'll ask you one is what are some of the most prevalent misconceptions about either cannabis or cannabis extraction or extracts themselves that you encounter most frequently I mean I think you brought up the the solvent scare Oh baby which is probably one of the most common ones is that people look at solvent extracted concentrates as being dangerous and I would agree that most of them are dangerous to do you know the the operation definitely requires scale equipment and you know safety protocols to keep everyone safe but generally they're safe to consume however I think that the exact opposite is also true you know one of the greatest misconceptions is that cannabis is inherently safe and I would argue that cannabis is only as safe as the people who are growing and manufacturing it you know cannabis is not a wild product anymore it's not mother nature yeah and it doesn't love us you know like it it is a plant that's being grown mostly for profit by people and people you know you got to choose who you trust and so you know cannabis is only safe as the people who produced it and the absolute same is true with concentrates they are only as safe as the manufacturer who you know who processed them and packaged them and delivered them to you and from there they're only as safe as the person who's storing and consuming them yeah and so you know the the misconception that cannabis is ultimately safe is I think potentially a dangerous one we really want to pay attention to what we're doing with this plant because we keep doing new and exciting it up and we keep discovering new things and it's not uncommon in science in general for us to be wrong all right and yeah you know there are parts of cannabis that can be very dangerous and there are parts of cannabis concentrates that can be very dangerous and you know I think that those you know it's not something that we should be afraid of but it's something that we should absolutely be educated about and no one's gonna look for that education if we all operate under the impression that it is linked it's safe yeah you know fire is safe if you don't tell right right exactly you know we have to you know consider those you know benefits and risks at all times yeah well it's definitely been refreshing talking to you and hearing the balanced way you know that you approach all of this being willing to acknowledge the downsides and risks as well as the you know the awesome potential and and upsides and and just being very real about you know acknowledging all of that and I really enjoy hearing your perspective of you know that ultimately it's better for all of us if we can talk through these things talk through our conflicts try to work forward and and ultimately you know all be the better for it so it's yeah thanks for being willing to come on and share that perspective and and all the great information that you've shared in the past we've gone for almost an hour and a half so I really appreciate it of course thank you for having me always enjoy you know talking about cannabis and it concentrates um and you know especially that in a way that'll educate some other people and hopefully yeah I think this will be a start some conversations

Clementine over here this one's a raspberry light key and then this one's death by cookies which is Death Star and cookies which is a weird combination I love the jars yeah they actually hate them no the opaque part is a requirement for regulations and so yeah and so the way the companies make the jars opaque is they just paint a clear jar so inside the jar you can see the imperfections of the paint job on the outside of the jar so it looks like there's black [ __ ] in my hash because it's like a wrinkle in the paint behind the jar you know and so it's maddening to package and you can't tell if they're like is a thing in your hash or not and then people take a picture yeah so that is delicious so the paint part is a typical but yeah so super-clean so you know are you just doing it yourself are you in with the company yeah so I have a couple of things going on but I started a partner with Santo Gardens which is not a garden at all mostly because I got involved and so I turn to

interesting year to decide to become a medical dispensary in Denver CO or a medical myth in Denver Colorado because the market is crazy saturated with a lot of competitive low pricing you know low quality on the inputs like it's you know all of the premier brands are running the exact same material so it's really hard to have a like angle over anyone else and what I needed was a place to try out my experiments on higher quality material because I'd just been consulting for the previous 5 years and under the pretense of consulting people bring you in because things are not going well because the material is poor because the equipment is non performing they don't call you and they're like so things are going really well our material is extremely high-quality and we're just wondering what we can do to get better like that's never the higher yeah so I needed a place to test some ideas and Santo Gardens allowed me to come in the lab and try out some weird stuff with their freshmen so that's where I'm getting to this so what it's often referred to as color remediation I don't like that name because color is in a compound and some things that are colored aren't contaminants and some things are so it's a bad way to describe it but it's the you know the nomenclature of the day and the idea there's we're using polar adsorbents to remove polar compounds within our extraction process and so with a hydrocarbon as their solvent it's extremely nonpolar most of our target compounds like terpenes and cannabinoids are nonpolar and so those adsorbents disallow the things that we don't want like moisture things that are soluble in moisture heavy metals pesticides salts sugars stuff that we don't want in our final product and it allows everything else through we don't know exactly what the perfect ratio of like the ideal you know hash oil really is but it you know when you compare like the high-end solvent list to the high-end solvent made we have the same compounds we're gonna see almost the same thca ratios in your high-end versus mine we're gonna see really high terpene ratios in your high-end versus mine because it turns out that if you do a really good job extracting you get the but but like but to be fair I mean Mary told me my first Lite hydrocarbon right so much respecting the IDS on fire by the way it's very following and like yeah it's a it's a yeah so I'm I'm partial to like hydrocarbon extractions and it is because the product it's the best extraction methodology and of course people out there would argue about crying ethanol and co2 and even refining to distil it but yeah good you know my hydrocarbon processes do you get you all the trip you get you all that you need right that what you're looking at what know or what's in the trichome head is another way to put it like those materials are the ones you want the other ones need to be filtered out coming through exactly ya know it's so yeah it's just this is a client this is like yeah definitely a lot very happy just like I mean like I've been growing for a while my first step into like the legit campus world it's like you know I like transporting myself to Denver started building that map and like it was just awesome I was like first I don't use type things and like first but like going to a place like that facility to buy and get checked out on cannabis extraction equipment doubtfully a first you know so super excited and like now getting you know games definitely leveled up like none of these kinds of products were being discussed back then people just weren't at that level we were just happy for shadow you know we're happy to have no residual solvents right and and for a really long time and even still now like what people were always chasing with concentrates was like consistencies and colors and so like the idea of color remediation I feel like is remediating or our attitude towards color more than remediating the product of color cuz when I make these none of these are clear when I make them I have absolutely clear th CA and then I have slightly colored phenols I have you know like there are compounds of colors that are in my you know super Nate and my mother liquor or whatever that other solution you know whatever you want to call it and it just happens to still look really clear when I you know bring it out by the gram but like I'm not removing color so much it's just bring you know using every resource I have to make it a little bit better than before and so like back when we met that's what getting a closed loop was like that was still you taking advantage of every opportunity that you could and all the technology that was available to make the best thing that you could and at the time probably the best advice I had was like use propane that's more selective but like we get yeah we get better because we learn more and that's not gonna stop so you know TBD till next year this is really exciting because people are finally is starting to embrace some of this change and that's something that's been really hard to do for a long time because the market was so competitive everything sold there was no reason to get better cuz if you could just get shatter you could get money in Colorado I mean the whole dab market was there before anywhere else an appreciation for extracted products and you're basically saying that like I mean it's good to be the one who can say and we decided our competitive advantage would be best quality yeah exact are competitive in is where the cheapest or we're the fastest melody buzz yeah yeah yeah else has thought of that ya know in our industry is now's the time for like the top shelf right I do it's it's fair point lake in the beginning not so much here in California but definitely in Denver it's like safe access was like such a boom you didn't have you just had to put out product like just put out product people would buy it was like I felt like especially without coming that we were selling into a void I didn't have to try to innovate or try to raise the game and now yeah and look look even this device the peak it's like normalizing yeah we couldn't articulate it the consumer had no palate like so even if you think the alcohol model when we come out of prohibition most people are still used to drinking soda and milk they have no refined palate for spirits or wine or beer and that impacts America for a while you know we they had mixed drinks it could be a sweet thing mixed with alcohol but refined spirits good wine take a while to get that palate back in cannabis there's a few of us that may have had it earlier on and didn't even have access to high-end stuff we're just happy for good flowers and whatnot or extractions you might make it home but now people are catching up quick right into market in Colorado California you're both seeing a slow like finally sure sure I think every day of dispensaries there's a higher demand for quality and because we can talk about it let's just start there the fact that like you know brand ambassadors can go out and articulate the value proposition and the differentiation of what you make your products and how you make them and like science education like it takes TLC to innovate right and usually people like myself like we talked about and get passionate about how we make our products because we're thinking and putting like energy into it and like I think consumers resonate with that they're like all that those dudes are doing it real like there that's good stuff and then like and then they taste and everybody's palate is different and and look I'm really psyched on concentrates because this could like these kinds of devices in this kind of session could mitigate like the vape pen craze that's going on and while I appreciate the convenience the pennants like I don't walk little flash right you know right that's right there's a little bit of ritual to it and like while I appreciate the convenience of a pen beyond just losing them all the time I don't know that that device will ever be ready for primetime and most of these are solids those pens are not really for that I know the heated chamber but they're also if they're done right they're potent enough to be curated right like stop we just walked in here have a session and move on you know and go for quality not everybody's gonna think that way there are people that walk around with six packs of paps you know and there's gonna be concentrates and pens for those people but yeah the game is leveling up every year like next year I mean the peak wasn't around last year right next year it'll be something else it'll be another dealer great device or some new innovation in technology you know obviously saucing diamonds all those things you know that have been coming out lately are amazing yeah so it's a talked about and so two markets the farmers you're working with the dynamics between like what cultivars are we smoking and then like are you telling them what you want or are they being like I have some hot news ship that you guys definitely need to check out I mean the market difference is probably huge then between us cuz you know one thing that I always like to point out is that Colorado is famous for good concentrates and bad weed so we're doing our very best out there yeah I mean that's probably a product of like we have a lot more Sun grown and there's a lot more farmers and so yeah we do get good quality weed and people nerd out on flowers concentrates definitely of course have had a rise here our relationship like you know this is not it's all sorts from Sun grown and it all goes back to to the farmer right so we are trying to go for just as a value proposition of farm-to-table handcrafted product you know so yeah it's just no one can poke any holes and yeah it's hard again iodine look I'll be honest and we would not be able to effectuate the strategy had we not had an already in another grand identity like our core brand identity with our topicals and our wellness suite we call that the tip of the spear it's allowed us to grow that marketplace and dispensary get revenue and now take our time I mean this is definitely a quality over margin product it's hard to scale it takes there's a labor to create these high-end concentrates put them at a price point that only so many people are buying we're growing that marketplace without here talking I try to dab as many people out so that they can understand them what it is to have great low-temperature vaporization and whatnot and I love smoking flower don't get me wrong but when it comes it's like flower because that's awesome and the tradition and then after that I'm all low temp favored ization it's like you can harness everything all the flavors and yumminess that you need that way you know definitely so talk so you're starting to talk about some of the farms and like what what are you both asking them what are they both asking do you actually sorts me indoor so yeah so everything that we source is indoor and we only process fresh frozen our facility which is also a little bit more specific because yes yes same thing but there's a lot of resistance to that from a lot of farmers like it's hard to get really high quality fresh frozen on a consistent basis yeah so it's a limited market you know for example with the medical license all of those pounds and plants are literally still associated to individual humans and that you know that market is shrinking and so then it becomes harder to provide enough cannabis for everyone let alone enough cannabis for me to process and turn into high quality concentrates and so you know the amount of low quality material that's available definitely is excessive compared to the amount of you know high quality material which makes it you know restrictive marketplace we also only purchase wholesale and sell wholesale compared to where you're going you know and working directly with a farm and right back we handpick regardless of who our supplier is some suppliers we purchase only specific things from them and we you know choose the best of what they're growing in our opinion or the stuff that's best for us for our extraction because the way that you want to grow cannabis and the types of cannabis that are best for extraction are not always the best for big fat colas and you know nice easy to sell high-end pounds and so and especially with like solvent list as your application that matters even more because your yield is so much less accessible when it's difficult compared to my solvent you can you know dissolve it easily and so it's not even just the the quality of the material that we have to go after but the like the type of material itself because anything that's too dense anything that is you know those big giant like football colas um you know is really not the best product for us we're looking for surface area in addition you know to having the you know the incredible potency and the perfect print you know turbulent flavor but it's definitely same for us like you know we send a truck out to the farm we have to we test wash every strain where now that we're in our second year we're second set of cycles we do have certain crops like the GMO being grown consistently by the same farmer but it's intimate relationship because with this solvent list it's about trichome head size so not everything is gonna wash well just straight up and there's nothing we can do about that so we need to find the strains that wash well right now is by eye even though there's a proposed technology we're trying to develop where we can take snapshots of the trichomes and get a measurement and understand scientifically the average trichrome heads on this particular strain are this and we'll get them at 90 or 120 and it'll be perfect right now Brady does that because he's a [ __ ] magician I mean there's still a little art I mean I'm sure you could be there's a lot of art still in this process I mean like all good cutting-edge science we have some good tool box like understandings of the apparatus and the methodology of what we're trying to do but we're trying to push it right we're trying to find the new and we're trying to make it scalable of course right so you know how if we can effectuate this photographic way it'll allow others to go and it'll allow us to maybe go through different supply chains quicker in terms of evaluating as opposed to test washing every which takes time but which is also fun but yeah it's an intimate process and now that we have some strings and we're gonna standardize you know I've called for four of them like I'll still let the guys play because of course that's part of the industry you always want to have the new new and some inconsistent product but business demands and pressures are me to be like can we just have like the same screen at the dispensary all the time yes I guess but you're like that's what you should want different stuff and I do one and I am look we're towing the line I hope that at one point we'll be like a sneaker company when we drop a strain on IG people show up and it sells out and we that happens a little bit we have some fan following but that's the level of quality of the product I don't think that's too much to ask for quality but we will put a consistent product we thought about like putting a lower tier product as a high-end brand that's always a difficult choice to make to like have a lower price point product to suppose we're not there yet it's almost like you have to be really big to offer like yeah exactly or like a key chain and Tiffany's or something like that yeah you know something you can have a little something you have a little something but you can't have this you know you only get this on the holidays or something I actually don't believe I don't believe in shiny things at all I love spending money on the things I'm passionate about and I appreciate people are passionate about so it's not really for me to say I definitely want Brady here but I definitely know the garlic cookies is one of them the THC bomb is running in like 8% so of course there's some economics around that oh man like what washed well and had a good like yummy profile and what we could encourage farmers to you know do a few hoop houses or some full term I built out a lot of good climate control store that a lot of [ __ ] walk-in freezers do you power power constraints for walk-in freezers and yeah and we've also you know especially well yeah yeah so we have Webb freezer trucks right and they don't really get frozen on the truck but they definitely spacious yeah right and the truck is definitely it's a freezer but it's not like subs so it's not gonna freeze the product but it'll definitely start to mobilize it and then by the time it gets to the lab you know depending on how far in the hill it is our whatever I immediately gets so Brady you know it's like that thing like the dense coal is like we're wrestling and trying experiment if you start to macerate them you open up cell walls and that potentially is gonna leach things that you don't want but at the same time you want to have surface area there exactly so we've been experimenting with techniques we usually only do smalls right so we partner with the farmers they come through because it again outdoor a little bit different process even from the harvesting perspective so they'll just take all the tops and then they'll just be all the smalls and we come literally the next day so the plants have had those buns have had a chance to like flesh out again right and there you see they're all and then we just stripped them and how we macerate them is definitely something the breeding watches carefully because while we want surface area we also have to be careful not to break the plan up too much to let out certain things that hands right now although if I had to shout out pure pressure for sure we use peer pressure presses and we use peer pressure stainless steel washing drums 50% because some people still love a [ __ ] trash can food save trash can and we paddle by hand and we do use peer pressure paddles we use professor rosin bags so you know yeah I mean again that's just that denver connection those are my people the equipment is good you know it's like they're at least you're trying to scale the solvent was there are other other company other couple of companies out there while we do a lot of humble centric stuff pure pressure is definitely one of the brands that we work with it's not in Humboldt and there are like sasquatches some rosin folks up north that we could partner with but right now we mostly use peer pressure equipment and lots of hands and TLC that has to be hits yeah that's people literally like yeah and we and it's definitely our team we used to let them do it and it would show up in totes and like Brady's a perfectionist I think most extraction artists are professionist like he takes these jars and how does his team wipe them out because they came from China and if it leaves black on the foot I'm just like I kind of get shocked by the labor but you cannot argue quality yeah exactly yeah like yeah he wants you know he's got this guy clean blood coming in he's like we're like we're building clean rooms to make cash and I'm like okay I get it I'm with it right so yeah so we have to go and take the product the right way and like wow you know some of it believe it or not to investors and whatnot and like if I to people who may not understand I'm like it's just for the ritual of it I will I will articulate to the public and document this process but this is not crazy winemakers do it spirit makers do it craft people do this kind of thing to create quality products it's on us as business people our marketing people to articulate that to the consumer and people love that this is beyond grand story of course we're taking all the videos in the drug is gold exactly people to see it yeah but I would argue that it's still it's still a part of the scientific process because the fact that you go out and do it puts accountability on you which is really important to the scientific process someone has to have been the one who did the thing so you can report back and know what happened so you just have so much more data when you can go and be there at the source you know like it's really easy to be fooled when a grower says I never spray anything if you never go into their grow if you go into their grow to harvest their stuff and there's flying bugs in the air you may have the answer and so like that relationship is important for transparency which is also important for that scientific process so as artistic as it might be I think it's still very mathematical I think you could still absolutely calculate the business advantage that comes from that because you won't end up making a poor decision based on a lack of information if you are more hands-on or at least you won't be able to make that mistake twice right because you'll have made it you'll learn all the way through that problem yeah and it's awesome because like we see people like getting like some of the younger members just getting more knowledgeable and like yeah there's no phoning in hash that's other thing is our guys are incentivized like unlike our other workers you if you don't show up to this job whether it's at the farm or while your hand paddling you will lose quality you will lose extraction arey and that's money I mean I think it's all extractors right so whoever is running your equipment regardless of the methodology they have to be in the game right even if it's you if you think it's automated then you're just making crude if you're trying to make a quality product every like nuance needs to pay attention if somebody is not heart's not in it or they're not some some way tied to the economics or the other side that's right and not then all of a sudden it's not a craft product right if you were I mean if you were to compare it to food it's like someone who you know just makes Haribo gummy bears and a factory there make the same thing all day every single day it does not matter what they think or feel about the product that they're making but if you take that to like someone who makes you know confections and a bakery one day they make maybe these little cupcakes one day they make the little candy decorations that go on the cupcakes the next day they're making different icing for all of the different other cakes that they're gonna make them make the next week and so the diversity of products that they make is really what makes them good at their job they might make the same type of gummy bear that someone who works in a factory makes but those someone who works in a factory can't come in and make a different type of gummy bear also so it doesn't make me a good extractor to make good hash out of one thing one time like that just happens what makes you good at it is to be able to make good hash out of everything that you take in and to be able to repeat it all of the time with wildly different material because even when you're talking about like I've got four that I really like those four aren't coming in at the same bag size that you're choosing they're not coming in probably even with the same temperature and pressing necessarily the size of batch that you're gonna run at a time might be different based on the way that they yield like all of those parameters make them individual products every time I have a different strain even if I get the same consistency out of it like I'm still making something totally new and so that's that's like the expertise is that you need you need versatility to be able to do this all the time and you can't phone in versatility you can phone in a repetitive process but even when you do the same thing it's not the same the scaling comes in getting such a large team to be able to be on the same page all the time well talk to me about one thing which is if the concept of long-term aging of hash like a lot of times cannabis has always been like it needs to be consumed now like the best time to consume it is immediately whereas some stuff you can you know cure it and age it for a long term and then you could have concepts of like oh the 2015 year was amazing and these things peak like 3 to 6 years out so anywhere and then your batches become more valuable yeah I mean that's more in Frenchie's game I guess right and you know cured hash is definitely not my personal skill set but yeah there's definitely yeah and that's you know so that's an interesting one too you know I think flowers are definitely perishable you can immobilize them to a good end but that's all you're doing it's like terpenes or VOCs they want to go they're gonna oxidize whether you smoke them or not it's not like wine in that bottle but definitely true Moroccan hash can age and definitely gets older and more CBN e'en more sleepy and but it has a distinct taste aroma and you know that's uh I can see I could see that and like cigars in the future and like that's what you put in it like a good like Hanna gar like freshly rolled with like old like you know 20 year old Moroccan hash or something like that maybe we'll get there I don't know I mean I'm sure there are people that are passionate about those products but yeah anyway I'm fortunate have to start to bounce when you guys dude I did promise we have a tour of cannabis dispensaries to hit before and get back here at one point so I've got uh let's see got some sour clam over here and then raspberry Lachi and white cookies and then you brought with car the cookies mainly papaya wedding crashers these last few events I've had a good time just like posting up like this and just like that's like Frenchie French cheese heaven is like that's the best way to spread the word though you can't argue with this I have the best picture like with Frenchie in the background like wafting the cold and that is a completely different smoke smoking experience regularly this definitely has I mean even again the drawing the curing you know with our something like this hash for use of freeze drying I mean that's like next-gen dry right it's not the same art and curing but the freeze dried it has its nuances to be sure well what are the the freeze dryer like its pluses and minuses versus above my paper honestly it's like those kids have better I can tell you a little bit about what's it called sublimation or vacuum sublimation whenever the type of a term for freeze drying is and why it works but yeah the nuances and the timing and look it's all in the prep right so it becomes a hand feel how they lay out so makes me out you know as it comes out of the bags you scoop it up and it looks like sand basically you know the thickness that that paddy is how it gets stacked in the oven same thing with working of a coven right it's like right now I feel like I feel like I used to understand my back of course like to Marie's point there's numbers somewhere so and bring the number back and then all of a sudden that would bring like the cooks experience back to front right because in a way I guess what science data is your recipe right you go back in like oh these were the view of the variables that I use and it worked perfectly right so even things like testing just different thicknesses and being like oh yeah yeah I mean I mean I'm sure my hidrom\u00e9is are just the way you pack your columns way to get the materials macerated all of it and it's wildly different so I'm sitting on a panel the other day with a guy from hammer mill like that like grind [ __ ] to a pump and I'm thinking oh right but there are people out there especially on the side like what a masturbation sawdust you see a massive surface here you blasted right they get dark as crude oil but then they were finding it to distillate anyway so just big eyes you know stress is the hardest way to make distillate because you have to do so much pose much like prep like it's just you know it's the longest road grease it the same you know high purity product if you would just be faster than the first silly all right well I'll see you guys later yeah we're gonna run in by some desert weed it's funny they're like part of the job", "UKYpi07Z3Pg": "in this video we will talk about how terpenes influence your cannabis choice terpenes are highly aromatic compounds that determine the smell of many plants and some animals an example of this would be to

Futurama of Virology Soroka really important area of Korea Babel tower Corey Perry babe okay thank you", "hMYxdRmZ5l0": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to be pressing some vanilla berry pie 20 point 18 percent THC from three boys farm which is now known as one plant but it was a three boys farm at the time on my 10 tongue that press drip tech dab press nah it's a dead press and it's called dead press so there you go all right so this vanilla berry Piatt is the first order I ever made from one plant and it was a really dry batch with not much smell to it and so I threw in some intent and type of booze pack and all these things to moisten it up it's like 60 - I think it's 52 percent humidity I'm not exactly sure here you can take a look at it inside here I'll give it a small it's got its got a berry smell to it now you're back then I really didn't have much of a smell to it and these do have a good effects these nugs but I think bringing it back to life with the integra was a necessity for sure here's a a nice shot of these nodes before I give them the press like I said they had decent effects even though the flowers themselves were unimpressive alright let's go ahead and get these buds weighed in and that way we can have an idea of what the yield is like go ahead and tear out the scale nodes these are actually pretty decent looking lugs and they they smell again now that I put the booth back in there all right looks like it's 3.5 grams on the money I don't know if you can see that alright and I use the trottle tech method I'm not sure if anybody out there is familiar with it but basically I use a 120 micron mesh bag but cut off at both ends and I'll show you how that works probably need to get something to break this stuff up on I just like to break it up a little bit so that smushes nice and tight into the filter bag if there's any big stems like this I'm just pulling out so I had pressed um some from this batch before and it didn't pretty had really really um disappointing results I don't know if it had been fully rehydrated at that point or not though so who knows alright so now we have an eight broken up right here on this piece of paper is a little bit I'm gonna take the filter bag and just start stuffing it full of weed basically there's definitely a lot more aroma now that I've broken this all up I found another stem in there I'm going to take that outside and break the bag or break through the parchment either you just gotta stuff all this stuff in there basically a couple more little stems in there if this suckers out luckily I don't think I see any seeds go grab something real quick but my help in this there's no escaping the drawer of doom alright so I just basically got a flat it's just a kitchen tool with a flat dough on the bottom handle swing smooch this down basically want to get this as compressed as possible so you can fit all of it in here and have a little puck going on inside the bag that's what I'm trying to get accomplished and so I believe the expected yield I heard something like it you know a good yield should be something like 2% under the stated THC percentage and I've gotten that that seems to be a pretty good rule of thumb I have to say but we'll see what this one does every strain is different every batch is different it depends on the growing conditions on all kinds of stuff the maturity level when they were harvested lots of variables that go into getting a good squish as they say and um so just so you know I'm not I don't want this to be all broken up like this into shake that just happened when I was breaking it up so you know ideally you just want to break it up a little bit so it fits into a puck shape inside here all right now I have my finished shuttle tech puck to be squished and turn into rosin smells pretty good good look at it yeah it's all smushed into a puck and I actually could have had a little bit less of this filter bag right here but that's okay it's not a huge deal I scrape this very last bit of crumbs on there all right but we have our eight of vanilla berry pie all puffed up in our shuttle tech bag we need to set up the damn press to get ready to be pressing some tabs how about that so I'm gonna adjust the camera and get right over there alright so first I need to turn on the heating plates there we go finally and I like to start out at 180 so I'm gonna take that down I just like to do my first passes at lower temperatures to preserve as many Terps as I can gotta have them terpene you know that's what rosin is all about is the Terps otherwise you just have other forms so we got that going at 180 the gauge on this I draw a camp up here that's what's gonna be operating you can see you once gets to 180 it'll be ready to go ready to press some dad's out press some nose alright so now that I've got the heating plates heating up from the PID with up to 180 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and get the press set up between two sheets of parchment paper for the first month all right ready to go all right I've got it all set up just like I need it these I just use cheap bulk parchment paper because I still have this thing in it it just won't seem to run out so I use I double up because it'll press through the parchment paper which is not a huge deal so yeah you just put the button in here give it a press there you go we're just gonna wait for that heat up and once it's ready will squish somebod all right now that the temperature plates are heated up what I'm gonna need to do is take this puck right here and slide it between the plates just like this and you want it to be just kind of centered like that and towards the front a little bit is what I prefer so that it can kind of direct it to come out that way yeah that's just right give me a second guys so after I get the puck in here I like to just so I haven't really started to put much pressure at all on it right now it's just strictly heating up at this point all right so it's been heating up for over a minute now so I go ahead and just start a timer right when I start applying pressure to this and I'm just going to try it as much as I can just keep applying steady pressure to this and I usually take it up to the 4000 on the PSI scale rear and then I'll be able to swing this camera in right here so that we can help you of the drip close-up so let's go ahead and get that started all right it's starting to start the timer as soon as I start to feel the resistance of the pump all right I can feel it so now I'm gonna start it I'm gonna do one minute for the first squish probably not the most exciting quite yeah I'm actually gonna swing that hammer right now hopefully we'll get a nice view of the squish going on all right well I'm a little bit over a minute and we don't get no squishies out of here I guess I don't have enough in there or it's not gonna yield as much as it would need to make a squish that's been in there long enough though so I'm gonna go ahead pull it and to do that undo this toppling like over here what's probably going on here is it just didn't have enough didn't have enough trichomes and stuff to push it out at that temperature all right nice and aromatic that is there's the first squish you say I'm going through the paper there a little bit that's all right we get it put that in the freezer all right so I put the first squish in the freezer and then we'll go ahead and get the second stick ready this is the same thing over again [Music] looks like the bag broke a little bit on that one I went a little too fast so you know usually I try to go pretty slow didn't work out that time so now I'm gonna put the temperature up to 210 degrees all right so I've turned up the temperature to 210 degrees on the plates I like to do that first press at 180 to get as many Terps and you know the nicest press that I can and then I go up to 210 after that to get as much as I can out of now I'll even go up to 220 for the last one so once this is all heated up then I'll be ready to do the second press I've got the plates up to 210 degrees and I've got the puck here so I'm just gonna slide there we go let that heat up just about 30 seconds or a minute or so all right now that it has heated up for about a minute I'm gonna go ahead and start putting some pressure on it this time I'm gonna take it slower so I don't totally destroy it I'm just trying to apply even pressure as much as I can throughout the whole time hid key to sort of get a little tougher up in these thousands give you a nice arm workout well it looks like there's a little bit coming out this time all right a little bit didn't have this already did a about 220 it's starting to drip and I've gone longer than a minute that's for sure I'm missing all of this camera tank sorry this is so bad there we go a bit more pressure just a little bit more now that we got it hurtin and it's just such dark rosin I'm not used to that but same thing happened with the other batch of three boys that I pressed so who knows all right that's plenty of time not too shabby on the second place smells nice it's kind of hippy all right so now we're gonna get the third press down here I'm gonna put this into the freezer let harden up all right so now that the plates are heated up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit I'm ready to go ahead and put the puck in but first I'm gonna have a little shot glass of water right here and I'm gonna just dab a little bit of water on each side of it now just help push out the last of the dabs last of the rosin I should say just that pressure of the vapor a little bit just a little bit of pressure so I can start heating up plates heat up the puck for about a minute or so to bring it up to temperature and that's just to help get the juices flowing basically all right now that the puck has heated up in the press for about a minute I'll go ahead and start applying more pressure slowly as I go at 220 degrees Fahrenheit and hopefully we'll see a little bit come out again it's always nice when you get to see the drip don't see any coming out yet tighten up a little bit still nothing look we should definitely be getting more rosin out that's for sure oh here comes something right there very nice very nice third press and since this is the last press I'll just let this go throw away for a minute and a half two minutes you can pretty good this is on the prison prettiest rosin I've seen that's for sure mm-hmm but I'm sure see what the yield is like press that's a pretty decent press right there for the third press but you can see it is there's a lot less of it Wow very nice berry flavor to this last press interesting what if the water help right now all right so I'll put this in the freezer like the other ones and then it will be back with all of them once they're all frozen and we'll gather them up and I'll tell you what the yield was all right so here I've got the first press and I collect it now as you can see I went through the paper but that's not a huge deal you still get this all up alright so I've got the first press collected and there it is as you can see there's you know there's some stuff on here there's no all my fingers but that's the vast majority of it right there I'm just going to throw it onto a piece of parchment paper for right now and then we'll weigh them all up together at the end get as much of this off as I can but it won't be exact that's for sure mark this is number one I set it over here all right now on to collect the second press here we had the second press and I hope it'll be easier than the first to collect nope it's shattering - let's see how it does that's not so bad all right and here's the second press put this on a piece of parchment also this has got like a taffy consistency to it label that number two and we'll collect the third and final press and then we'll weigh it all up and see what our yield was - stuff like this of course don't touch your rug further than final price right here so I'm going to collect it and you'll know just exactly how much we got is the third press right there number one go ahead and tear out the scale with a piece of the parchment on it sure it's not touching here we go got that tear it out now I'll transfer attached to this parchment and that is point one seven five grams from the first press and it has a really interesting consistency to it it's waxy it's like it's barely even sticky I mean it is but it's nothing like the other pretty cool so I'll mark this you tell the batch number then I'm gonna put it back in the freezer I'll grab the second one all right there's the second batch go ahead and tear out the scale again just like before transfer it over easier to do when it's frozen make sure it's not touching yep not touching 0.18 one second do it a little bit better than the first one which is not surprising because the second one had 210 degrees well unit 108 so there's not as much energy to push out all that rosin all right and they go ahead and tear out the last one transfer one more time whoops I have to wait a trick on this one here we go make sure it's not touching all right it's point zero seven eight there's a tiny bit more on here let me get that so I put this there was a little bit left on there I don't see what's a point seven eight so didn't really add a point seven eight point seven nine point eight let me close this really point seven nine twenty seven eight I'll just call it point seven eight 0.078 all right so label this one this one is a lot stickier look at that it's a lot stickier and that's the last one it has the water so now we'll add these all up and see what our yield was 175 that's point one a one plus point zero seven eight equals point four three four 12.4% yield man that is not good you at all it's just terrible and this is the same thing that happened last time that I pressed this stuff you know I mean I realize look you got a little bit right here but man this is some bad yield right here for 20% so I don't know what the deal is with these I definitely get a lot more out of Tru leave and let's see well if I Curie if gave me some good stuff to so let me mark this off for number three and then we'll take a look at the different batches together here's that one as you can see I mean it doesn't even want to stick to the paper you see that it's hard it barely wants to stick to the paper if you touch it it will stick to your finger because of the heat but other than that it really doesn't want to stick let's batch one at 180 degrees that's too similar but it is a little bit stickier and it seems to be a little unruly or two you see how it's like flakes off like that yeah I don't really like touching batch two very much I'm gonna get rid of it well we just ahead of my fingers and then batch three as we put the water in it much more of an oily consistency and just like before this is all really dark stuff compared to what I'm used to I will press some buds from a you know different dispensary soon and we'll see well you'll see the difference I don't I don't get it I don't understand what the deal is but I mean I would think that the first one would be a nicer color than that but the thing is this stuff is really potent and the smell is nice it concentrates all that smell down from the bud alright guys I just wanted to show you how I press rosin at home and next time I'll make sure and use a screen that gives us a little bit better stuff you know I just had this kicking around for a while now and I figured I might as well get something out of it what I'll do is I think I'll do one more press on this at some other point and I'll tell you if I get anything else out of it alright thanks for watching you guys have a good one", "z6Jh9VVmhUg": "much better no way yeah okay we are recording now great so I would like to welcome everyone to

Bunch you're a lively bunch of artists ambition but coming on the heels of the devastation of the wildfires what's the pulse in Australia right now are the artists feeling demoralized because of all the natural disasters or as the attitude pretty healthy there's a bit of a mixture but I think there's a dawning realisation so the the eternal optimism of artists is something that I mean it's just wonderful and I think over the last few weeks as we've heard the media and and and things grow and the corona virus spread throughout the world there was a sort of a starting point of all this is just crazy this is an overreaction and now as it's sort of our borders have been closed today so you now have to or not close but you have to go into our enforced isolation any of international travelers coming into the country well as of today so I mean obviously now it's affecting artists and I think the realization that their income for the next three to six months is severely affected so this is still is incredible Australians are very buoyant and I think we show that in the bushfires the talk around artists were performing for us to perform for free to raise money in our recent bushfires and now our artists are the ones that elite meeting to be looked after and they need some help yeah well that's unfortunate I see Veronica are you available to introduce yourself now still having connection issues okay my next question is for you matthew dragoon has canceled shows in China several weeks ago when the outbreak began in a lot of ways dragon and China you're ahead of everyone else in this crisis what measures did you take to help the artists and the shows and what would you advise theatres and circus companies to do at this point well there's none from a public health perspective there's no distinction between circuses or anything really if there's there's certain governmental dictation which are important obviously we follow those and contribute to them the one of the advantages that we have some of the shows that we do is that they've been running for a long time at the massive organizations so in that we already have done a huge internal education process for security protocols and everything else and also internal communications we have typhoon protocols we have also health protocols from people that have any kind of communicable diseases we had that in the city today when people were freaking out about someone who had HIV and how we deal with that and all the rest of it so rather than reinventing something we need to knock on the door that's already open within our staff people are educated we have a communal response we have what we call SOPs which is standard operating procedures and all that but because we've utilized that entire mechanism it's really knocking on the door that's already open so we have community forums we have weekly meetings and we have departmental meetings and we make sure that everyone understands we ask the questions and the QA and all the rest of it and we do the communication but rather than getting a memo we do it on a very hands-on fashion of course that one meter five distance but so it's really in terms of the management a different subject but the same mechanism so not to demystify the significance of it but if you appeal to the intelligence of people rather than spend all your time reassuring everybody you get a collective response which is really different so I really encourage us I know I prepared for this somewhat it's not to do a speech but as I've thought about it a lot because we have a show in Wuhan how does the epicenter supposedly of this mm-hm and and they're all circus community but because it's been a community for four years but after a one and a half year creation period of developing how we operate within that building and all the rest of it with a huge international component we have all the mechanisms to deal with Alda so from a dragon or scepter Soleil which is a phenomenally well coordinated touring I'm still well connected with them from a drug on anyone else I would propose if anyone has any questions about how we do this beyond this forum please contact me and we can go on to all kinds of things that go from the training how we you with the communications not the PR but the internal communications and also for anyone that's teaching circus it's a fantastic opportunity to use this as a platform for where you're going in your careers because it doesn't have to do with kovat which is a subject matter which provokes this forum it's very unfortunate that cobra would provoke this forum but it's very positive that you're doing it so this norm is to communicate what we're doing but also amongst ourselves as a community so please contact me and me is not meeting me as a huge body of people that know what they're doing and share more happily about that but are we doing well yes we've closed down the shows it will be with your cousins we're keeping the trainings on certain ones or taking care of our people and also just on the positive side with five large shows that have over 400 people just in show crew no one in the greater community has been affected in any way that's very amazing actually Thank You Matthew Stephan I have a question for you circus strata and other organizations like FedEx and ohnpeace they're very well place to help convey protocols and support to companies and artists have you been receiving many more requests for guidance and what is your organization doing for to help companies that have been halted whose work has been halted and also a few questions for you Stefan sorry are you advocating to the government for assistance at this point okay I'm gonna try to answer those maybe in an orderly fashion first of all what we have been doing is we compile the list of resources and information together with on the move which is a mobility network and it's freely available on the on the move website so you can go and check it out and it's updated regularly not only by us and on the move but by everyone wants to put some new piece of information second of all what we're gonna do tomorrow we're gonna launch either a Google spreadsheet or or I think a form I don't know yet the the shape it's gonna take to survey how many festivals or show have been cancelled across the word concerning circus and street arts because we work for both what I've encouraged some members is to work alongside other performing arts Network because it's not something that you can do by yourself because we know we belong to a larger family and performing arts belong to a larger family and culture belongs to a larger family because everybody is in this even when you have a restaurant for instance what I know is that I don't think at this very stage us as a circus network or street art network advocating towards government who will do anything let's not kid ourselves so the only thing is that we can do is to gather information for at some point maybe we can use it but right now ministers or public public represented themselves are doing the job because I know that there have been talks already in England because ACA sent a message today Finland is doing the same France is doing the same sort of thinking about developing either new schemes or adjusting existing one to cover some costs from the cancellations and am I missing something from your question again or yeah yeah mute have you received a lot of emergency requests from artists and companies for guidance not directly I've received one official letter from our Italian members because I think they were the first to actually face this situation at the same stage where we're facing it in France or in other countries today so which I shared with the steering committee of the network which prompt us to do a series of action which I'm gonna share on Monday with the rest of the members so we have sort of a some delay times to process information and to you know share it because we have a certain level of governance that we have to you know apply and but I on Monday that's the information that I'm gonna share but I didn't receive directly from I mean I've seen it on social media of course like everyone else I'm just trying to keep track and trying to also be slowly there with people I know in the industry who were facing you know like a B&L cancellation or a festival cancellation or a show cancellation so but I mean we have also to take into consideration the larger picture and not to it's good that to have a conversation between ourselves for whatever it means but it's it's much larger and we need just to play a role where we are right now are you can you hear us can you introduce yourself well I think I think Veronica's still having difficulties okay so Victoria I have a question for you upswing received support from the Arts Council of England do you have faith that organisations like this will be able to advocate for the arts and to get emergency funding to help artists maintain a base income during this time what alternative funding sources might artists tap into right now so I think it's it's important to recognize the context in which this is happening eating we have a situation in the UK where some organisations receive core funding from the Arts Council there are a very small number there are about I think five mpos that's main businesses circus and we receive funding I don't think there are any mpos in the UK an MPO is a national portfolio organisations so it's an organization that receives core subsidy from Arts Council on a four year cycle and there aren't any mpos that are in the larger bands that get like a significant amount of funding so we're all on kind of survival rations as I call it and the vast majority of people in the UK circus sector are independent freelancers and they normally at this point return to working in hospitality you know industries that are also feeling a massive crunch from the corona virus epidemic so it's it's quite a difficult situation I'm talking to a lot of people at the moment who are looking at completely empty summer seasons and massive uncertainty about what's going to happen beyond then the Arts Council today was released a statement where they have recognized that that need is is present and they are looking how they can adjust some of their existing funding pots to deal with people experiencing loss of earnings we've had solo governmental response but all of our governmental response has been around people who experience sickness or need to self isolate so it hasn't really addressed what happens if you actually can't make any any money and because of the the situation you know and I think it's important to recognize that hardship that kind of financial hardship for independent artists is is a really really difficult one to face so the Arts Council England our responded but they're very limited in terms of what they can do you know they haven't got endless pots of money and this is going to be a significant problem not just across you know the Arts Council support theater dance music you know every kind of every other artistic practice in the UK and circus is a very very very small part of their portfolio of organizations as I said and it's a it's a sector that doesn't have a lot of infrastructure in the UK to support independent artists so it's it's really challenging times it's it's really heartening to see that Arts Council are starting to respond to this I think they're limited in what they'll be able to do and we need to find other ways in which we can support each other yes I agree that's important to think about and that's hopefully something we can discuss after we ask everyone their questions just what people are doing in their local communities - yeah um Thank You Vicky Nikki you're an artist you're an instructor and this past week you felt motivated to act really quickly on the topic of safety and circus spaces and edge in schools even now schools and spaces are closing down but at the time you were talking about protocols and working with Stephen Santos from safety and whatsit is it safety in aerial arts yeah as more studios and schools close do you think that this is the right decision for global health right now and what do you think the impact beyond the economic health of the students and educators right now and what do you hear in your community going around at this point yeah well I think it's absolutely the right thing for these spaces to be closing right now you know my concern initially was around the lack of information of transmission and surfaces and you know the amount you know of the amount of things that we put our hands specifically on in a circus training space and the impossibility of washing hands in between every engagement with a object and whether that's an apparatus or you know the thing that really got me was when I you know I was like talking like okay well we could you know wash this we could get like silks on rotation if we're talking about fabric specifically and we could wash those and then we could dry others and then we could swap them out but then it was like oh no but if you have like powder rosin then all the students and all the instructors and whoever is there is gonna be all putting their hands in the same powder bras and so we can't use powdered rosin well why don't you spray we don't want you there it's all and like just sort of recognizing all of these pieces and the complication of just like of really doing that responsibly in some way that could be at all shared and like that you know which is really heartbreaking that you know this this you know circus basis function as a place where people come together it's a like have an embodied you know hang out you know an experience I shared a shared time of being physical and so it is and you know especially in New York you know we have a ton of studios and they all function differently some are you know recreational classes that are you know yoga studios that offer aerial classes or pull studios and some are like full you know circus like multi-purpose circus spaces that are you know have school programs you know we don't have credentialed schools here like in like in Europe in Canada but you know they have schools that offer like pre professional intensive programs so students do enroll in a durational painting so range of police is pretty broad in the way that people engage that those places is really broad and we have a huge nightlife sector in New York so there's like a ton of gay people who gig and perform on you know House apparatus and clubs and stuff like that so just like anticipating all of this I I wanted to start to like propose some possibilities that occurred to me and make a working document that other folks could join on which is what I did and the Stephan Santos who's you know many of you and if you know is like a very expert rigger and you know very very conscientious students of safety and and physics and all the reals he started putting together his own document and so we've gotten her to sort of centralized information and now it's just really clear that it just makes more sense for spaces to close one thing Nikki to note that you know even though at this point it does make sense for spaces to close as they predict that this illness will be around for a while those sanitation techniques when spaces reopen will probably still be valid and needed so it's good that you have shared that and continue to update it and we appreciate that and hopefully it's a resource that we can list in our resources with everyone else that is adding to their documents today Thank You Mickey um adult though you learned last week or are you you've been in quarantine for a while now and we just learned this past week that festival up is going to be canceled a lot of thirty-plus shows are not happening again Italy is a little ahead of the rest of the world and the thick of this pandemic where does this strike you on the I mean is it because the pandemic is so intense there that this seems just like a minor thing to have these cancellations and it's necessary or our artists in your country still reeling from the economic implications and how do you think that we can all rebound from this quicker but this is I think is not very clear and it was not clear two weeks ago that this is globally going over everywhere sooner oh so this is a really a different scenario from two weeks or even one months ago we thought in the beginning that China was so far away that this thing was staying within China and now right now Italy has been yes being locked down somehow it's not complete lockdown like in China but people are sent home asked to stay home for a week or two already and now we realize that we part of this big global society and market there is no way that any country is going to get rid of these by itself because even if we started the current and before it maybe results we come before that in other countries then we have to wait for the entire economy to restart again and so they consider it also there's so many European project they saw so many Network says so much we are so much mingle together that it's difficult than one country star survives us comes out of this by self and what we have done so far for the community but what we're doing within our organization is to keep the people together keep the people in touch okay so we're working across we have a form that we exchange our views we best practice good practice whatever ideas or whatever despair you have to share and the second step is to start advocating the tables where measures are already been taken for for fighting and for fighting this crisis okay somehow we wrote to a circle strategy at the bay and together with other partners in Italy and this is already happening inside the Ministry of Culture and inside the government there's already lots of advocating for each field so this had the true okay the two measures okay locally for the community and in together with all the other sectors and so what we had to do okay first we have to see this this uh this um copy the excavation slowing down and then stop this is something nobody can predict anything because until this is ending there's nothing we can predict and then after we have to consider how we can all bounce back okay because there would be a time when this is over but there's a lot of remains around us okay there's lots of cry tears and so we let to assess okay the damage and then realize all together which resources we have to stoop bounce back okay this I think this is my feeling from my point of view a personal point thank you doleful I appreciate that Veronica I'm still hoping that we can hear you are you there oh okay well Veronica if you if you pop on we'll keep listening for you Vincent you just had some bad news about the festival being canceled and one of your shows soprano was canceled and I believe your circle funds shows were also canceled what repercussions are the artists struggling with now from these cancellations and have you given them any some advice for support yes well actually all over Quebec were more under the shock of of the news first last Thursday Thursday or prime minister announced that it will be measure for salary people but in Quebec a probably seventy to eighty percent of the people that work in the show business are a self-employed so everybody reacted very strongly to that reality that we're in dipped in deep luckily we have a government that is very responsive to the artist and Monday tomorrow morning there is a big big meeting with the Ministry of God the Minister of Culture Natalia hua and all the associations and unions of artists to determine how they can cope with the financial reality of all those cancellations at this point most Quebec artists tour internationally so I think in the last days the challenge has to be finding tickets to go back home last minute also so that also brings another reality of now the shows are canceled so we have no revenues but we have to pay for all these changes of air fares and so on so that's something we have I'm still trying to find a strategy to ask theaters that cancel as if they could give us a hand on that then the next challenge is everybody that is coming back will now be in quarantine for 14 days so so these people have to stay home but the whole business all you are all the artists all the acrobats they will have no place where to to rehearse so that that's at least at least for the next 14 days but honestly I believe it's going to be all a month of April and probably all the month of May so they're going to have a reality how they're going to keep fit and how are they going to keep their level of discipline their acrobatic address at the same height because when business is going to start back they'll need to be ready but will they be ready so that's something that will have to be addressed at some point so that's pretty much what's worrying me I didn't have any messages from very worried artists now the national national circus school is responding that the school is closed for the next two weeks and the all the graduates they have this this exam called a puff Santa's in and mid-april that is happen but with no lights only the internal people of the school we attend to it normally it's not open to public but you have the families of the artists the acrobats that come that come to that so and for them they've been preparing for the last three years for that moment that's really the moment where you get your diploma and can leave school and have a bright future so so we hope that it will be fine as a perspective of agent it's really trying to deal with the first major article the clause in a contract you know at the beginning we had like France its Cirque Alfonse was touring France so they cut all events for one thousand and more now it's the Thomas was going on so I think that's one thing you have to be thinking in all your future contracts is how to have a good force majeure clause that from the day it happens you're not just left by yourself you know yeah so that's pretty much it so I'm very happy to see that our government is really responding really well and I'm not talking about the Canadian government who is I think quite lousy in their response the Quebec government has been very proactive and reassuring towards the people and all the people the working force so that's quite the positive for us Thank You Vincent um I do want to ask if anyone if any other governments from your different locations have had a similar response but first it looks like Veronica is here so I'm going to give Veronica a chance to unmute their mic hello can you last chance yes can you hear me yeah you you hear me okay so can I talk okay my name is Veronica stefanova I'm representing silicon center for contemporary circus in the Czech Republic the umbrella organization for the contemporary circus in the Czech Republic and maybe I can briefly describe the situation here in our country sure so did you Republic yes yes Queen Czech Republic declared on Thursday March 12 the state of emergency which means that government banned foreigners from entering the Czech Republic in checks travelling abroad from Saturday March 14 all bus train and boat transport passengers well everything that is going from abroad or from Czech Republic abroad has been cancelled because or it's not working we can't cross the borders schools are closed high schools elementary schools universities or later centers sports centers service centers music school etcetera all shops except grocery stores and pharmacies so it's pretty much the same situation as in Italy and today it's Sunday and we are waiting what the government is going to declare but we are going to be put probably in the current een as well all cultural artistic as for events must have been canceled so what does that mean especially for the NGO sector which means independent and non-profit organizations so in last couple of days we heard mainly from the theatres and companies from the NGO sector which means those companies that are not established and funded by the state cities or regions they stated that the government imposed restrictions on gathering people will deprive hundreds of thousands or millions of Czech crowns for some it could be the end of their existence and many artists may be put into very complicated financial difficulties so the Ministry of Culture entrusted the arts and theatre Institute to map the impact of the emergency measures on the Czech independent arts sector the data collection collected by the questionnaire survey should be submitted to the Ministry next week so on Monday which means tomorrow the government should discuss also the material that would enable the self-employed to provide loans up to half a million of crowns they should primarily cover operational matters so that's what they we heard so far but we will be more clever tomorrow which is mondays or probably not if there is current II yeah that's amazing Veronica it sounds like your government is taking a lot of proactive steps and Quebec as well that's good to hear does anyone else have any details specific to who their governments actions that seem hopeful for the performing arts community that go beyond just the trying to quell the help the health impacts or is it too soon for that Nikki you said you have something to say or though there's a couple of us here in the US but you know in terms of non government responses you know we have such a dominant that the private sector has such a dominant you know impact on on us and so you know over here we're having various utility companies suspend payments or offer options for folks who you know lose income to submit some sort of piece of information two months from now to wave you know service fees for electricity gas internet that kind of thing but you know in New York specifically they've temporarily frozen evictions so that people aren't forced to leave and in close to home space under the circumstances although I don't really know what that's gonna mean on the other side whenever that is and there's also I've been seeing I don't understand this a lot but I saw someone put something on Facebook yesterday about some sort of cash assistance application for folks who aren't able to pay rent loss of employment but I don't know how much money is available for that I don't fully understand who's providing it what the terms are and you know my big question around that is you know it's just there's so many chains of money passage that it's like where where is it even like where were you where to start where to be stopping this kind of a circumcised those are things that um that is specifically that are happening from the private sector sort of jumping in because our government in the US is you know slow to react thank you you want to add something I'm you know the UK government has has done a few things I mean it's it's very focused on trying to keep business going as much as possible so for example it's changed its policies around how freelancers and self-employed people can access unemployment benefits and it's looking at one on one negotiations with individuals about their tax payments whether they can be deferred to to a later date so there is there is some stuff happening but again most of their actions is focused around people who are actually suffering from illness or can't demonstrate they've had to self isolate because of because of Kerr device virus rather than loss of income due to mention right yeah worrying with the crisis right now rather than prevention stuff I wanna add some yes hi on the link that I shared at the beginning there is a compilation of statements from different ministers so the situation is evolving so quickly then that I think that a conversation that we can have cannot reach a very interesting point we as far as this specific topic because the discussion are happening right now and again there are larger than the cultural industry so there are some things that are happening I know in France in Finland in the UK officially there might be other things in other countries and as soon as there is something which is official which is something we should pace ourselves on it will be posted on you know for instance this website or other website so now you can check it out there are some information at least over there and it's called on the moon right underneath what were there yeah that's the one yeah okay um I'm Oh Vicky I'm sorry um I was just gonna say something in response to Stephan I think it's really important that right now that we're gathering as much information - for my own kind of advocacy as much as possible because looking at what's going on conversations even with inequity which is focused on the performing arts industry circus has such specific and unique needs that it often falls between the cracks in those conversations right now there is a crisis going on this and much much bigger than the Performing Arts and an our sector but actually it gives us some time right now to gather some information and some advocacy so that when the time is right we can make the case adolfo you were next sir yes thank you yes I wanted to add this up okay of course we have to advocate together for Europeans international and this is good that we have some reference organization in Europe so active mr. Perotti and the scale of this of course right now is the main focus is for the entire institution to face this this virus back 100 more than one on the one was 20 people dying every every day here in Italy so there's a lots of problems in the hospital so of course there's lots of paper going on from one ministry to the other there's lots of questions and requests from different fields and also from the cultural ones okay but to give you an idea like 10 years ago the government was putting on the table 3 billions euros and two days after it was six billion zeros and then it was 13 and now it's 25 billions use germinate foot 500 billions you to some table the other day so we we still don't have the the picture you see there at the picture thank you I have a question for anyone who wants to take it on and that is is there do you think there's something about the infrastructure of or something about Circus in general maybe the infrastructure of our network um that makes us have an advantage for bouncing back from this from this scenario and Nikki you seem ready to jump in go ahead yeah I've been thinking about this honestly since before this to be honest I've been really interested in infrastructure in this Center being in the US where there really isn't any hasn't years or there's sort of minimal or somewhat dysfunctional infrastructure so I think that this is potentially a really valuable opportunity for us to be in dialogue about asking questions and getting on the same page about values and intentions and the function of our art form and how we want to engage culturally as a collective you know effort and bichri you know I think one thing that is we many of us have encountered in panel discussions over at least I've encountered this over the last six years frequently is this question of like what is Circus and there is even disagreement or confusion within our own sector about how to define what we do and who we are and how we relate within a genre but there's also variations within our genre and I think that you know including the fact that performing arts in terms of people coming together and gathering could look very different two years from now or five years from now depending on or three months from now versus five years now or whatever it is and being able to get creative and flexible both about how to be be adaptable to a changing circumstance in which we can still engage with what we do but also an opportunity to get more specific in our language together about how we in the collective and ways that we can better support each other because we are on a similar page where it seems that through until this point there's been a lot of regional isolation both an aesthetic and in terms of practice and then also in terms of economic resource so being able to even identify what's different about those what's functional what's not you know I think this is even an opportunity to examine the fields relationship to capitalism you know I think the economy could have a really different reality and I think that there'll be conversations about that probably happening in other sectors but to be also open and available to what might it look like if we were to engage in a more cooperative way for example or whatever it might be so I'm interested in you know there's a couple of resources that I've always been interested in around this you know one is Adrian Marie Brown's book emergent strategy which I've referenced before in these kind of conversations I think is really valuable at a time like this not and in the u.s. we have a podcast there's a there's an organization called lift economy li ft and paul next economy now where they talk to folks who have either social justice organizations or for-profit organizations that take on different and sort of more ethically and responsible sustainable movements of money and I think that looking at those kinds of look at those kinds of examples and sort of with the kinds of more may be poetic questions we ask as artists and the sort of things that we want to do with our work that sort of that interface and being able to be in that dialogue could feel really cool I agree that's a good point thank you for showing that it looks like Veronica and then dad have something to say and then Matt it looked like you also so let's go Veronica Deb Matt Stefan Roenick yup okay you can still hear me yes great I just wanted to add something probably not not exactly the answer on this question but you were asking about the circus field and how the circus field could react on everything and I would definitely would like to say that everything happened so fast all these venues and theaters were closed here on Tuesday and already on Tuesday evening our famous and one of the biggest circus company circle apotheca which comes from the NGO sector which is independent and non-government organization it was the first one that went online they showed their live show online and they asked people for a donation and it worked very well so they decided to create a platform well we will see tomorrow with change in an hour so I can't tell how it will look like tomorrow at Circular boutique a proposed to other circus artists and performers a platform for online streaming so that is kind of now the thing that is happening in a a Republican circus field that shows a ring life online and there is a private sector that decided to help circus artists but all the independent artists buy a donation and created an online platform and people could add money or send money for the artist that's a brilliant idea I've been wondering how that would pick up I'm sure a lot of online content and online productions will definitely be happening in coming months Deb did you want to add something yeah I think I agree with Mickey there that um this can be an opportunity and that's one of the things that is a particularly great seeing seeing the positive or everyone else sees the negative I agree too with the online streaming we've got to show that's supposed to open in Vancouver on the 14th of April for three weeks the shows there and the theater I mean I haven't spoken to them this weekend but I'd say that's looking increasingly unlikely we haven't cancelled it yet but I'm pretty sure it will be canceled but I've started to work on how we can on stream directory so that because it's a very interactive show the artists need to be able to have an audience they need to see an audience so I'm open to someone here in Brisbane as to how we can set up an audience so that they can see the Vancouver people and then try and get the theater to take that on rather than tencel the show and just see whether this is something that we can do I also think it's another opportunity to look at how we move things around in like our equipment and our and our Freight and things like this which takes look I was talking about a go our freight company the other day and they've got Freight all over the world trying to get it people are trying to get it home and that's sets and especially like big bands and things like that everyone's taking everything home and that it's all going to have to go out again and I've been asking about 3d printing and how we can start to do more of that without with our sets and with our equipment and haven't been able to get really any keen on ethics it's completely outside my my realms experience so I think personally that it is an opportunity for us to do things differently and that that we we're going to try and take some time to try and do some at least one or two of those things to see how it goes and then see how we can build on that so that it can become something stays the new normal that's a good point though but I'm sure that will develop more as time goes by after the crisis level of illnesses especially once things down okay I'm sorry we've just had a show come home from France one closed in Berlin for 30 days and the artists too stuck there we've got out of stuck in France and we just bought people home from Albuquerque and so it's quite like they've got they're all in confinement now it's back and it's yeah it's just really really difficult where I'm getting people back in foreign countries and having to support them remotely just just emotionally I'm sure it's pretty intense weather worried about being far from loved ones and stuff yeah yeah what shows that do you have invert what show did you have in Berlin in France that shut down and it was there's a festival babe at cassis were performing at home as shows you and I and you're the name of the festival um at the moment and the coup is in Berlin that chameleon the chameleons shot for 30 days Veronica I have a question for you specifically and also anyone else that's involved in any future festival planning now like let Neil Ettin is in August right do you think at this point that people are starting to question whether they should cancel so early for these kind of things are they see how things go I'm in touch with festival like Neil Aetna and there are no rumors about canceling the festival or the shows at the moment there are festivals that decided to cancel mostly theatre festivals in May because for them the situation now means they were about to announce the program so but it would be completely stupid to do it now so the let's see April and May festivals they're under yeah there's one circus festival in April in the Czech Republic which is focused on the women in circus and I'm still waiting for the answer from the festival it's gonna be canceled or not but concerning those big festivals such as like Neil Aetna at the moment we still believe it will go on but it's Sunday we will see tomorrow and next week Thank You Matthew and then Vincent Matthew sorry go ahead oh and then Stefan no words so what I'm actually addressing is not specifically circus but in the physical disciplines that include that obviously with the activities that we haven't done they're not government I think because they're spread I work on look at the supply chains if they're set art if there's artists and artisans and it's not about the technicians aren't just in black there's the technical fields there are many people that depend on this sector of activity beyond the on stage performers whose careers may be shorter and a bit more fragile in a certain sense because of what they need to do to maintain the skills not just the physical conditioning doing Pilates is fantastic but it doesn't replace the complicity of working on the refined skill things you can't do on a Pilates ball but with the artisans I'm looking at you buying the Expo 2020 which is rocking maybe the the Tokyo game is being compromised which is immense not necessarily about our industry but what that does to all those supply chains it's huge so in terms of the force majeure that Hassan was speaking about earlier the force majeure has always been sort of what they call in English they call it an act of God which is a bit of a different translation false measure I prefer them making a religious responsibility there but they can the sit-in budgets and everything and the false measure has always been sort of like out clause for investors not pay people and we've dealt with a lot of false measure in hurricanes and US inspection I've been in Big Top swear a false measure comes into play all the time well I think that there's a lesson coming here about the prospecting okay um the Sam Cassell I think that Expo 2020 is a sand castle withstand very near a beach with a big wave coming in they just did and there's a lot of activity there but we're really gonna have to look at not only our artistic activity and the structures that supply schools or academics or even performances there are innumerable quantity of artisans that are going in to go out of business like that and it's happening already there are people whose contracts were not being paid because the deliverables weren't there all this stuff we all know that there's been a lot of campaign that if you bought a ticket which costs dollars don't ask for a refund now because you'll kill our activity and our cultural supply chain if you will it sounds terrible to talk about culture as a supply chain but it is intrinsic what I want to do is to actually underscore the fact that it's an artery if you squeeze the artery you squeeze the circulation artery you can go to a supply chain you can call it anything you want but these arteries are being constricted so when we open up again which we'll do I think that in a in a in a field as a field we really need to analyze where we do our budgetary contingencies and where we deal with just the fact that we know that there are things beyond our control that may need to be compensated for us but that we don't squeeze our arteries I think we need to just kind of level some of the prospecting so that we don't go well sorry boss measure a bite because actually not not working on the global scale we're gonna wind up killing our our our field and I think that that largely depends on the health of the of the company to begin with the company that's well-placed and then just nobody I'm telling you I'm we're working with people that working in casinos in Macau which was the biggest profit margin in planet yeah and that's that artery has been constricted instantly so with the web sitting now it's it's there's a there's a difference between a reality check and a rule this now beyond the reality just as a rude awakening but we need to help you take it on differently and I don't like to talk about casinos in Macau I've also I come from culture but they that's why I use the artery metaphor so depending on the artery the size of our your capillaries it's a circulatory I think we need to really look at what we're doing here thank you I need to support them too I agree Vincent did you want to add to that yeah I think as a developer of tours for companies it's quite profiling because if things go on and honestly I'm worried for one country very much its USA USA it doesn't have a real public system so they are not in the ability to cope with what's going to happen your president is just showing not the things not to do not being tested but especially that they're not able they won't be able to cope because it's as as our friend Nikki it's Nikki I said it's a private sector and it's not for common good it's for profit so I'm very very worried for for that sector of the world that USA is gonna hit and it's gonna get hard and it's going to take a long time before things get better luckily from all the what I read is that in summer with the warmth the virus don't stand the warm so well no we don't know ah but so Edinburgh is the fit of a fringe Ladenburg is very important the mantra complete mistake is important the Aveeno is very important for all those companies to to be able to set tours for the upcoming years so what's going to happen is really worrying because because the company will need to work in one year from now and after their shows on the road i so that that's very preoccupied well so I just touch word cross fingers and try to find solutions to be able to to present our shows to to be able to have those shows on the road in a year or two from now on oh yeah Vincent thank you that's a very good point about how fragile this whole system is depending on the Sun the spring and summer markets and Vicky's next but I just wanted to mention that Matthew said in the chat and I think this is a good point that Australia it's summer there right now right Deb and we're still experiencing the health problems from the Cova 19 so whether or not it slows down still remains to be seen but that's not a good sign Viki you're up yeah I was I was gonna say that one of the things that this virus is exposed is problems that existed in our system before the virus that now have come to into sharp focus because we're having to deal with them on a really really large scale so the idea of course bishal in contracts in in UK force majeure comes into existing agreements and it's really coming into play that for shows are already running and failure to produce which is another clause that deals with things that are in production agreements that are yet to be made it's really clear that there is a real imbalance in where the risk sits and quite often that risk sits with touring companies and independent artists one of the things that equity is looking at in the short term and in the long term I guess is how it can redesign that its existing contracts so that that risk is something that is more shared and doesn't fall to the what is normally the weakest link to deal with venues and producers and and funding sources so for example at the moment and you know if you're a producer and you're running a show in the UK at them and do you have force majeure in your contracts you know a contract will deal with clauses that the producer that is under the control of the producer and things that are not within the control that's producer so force majeure at the moment is not really within the control of the producer you don't have any any influence over what happens with the coronavirus what happens we government legislation so for a lot of producers that means that they can step away from contracts with minimal recourse to the artists that they've engaged and lots of your problem I see your point Thank You Stefan I'm sorry I jumped over you it's your turn no problem so I'm just gonna be a little bit provocative because I'm just like to have fun with this and you're French with being and I'm French I'm allowed right so and also I'm very bad with you know having a conversation without having a beer actually so I cannot just talk like this so as some of you pointed out yes I agree it's an opportunity and I think it's funny that we're having this opportunity because were forced to have it thanks to a virus but we might be forced in the future to have this kind of opportunity for other reasons like I don't know maybe climate change and for me it goes beyond rethinking how what we do and yeah it's all very nice the online 3d printing whatever you want I would like to push the rethinking a little bit further and maybe we should rethink the whole system and all capitalistic system around this and the work processes and I mean I don't want to say hashtag destroy capitalism but it's a bit where I'm going with this I think there's gonna be a definitely a specific impact for circus because it has a specific because it has specificities and I believe and I hope that circus will have specific reactions as well however we need to have a common response between the performing arts and also largely between other sectors and the one thing that strikes me is that one of the specificities is that circuses very much international so this issue and the fact that is international and the fact that mobility is hindered right now shows how fragile the whole thing is so that's what I'm interested in and see how we can counterbalance this as let's say as a as a test because this will probably happen in the future and you know so we have events for instance in April and I'm said to say yes I don't want to say it's canceled I want to say I'm gonna transform this event I'm gonna give you the content this is gonna be a capacity-building opportunity it's just gonna be different and I'm gonna try to learn new skills and share new skills but I also try to show I think what is important right now instead of having conversation about how the virus spread and you know I am I mean I trust the medical authorities in at least in my countries to tell me to give me medical information because I'm not a doctor that is to show solidarity and also to give concrete solidarity opportunities to the people we know so that's what I'm interested in right now thank you that's a very very good point about trying to still deliver in a new way and I think that you know you're by working together by being international and by communicating opportunities we might be able to still salvage some spring and summer things I don't know I'm hoping I know Nicky did you want to add something you were on anyone because some of those points but you really put it in a whole system's context better than I probably would have but I was going to bring up the point of climate change as like connected to these questions around touring you know we're talking about picking up touring but then there's also the consideration of you know while we're at it remembering and right that travel you know gas emissions these things could significantly change in the next 10 to 15 years and what you know if we are going to be talking about infrastructure you know there's I think in line with these economic questions and their artistic questions also are the questions around how can we how can we create strong local you know systems that are prepared to be adaptable to these additional changes that we know we can anticipate that will make that sort of 20th century model not relevant anymore you know I think that's a really real factor when we're talking about infrastructure not just talking about sanitizing stuff but also you know what are the other things that we can recognize will be different going forward from here and how can we engage with those so that's all I was gonna add to that are we going to become hyper local as far as the arts performing arts are we going to use technology will that reduce the effect of an art because as we know it's not the same as being there in person is that just something that we'll have to adapt to those are the questions yeah did anyone else want to add anything Matthew and then Veronica yeah I also had the look of misspending about 25 years of my life on door and the it's not Tupperware you've come in with a Tupperware you take off the lid you put people in and then you go somewhere I think what what Nikki's talking about is an interesting way of looking at it I know that there's a great deal of a local interface with many of the doors that we do from staffing and also from a lot of other things and if there were more forward-thinking in terms of the logical aspect as well and also just the cultural contagion in a positive way there are a lot of local infrastructures that exist that can be solicited locally without bring it as an imported product of course you master it differently there's more planning there's a huge amount of logistic conditions to be taken on in terms of that but personally I've actually engaged very often and not for financial gain local artists every single time I come in to do and a lot of cross-pollination culturally as opposed to just coming in and selling tickets which as the suitors today is very easy to do yeah I got the brand and people come in and buy tickets and then you leave but there's a great deal of interface there and actually have with that touring tool have been able to stimulate a great deal of cross-pollination and a great deal of growth within certain local ideas I think some of the philosophy around touring is they come in as an itinerant art rather than coming in and just planting your stuff like I say the type of where you just take off the lid put some people in it walk away with some cash and I think that there is something to be developed amongst ourselves to make that as a proposition rather than just philosophical suggestion yeah Veronica is one very quickly Thank You Stefan for the topic you opened you open another hundred questions and I don't have any answers I just would like to add to this throwing thing and international let's say principled circus without touring and as going abroad there would be no contrary circus in the Czech Republic and we still need to travel we still need us and our people at grow so they can study and bring the circus back into our country so this is also a huge question or the future just want to go edit this this is a very good point it's not as simple as just putting everything online obviously but at the moment this is where we're at just brainstorming these ideas I think this is a conversation that will continue offline and online and hopefully we'll have an opportunity to do a follow-up report but first I want to thank everyone for spending the time with us today and talking to us about your sector and I hope we have a chance to follow up with you soon every resource that you've shared with us in this conversation please send me a message of it so we can put it in our post so everyone has access to it and I just want to say thank you so much everyone it's been a great conversation", "5GroL1T9ZQA": "[Applause] tonight where we are now is gotta be considered a more dangerous place than we've ever been in before everyone should be treated with dignity and fairness and decency you don't always get like a date I haven't had a date for the past two years Irish citizens are flying home from around the world to vote on a referendum tomorrow that could overturn one of the strictest abortion bans anywhere Ireland's eighth

between the anti-establishment five-star movement and the far-right league that's promised billions in tax cuts and increases to welfare spending eight women have accused Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment according to a CNN report Freeman said today he apologizes to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected and Harvey Weinstein is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement on Friday to face sexual misconduct charges from one of his accusers president Trump's twenty20 campaign has already raised more than 40 million dollars before any major Democratic candidate has even raised a dime Trump also got a head start given that he filed his reelection paperwork the week he was inaugurated Airmen who provides security at a nuclear missile base in Wyoming got caught dropping acid on their days off according to documents from 2016 obtained by the AAP it's a good reminder that while nuclear weapons are incredibly deadly guarding them in the middle of nowhere is incredibly boring the president said he canceled the big summit with North Korea today because Kim was being rude but if it was really about insults this whole thing would have fallen apart long before now this maniac fire and fury rocket man is on a suicide mission [Music] that ongoing food fight was actually starting to feel normal until the summit breakthrough then the day taht started to feel normal until today's Twitter rule but the announcement wasn't totally out of the blue just a couple days ago Trump warns the June 12th date might not hold we will see but still it was a pretty jarring turn of events this morning we woke up to news that North Korea had blown up his nuclear testing facilities there's a few hours later later the White House said Trump dictated himself the summit was cancelled or maybe it wasn't it's possible that the existing summit could take place or a summit at some later date nobody should be anxious we have to get it right there's a lot to be puzzled about in terms of strategy and process South Korean officials have been deeply involved but they said they were blindsided by today's news one emerging explanation for what's going on here is that the foundation for these high-level talks just wasn't coming together in a hearing this morning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the only American to actually meet with Kim so far said the US was prepared but that North Korea wasn't over the past many days we have endeavored to do what chairman Kim and I had agreed was to put teams preparation teams together to begin to work to prepare for the summit and we had received no response to our inquiries from them so now what are things back to square one or is it just other part of a diplomatic dance I spoke to ambassador Robert Gallucci who served as chief US negotiator with North Korea back during the 1994 nuclear crisis anybody who has watched diplomacy at all noted that this thing was upside down or cart before the horse so or whatever that you don't start with a summit and and then you have detailed negotiations to work out how actually things are going to work in the engineering of a deal that where the physics is done by the leadership that's we I don't know of any other case where that was their proposed course and all of us said well this is unusual this letter today the president sent to North Korea you characterized that letter do you feel like it's a negotiation tactic by the president first of all reading the letter I had the fear that he actually wrote it which is to say that the syntax the the way it's framed including the threat about nuclear weapons but also the possibility reversing everything he said in the upper paragraphs in a heartbeat if you'd like to which is a standard apparently that the president has of saying well we'll you know we'll go and it'll work or it won't work I don't know let's wait and see if there's a reason why I think diplomats talk the way they do when they're dealing with things other than fishing rights when you're dealing with nuclear weapons programs and that I think you really work at moderation that doesn't mean that if the other side raises the temperature you don't go up with it to demonstrate you're prepared to I understand that but that's not where you want to be we have never had a president who talked so easily about the use of nuclear weapons it makes some of us wonder whether he's really looked at the magnitude of destruction overall do you feel like that we've turned a corner with North Korea I mean people were afraid of actual armed conflict do you think that the fact of seeing this summit fall apart does that put that back on the table or is that just old news now the bad news today unambiguous bad news is that the summit being off means that we will not find out whether the nuclear crisis over North Korea's capability to strike the United States with ICBMs armed with thermonuclear weapons can be ended that that's the bad news [Music] today President Trump awarded the Medal of Honor to former Navy SEAL Brits lubinski for his bravery in the Battle of Robert's Ridge in Afghanistan in 2002 while leading a rescue mission to save a fellow SEAL who'd fallen from a helicopter lubinski and his team came under heavy fire from Taliban fighters he ordered an evacuation and led his men to safety during a 14-hour fight but the story of what happened that day may be more complicated than the metal citation makes it sound the Air Force has recommended another member of slabin skis team for a Medal of Honor Air Force technical sergeant John Chapman Chapman was wounded just minutes into the battle and was left behind when slab in ski thinking Chapman was dead ordered the SEAL team to evacuate but in 2016 the Air Force collected video evidence that showed Chapman wasn't dead and then he fought off Taliban fighters alone for an hour until he was fatally shot in the chest some Esteli a friend of chapman and a fellow Air Force veteran wasn't there that day but he studied footage and other evidence of what happened all the evidence shows the Japanese came conscious and he commenced to wreaking havoc on all the Taliban that were in his immediate area about an hour and a half longer Tedeschi look comes in when the Taliban start shooting at the helicopter he knew that was just back there so he stands up he calls that at home and just to engage and that's to make it even chest that sounds like Medal of Honor worthy heroism but according to allegations first reported in Newsweek Navy and Special Operations Command brass tried to prevent Chapman from getting his metal because accepting the air force's version of events would mean slab insky violated even if unintentionally a cardinal rule never leave a teammate behind nobody is continuing Stravinsky's for making that decision it's very hurtful that anyone would ever try and block Chevys accommodation because it's chattin don't deserve name of honor nobody deserves Doug sterner a veteran and expert on military awards says this level of infighting is pretty much unprecedented in the history of the Medal of Honor I've never seen anything like this inter-service rivalry you know it's how hung up all over the awards that I wish did not exist I believe the Brits lubinski on that hillside did his job the best way that he could and if mistakes were made those mistakes take nothing away from the heroism that he demonstrated lubinski himself maintains that while he believed Chapman to be dead it would have been in Chapman's character to continue fighting and he said in the past that Chapman deserves the highest honors and while Chapman is expected to receive a posthumous Medal of Honor at some point it's still not clear if he'll be recognized for what he did after slab insky left him for dead [Music] this is informed choices one of thousands of pro-life crisis pregnancy centers or CPCs in the country they provide free health services to pregnant women but they don't offer abortion this is the first time they've allowed cameras inside their facility if you turn this way I wanted to point at our promise this is something that our patients receive we're going to treat you with respect we will not pressure you we will support you and we will not lie to you you know the we will not lie to you bit like why did that come about tell me about that you know because I think there's a very untrue narrative that says oh don't go to a center like that because they're going to lie to you I can absolutely say that's not who we are we exist to help women imagine the possibilities of life let's now go into our examination room so if the woman comes in she she's pregnant when she decides that she wants to terminate that pregnancy what happens in that moment in in fortresses I mean when they were were absolutely clear about is that every woman has three choices and every woman can choose to end her pregnancy to a parent or to replace her child for adoption those are the rights that we have in America but the state of California says cpc's frequently mislead women about what services they provide that's why the state passed the 2015 fact Act requiring licensed cpc's like informed choices to post signs that tell women they can get access to low-cost or free health services from the state including abortion but cpc's don't think they should be forced to post those signs and have challenged the law in the Supreme Court which is set to rule on the case any day now I think for a lot of people the idea of you putting up a sign that just says hey we don't provide abortions here but if you do want to look for that the state of California can offer you some other options what is the fundamental problem you have with the idea of putting a sign up there well my fundamental problem really has nothing to do with abortion it has to do with free speech essentially we are being required to use the walls of our pregnancy clinic as advertising for the abortion industry and I have a real problem with that but when I do called abortion Guillory California Planned Parenthood came up as number one that informed choices came up as number two you guys don't provide abortions no but we provide abortion information but one of the things that I think that your detractors say is that women who might be actually seeking an abortion service think that they could go to this kind of facility to actually receive and of course the way we mitigate that is to be very clear on our website as well as on the information again our reception area it says very clearly that we do not refer or perform abortion but Assemblyman David Chiu I wrote the facts acts based in part on reports from an abortion rights advocacy group want CPCs to do more crisis pregnancy center is a fake health center that purports to provide pregnant women who are in need of information services that assist them when they're pregnant but in reality they're run by extreme activists who are providing lies and misinformation they will tell you that if you consider an abortion you'll get breast cancer you will become severely depressed you'll never be able to have children again you may become suicidal why not just take away their licenses I mean if they are perpetuating this kind of fraud or give you medical misinformation why does the state of California continue to provide them with medical licenses well these clinics do provide some services but our laws very simple it simply says you need to provide a one or two line notice to someone who's walking in the door about whether facility is licensed or if it is licensed what kind of services are available in California that's it now it's up to the supreme courts to decide if that's legal there is precedent for the California law in some states the government already compels speech about abortion three states require doctors to describe ultrasound images to women before they can get an abortion others demand a discussion about adoption before a woman can end her pregnancy it was a point Justice Breyer brought up of the Supreme Court oral arguments back in March if a pro-life state Candell a doctor you have to tell people about adoption why can't a pro-choice state tell a doctor a facility of whatever it is you have to tell people about abortion despite justice Breyers comments court Watchers think there's a good chance the justices will rule in favor of cpc's so they won't have to post signs about abortions but ironically if the CPC side does win the fight in California they could end up losing those anti-abortion games they've made in other states so are you hoping in a way that you'll all get struck down it's been pointed out that we might be winning either way if the California law gets struck down it opens up the door for constitutional challenges for all of those laws in all of those other states so you've probably been getting a lot of these emails lately why because of gdpr a new European data law that goes into effect May 25th the law covers EU citizens but could have broader implications gdpr was designed to give quote data subjects more commonly known as people new rights and greater control over their personal data for instance you will now have the right to move your data to a different social network or have your personal information completely erased companies will also be required to notify users within 72 hours of a data breach and rule breakers will face steep fines if you're a fan of transparency all of this is good news but there's one part of the gdpr that tech companies will fight tooth and nail a section that's been referred to as the right to explanation basically it would require companies to tell users what data was used in how it was computed by an algorithm the gdpr specifically mentions automated decisions on job applications and credit applications but in theory it could apply to any algorithm that has a quote significant effect on a user's life like a facebook ad for example you would need to make an argument that this ad is affecting you in a significant way so for example if job ads are being shown to you this could actually be affecting your life just what constitutes a significant effect will play out in EU courts that means Google or Facebook might have to unveil have certain algorithms that they based their businesses on work these algorithms have enabled tech companies to make billions of dollars that's why tech companies have always refused to disclose their inner workings which they considered trade secrets but with gdpr they might not have a choice West Hollywood is exactly the place you'd expect to proclaim a day to be stormy Daniels Day and hand over a shiny key to the city in front of Chi Chi LaRue's adult boutique the community of West Hollywood was founded more than three decades ago on the principle that everyone should be treated with dignity and fairness and decency everywhere you look there are signs of the city's resistance to President Donald Trump stormy Daniels day in the city of Weston so we've been fighting this fight and along came this unlikely heroine you know in the profile we Carolyn I consider a heroine we're not giving her an award for being a porn star I've never seen her movies on a game ad never seen her movie so I don't really know we're giving her this presentation but she's taken on the Trump administration we have somebody helping us in the fight so Wednesday stormy Daniels porn star porn director self-proclaimed adulterer and plaintiff was the queen of the resistance you just don't think it's a little ridiculous to give her the key to the city I think it's amazing because I think what other city in the United States would that happen for some people she is the perfect counterpoint to the president I don't judge her for what she's done in her work or on camera or anything I judge her for standing up to I believe the biggest bully this mini coronation of Daniels means America is a different place than say the late 90s when another woman who messed around with a president became not only a punchline but a pariah why do you think we live in a world where squirming Daniel's pornstar but also adulterer is being upheld and Monica Lewinsky back then was basically run out of town I think if Monica did what she did back then but now it would be a really different story and I think that you know she would probably end up being part of the me2 movement because she'd be like hey I was an entire novice to do this shitty thing to me Trump hasn't only altered the political game whether he meant to or not he's helped push this country in a direction where women with famous first names aren't just a punchline they can make money off their stories sell t-shirts and smile as they own their little corner of history I never thought I would have a prom I never thought I would get to really experience that we don't dance normally most of us we all look ridiculous go find somebody if you find me come dance with me I will love you we are looking at pictures from past proms this is you know that classic dad's gonna kill the date picture this is one of the ones we printed it out to enter me for Miss Photogenic Huntsville I actually won Miss Photogenic of Huntsville but then I won national title for best smile Sydney would get in trouble at school up because she's very social and she would just get up and walk around the classroom and once we pulled her out of school and she had nobody to talk to for a little while we found out she's really smart the biggest challenge with homeschooling is that I am a very social person so the only social that I get is through extracurricular activities dance musical theatre Boy Scouts it's a venturing program that is co-ed or actually prom [Music] this year's theme was whispers of the sea which was a nautical theme punk underwater experience I am the president of timeless home school events in Huntsville homeschool prom is one of our events that we put on yearly right but you are loved in action for being here and giving your time the first thing that we're gonna ask you guys to do is to sign our core value sheet we're saying regardless of any child's orientation gender their color that we love them as they are we take prom very seriously a lot of home schoolers they don't have the opportunity to have dances this is so these kids could be here smiling laughing and they will just have a fabulous time I'm excited that it's my senior prom and I'm very excited to go with my boyfriend at the moment I think it's gonna be a lot of fun they've been dating for a few months now and I love Dean he's a great kid he's very extra person you know those theater kids yeah he is one yeah we're not really going anywhere nice for dinner we're really just going to chick-fil-a we really wanted to get prom pictures with the cow then after that we're gonna go to prom we have people all the way from Mississippi Georgia Florida will come to this prom we'll have a lot of fun [Music] that is that time to all seniors to the dance floor with your daily time to dance [Music] I realized I didn't have a date and so I messaged Preston on snapchat and said hey will you go to prom with me and he said okay so I asked him know prom she thought she was clever with a prom son yeah I made a promposal and it said so he's gonna be a Marine and I said before you report for duty come to prom and shake your booty cuz I thought I was so funny you don't always get like a date I haven't had a day for the past two years and it's a different experience each time so you have to take it by fly by the seat of your pants you can be left out of your friend sometimes it just kind of happens yeah where you're on your own for a while but it still turned out great a great experience and I enjoyed every moment of it when I met her she was very kind to me she did my hair for a show that we did she made jokes of me she made me feel comfortable around her so when she joined the show that I told her hey auditions are tomorrow and she showed to the first rehearsal late but she still looked awesome here in her Boy Scout uniform I thought to myself I might want to try it was surreal to me that a girl so pretty the national best smile so kind would say yes someone like me I took a shower that night and I was just just water fell on my face I never know why I said yes I just kind of said yeah sure we

night clinic financial clinic clinic clinic tonight bishops james akuma is my name so glad you could take the time to hook up with me today question is what's your relationship with money everybody has a relationship with money but what kind of a relationship do you have with money one of the things many of us don't realize is that we have a money personality we have a particular mindset we have towards money and it determines our relationship with money interesting i was asking people earlier on on my radio show what's the first thought that comes to mind when you hear the word money and the sms's are very interesting phyllis nongo all the way from saudi arabia for her she says the first when she has money first thought is my children she thinks about her children it is two people texted it and said the first thought that comes to mind when they hear the word money is it's never enough of somebody else who's texted in today and they say when they hear money the first thought is money is the the love of money is the root of all evil moses in qatar uh says when he hears the word money first thing that comes to mind is budget for me when i hear the word money the first thing that comes to mind is freedom money mindset you know growing up i i i keep sharing this story uh when i talk about money growing up you know uh when i was in high school going into college uh my dad had uh left his job and so he had relocated back to uh geshagi so my mom was raising us up they were coordinating in between and i remember one of the things my mom loved saying whenever you would ask my mom for money and my mom is watching see how you have affected my thought processes where money is concerned my mother my mom would always first thing she would say whenever you would ask her for money she would say she would say should i have it even if she was played that day and you asked her for something her first thought was i don't have it i don't have it hakuna pizza even if she would give you later her first reaction would be akuna pesa you know and i kind of picked that from her and i remember one time we were in the supermarket you know when my first born was still a young boy and he asked for something and i shouted hapuna pesa and i thought oh my goodness that is not me speaking that is my mother speaking through me and that's the time i began to understand processes about money mindsets about money what are your thoughts towards money what have you believed about money because those things affect how you relate to money that's what we're going to be talking about today of an amazing guest i will be introducing her to you in the next short while question still goes out to you those on radio have been answering if you're joining us on tv tell me when you hear the word money what is the first thought that comes to your mind share that with me on 20316 sms whatsapp zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen it is mambo na clinic financial clinic today we're talking about money mindsets and how to develop the right money mindset i'm asking you the question what's the first thought that comes to mind when you hear the word money maureen in kisumu you say when you hear money you think of shopping i like that one i like that one i have more messages coming in ruth you say my father inducted in me to think money pango hence budget don't touch it until you have a plan for it i think that's a good thought lynette in nairobi for you you say when you hear money a smile comes on your face you think of happiness and stability okay that's good that's good that's good this morning i have an amazing guest for us today as we discuss many mindsets uh joining us via zoom uh we have nungari mugi irenge nungari is a mentor and uh she is excited to be here today how are you doing i'm doing well thank you karimusana you hear the different things people are thinking about when they hear money some are thinking shopping some are thinking budgeting they just think of their children they hear money and they think children that is very interesting i'm listening to them and i really like that from the shopper yes she seems to be my favorite one [Laughter] oh my goodness so when we talk about money mindsets what what are we talking about really we're talking about how people think about money what you know what the attitude towards finances really is what we're talking about and so most people really they're just two mindsets there's the negative and the positive it just falls into different you know it has different um manifestations but really it's either you have a positive mindset towards money or a negative mindset towards money but how it shows up in your life is different okay so i i would say like the lady who's the shopper yeah her mindset is the yellow mindset you know you only live once today we eat and drink for tomorrow we die you see those people all the time yes yes saving and investing is not in the plan you know once they get money they want to enjoy it they want to go on holiday that's when they call out the girls and the boys and they're having a good old time but at the end of the day they are also very stressed because when they actually need money or if they go through a job loss or something like that yeah they find that they have nothing you know they lived for today and that was the end of that so that yellow mindset it's you know it's good for the moment because you're having fun but beyond that it's not good for you at all it's actually a negative money mindset wow very interesting i'm just wondering where do these mindsets come from are we born with them or do they develop over time no when we're born we're just a blank slate we're just a blank slate and life gets to right on the slate you know and sometimes we learn based on what we saw our parents doing if your parents were extremely frugal yes they said everything you might go their way or you might rebel against their way and become a yellow type of person because you saw how how that affected you in a negative way so mainly it's the experiences of life that teach us how to think through things yes um or how we saw other people doing things and we choose to either go the same way or to go a different way ah so as a parent i need to be aware that my relationship with money and my conversations around money and my spending habits are affecting the kind of relationship my children will have with money you're writing on the blank slate and you're the first person that ever writes on that slate as a parent okay so whatever you're doing with money what you're demonstrating about money what you're saying about money what you're teaching about money in your home and sometimes we teach without really saying anything you're communicating either way and your children are picking up out of that and unfortunately in most of you know the african society uh we're very secretive about our money about our finances oh yeah yeah so the dad doesn't really get to say what's going on he never demonstrates how to budget he never demonstrates how to save he's just doing his own thing in secret and so the children never really learn how to deal with money they kind of just develop their own lifestyle and their own way of doing it yes and that can be dangerous you know you say that and and i'm thinking you know even our parents never really showed us how they made their money let alone telling us how much they make you know they never showed us this is how uh i make money this is how i'm able to pay my bills yes you know your dad woke up in the morning he went to work i remember my father was a government worker yeah he retired at the age of 55 earning 8 000 kenya shillings what but he but yes but he was he had built houses he had built rental units how did he how did 8 000 build rents or units it doesn't make any sense but i have no clue what he did and that is what we do most of us do so your children are seeing a manifestation but they have no idea how it came about yeah yeah and we need to become more deliberate in teaching our children how to handle money wow you know you say that i'm i'm also reminded of something that was quite common with with our parents generation that would communicate to ask their children that this is my money you go and make your own you know and they would not tell us how they made their money how they manage their money they would just say and i'm thinking if i don't get a job does it mean i can't get money you know right yeah in fact we were raised with the idea that the education would lead you to a good job yes that would then lead you to finances but the current reality does not even yambatani there's nothing about that that is making sense we have too many graduates out here they have good degrees good papers yeah and no jobs very true and so what is important now is wisdom what the world would call strict smarts but we call it wisdom because god can give you wisdom for the marketplace and that is what we need to tap into more than really our education education is good it's excellent i'm planning to educate my children to the highest level that they will go yeah but really if they can tap into the wisdom of god for the marketplace they will do better very true how yeah how important is it for me as an individual to know the kind of money mindset i have because i figure a lot of people don't even think about it they don't even know so how important is it to know your money mindset is everything it really is everything you know romans 12 2 tells us that we need to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and unless you renew your mind you will keep doing the same things that you are doing you will keep going the same way that you are going you will keep getting the same results that you are getting so you have to renew your mind and as a believer i think the best way to renew your mind is to read your bible because the bible is rich with wisdom from god on how to survive how to thrive in the marketplace and also so that you can know your relationship with god and how that plugs you into heavenly health for the economic you know for what you do out there so you don't need to do business on your own you have help from heaven god will help you but if you don't think that way if you're always thinking it's got to be me it's me and the grind i wake up running i'm off to hustle i'm off it's a struggle already you're in a negative place mentally you're in a negative place so why not first get into a positive place where you know i am helped god will help me he has promised that he will give me wealth he will prosper me he will make me successful and then go out to that oomph coming from heaven and that gives you a more positive attitude towards money and once you learn how to relate positively with money because money shouldn't control you you should control money yeah yeah people care areas i cannot allow them to sleep in the same house with one thousand children [Laughter] and you are there one of you must take people [Laughter] i know such people i know such people you know you know yesterday i was having a conversation with a friend of mine on just the whole subject of money there's something you've said that has triggered that thought you know god has said he will bless us and all that and he was saying party sometimes me i i wonder you know because god has promised us this but it seems like those who are not born again are the ones who are prospering you know those who don't know god those who are not serving him are the ones who have the money they are the ones who have all these things and as believers we are just here you know life is just hard did god lie to us what's the problem you know it's like he's been waiting for god to i don't know whether he was waiting for god to drop down like a safe full of money from heaven good dish you know there you go my son have merry and enjoy where's the disconnect you know that that is a common a common thing that i hear all the time and i have come to understand that most of the people who are struggling with this issue really they do not have an understanding of what the word of god says oh they do not understand that they have a covenant with god that god will prosper them that not only does he want to prosper he wants to give you a surplus of prosperity yes and then they do not understand that there is a way you do things in the kingdom of god you say we get saved we are in the world not of the world but we want to continue in the world as if we are in the world can you imagine a believer who wants to get a tender through bribing yes and they tell you if it was a black bride so i have to bribe now you are in the kingdom of god the devil is your enemy but you have gone to use the devil system to make money will he prosper you no so you have to use kingdom principles to prosper in the marketplace but most believers do not even know what those principles are unfortunately wow and they are all in the word of god so it is our own ignorance we are ignorant yeah and we are perishing for lack of knowledge and if we only knew once you begin to understand how the kingdom works financially you just most people just begin to thrive and to prosper and they discover it wasn't the way they thought i'm just wondering god doesn't lie yes i'm wondering that that that christian that believer who goes out to bribe to get this tender what kind of mindset would you say they have towards money i think they're in a place where they have no understanding of their relationship with god really that's what it is they may be ambitious they may be diligent in their work they may be go-getters they may be through goal you know they may do they may be doing all the right things but they're getting frustrated because they're trying to use the demonic system to get money and it doesn't work when you're in the kingdom of god you see that will work for those in the kingdom of darkness because it is their it is their system that's how they make money but in the kingdom we don't do it that way so once you try to tap into the devil's thing yes to get success it doesn't work it doesn't work so they need to come into a place where they understand god's way of doing things and once they get that and they line up with god it's easier it becomes easier god opens those for you you see the bible says in isaiah 45 i will go before you i will break down those gates of iron i will cast asunder the bars that keep you bad outside i will open the gates for you that i may give to you the secret treasures in hidden places that is wealth but you have to be helped by god if you are doing it in your own effort i have to bribe i have to know somebody i have to work my networks i have to do this i have to do that you're using the other side it doesn't really work he did it to move his agenda forward okay shortly we'll talk about then what is the right money mindset you know as we look at the according to the word of god and how do we develop into that kind of a mindset i'm giving you an opportunity to ask questions this morning 20316 is the sms line and the whatsapp number zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen we're talking about the right money mindset whatever lisa massoi you have the opportunity my pastor pastor daniel how are you doing and kenneth o'ma is your driver kenneth um how are you doing thank you for carrying my pastor this morning you guys are tuned in and listening may the lord bless you i'm still getting sms's different people telling me the first thing that comes to mind when they hear money one here says i think of investment tithing and family three things come to mind when this gentleman hears about money and then betty you see first thought that comes when you hear the word money or mosquito hairy oh my goodness keep sending in those sms's today we are hanging out with nungari who's a mentor and she's helping us to gain a deeper understanding of money mindsets and the right mindsets we should have in regards to money so let's go there let's go there what what is the right mindset towards money does the word of god have anything to say about this issue i think the right the right mindset is what i call i would call it a wealthy mindset and a wealthy mindset comes from the word of god because when you read deuteronomy 8 18 you see that it is god who gives us the power to create wealth yes you know he gives it to us and it's a promise and it is something you receive there somewhere you receive salvation by faith you receive wealth by faith and that ability to create wealth by faith this life is by faith without faith we cannot please god yes it's as simple as understanding and believing that god has he has a desire for me to make money and that is and that money is good because there are some people who think money is evil very true you know they must go to the bible instead of saying the love of money which is greed it's greed and avarice where you make money an idol to you that is what is the root of all you it is not money money takes the character of the person who has it if you are a liberal person yeah money will be evil in your hands yeah but if you are a righteous and good person then money will be beneficial in your hand and that is why god wants us to have money because as long as you are in the kingdom of god and you are truly born again in the interests of the father are your interests then in your hands money becomes a good thing so it is having that wealthy mindset i love what you're sharing because i find that for a good number of believers the issue of money is a struggle it's like we want it it's like we want it but we don't want it you know it's like we want it but uh people will start thinking i've joined the illuminati you know all these kinds of things we say you know some of us have believed it is not possible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom you know it is easier for the camel to go through the eye of the needle yeah so that scripture and the one that the one we misquote man is the root of all evil those two scriptures become the guiding point of our lives and so we have we have a brand of christians who believe that uh poverty equals humility and it equals godliness and i'm thinking like how twisted can you get you know when you say that you render the work of christ what he did on calvary powerless because second corinthians 8 9 says that though he was rich for your sake for your sake you who is listening for your sake he became poor and that means he became beggarly he was wealthy and he became beggar so that you through his beggarliness his poverty you might become rich a love word rich that means wealthy it means wealthy money so calvary part of the package of salvation was wealth for the children of god jesus came here left his will became poor for you so that you may become rich once you understand that you stop getting conflicted and i can understand that conflict and it comes from being you know a misinterpretation yeah of those verses you see if money has you remember the story of the rich young man he came to jesus he said i keep all the commandments everything else i have done right jesus said to him go give away everything you have come back and follow me he went away very sad we are told he we didn't see anywhere he came back because manny had his heart yeah it is hard it is very difficult for the rich the ones who who the ones who have given their hearts to money to enter the kingdom of god how will they enter but if you have a right relationship with money and that is key a right relationship with money money will not affect your salvation he will go to heaven just fine father abraham was very rich isaac his son was richard jacob was ridiculous joseph was insane [Laughter] and we will meet them there from one glory to another from one glory to the next in fact they would you see abraham made all his money gave it all to isaac isaac built on it it became even more handed it over to his son jacob got the bulk of it because he got the double inheritance yes he went and built on it then they went to eat it where things just went nuts because while all the egyptians were selling themselves for food joseph was feeding them for free yes they lost nothing and so they were just prospering and growing by the time the famine ended they were the ones who were the mughals in egypt buying up all the food doing all the trade they were so rich pero panicked he said these people are ridiculously rich they're too powerful for us let us do something about this yes so money in the hands of the people of god is a good thing it is part of our covenant he told abraham i will bless you so you can become a blessing and blessing we quote this all the time proverbs 10 22 that the blessing of the lord makes rich and adds no sorrow and adds no sorrow to it you see rich is wealthy that's what it means it doesn't have a hidden meaning it just means wealthy rich pesticide money you know and it adds no sorrow to it sorrow means painful toil so you're not supposed to be toiling painfully for money it shouldn't cost you sorrow it shouldn't cost you mental stress and it shouldn't cause your family to scatter it should be a blessing to you and your people and then you are meant to be a blessing to others with that money now that is the right mindset that we are supposed to be having about finance wow how do i get there how do i get there i think that's the challenge for a lot of believers the word of the lord will renew the mind the word of the lord everything i'm saying is in the word of god unfortunately james and i don't know if you've noticed this believers have a challenge with reading the bible yes that is true they're not they won't read it and so they are class they're ignorant and they're perishing for lack of knowledge if they will only read the word of god with an open heart and an open mind and ask the holy spirit who's supposed to be the teacher they just tell him teach me show me david said show me wonderful things in your law open my eyes to see and once you begin to see you your life is transformed because you get it you understand you begin to receive it and to claim it as a promise from the father you begin to go out with that you know that excitement knowing that god is backing you up you begin to talk to everything jesus would speak to trees he spoke to the fig tree the thing dried up in 24 hours start to talk to your business in the mighty name of jesus you shall prosper i am prospering today this is the day call your clients you know sometimes you have to be a little bit on the insane side okay stand up and call them i call my customers today from the four winds of the air come you will be surprised who will find you on facebook even from iceland or alaska and watch what you are selling so just get radical about it believe god get radical about it and go for it i'm just wondering did you always have the right money mindset or is this something you had to learn and if it's something you had to learn how did it change your life you know i had to learn it obviously i started like everybody else i was a go-getter i was very ambitious you know i went out and i got a really good job and just by the grace of god i learned how to speak the right things and to have the right attitude and to go for what i needed in life and so at the end of in my 20s i was making a six-figure salary a single girl cruising around in a nice car i was a yellow lifer yes that's why i like the shopper i understand that you know i would go on holiday when i wanted that go for a staycation in nevada when i wanted and then i lost my job oh and i had nothing wow and then i had to grow up yes and i had to look in the word of the lord because i would read the word and i would tell god this promise you have said here that you will give me abundant prosperity is a lie i will tell you this is a lie and god would correct me and show me no you are the one who messed it up like this and so i began to grow and i began to learn and i understood that there's a spiritual aspect of money yeah and then there is the financial management i have to be a good steward of money and that is another thing believers do not really want to hear but you must be a good steward wow from the two sides the spiritual aspect of money and the and the stewardship side of money where do you think as believers we are lacking the most in all honesty i think we lack more in the spiritual side okay we really do not have an understanding of our covenant with god we've heard a lot about saving and budgeting we have an idea yeah of saving you know budgeting and what we should do on that end but this at the end we we are not really even conversant what we like in the financial management for most people is not knowledge yeah it is discipline uh-huh okay you see yeah but in the spiritual side we lack knowledge entirely we're just clueless and that is doing us more harm than good wow you know one time i attended this financial class and one of the things that we were told that i've never forgotten maybe you can share a bit on this we were told never be emotional about money yes because the moment you start being emotional around money that is when you begin to mess up money has no emotions towards you have no emotions towards it is that is that is that a good principle that is a very good principle because you see this is that that becomes a question of emotional intelligence around finances oh you see and that is why you notice that the people who have cared a person they can't sleep with a thou in the house yeah that is a lack of emotional just not intelligence in that department and then there's another group of people when they get money they just want you know and they think they're being smart and i see this all the time but somebody keeps saying i want to invest this money you're asking everybody and they're good yeah what do i do with this money i have this money what do i do why not inquire of the lord you see and it takes an emotional intelligence to sit back with a bank account that has a good amount of money not touch that money and simply inquire of the lord what should i do now you know um this thing of instant gratification is a lack of emotional intelligence yes you know we have we have to learn how to delay gratification sit down and delay you know don't let money move you and swing you if you allow it it will it will you will end up doing things you never thought you could and also another thing it is good to be massive and we are called to be given yeah but don't be the kind of guy who gives everybody everything you know you've given your rent money now you have no rent you've now crossed over from faith to foolishness and you didn't know when you crossed yeah it's a thin line sometimes between faith and foolishness so you know don't give everything away some people are controlled by you know family yes your father is one who knows what you're doing with your money when will you grow up mature and handle your own money you know give where you need to give but at the same time handle your responsibilities so some people just need to deal on that emotional intelligence great questions my friend you have like 20 more minutes to ask questions if you have a question for us today we are talking about the right money mindset even as we look forward to this year 2021 you know 2020 was a harsh year financially people lost their jobs people shut down businesses and we are believing 2021 will be a better year but you know if we have a bad mindset towards money blessings may come in 2021 but we will squander them you know like the son who asked for his inheritance account yeah so that's why it's important to have a right money mindset so uh take this opportunity to ask questions 20316 is the sms line what's up number is zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen it is the financial clinic today we are talking about the right money mindset your questions coming in via sms on 203 16 what's up on zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen nungari is with us in studio via zoom helping us to gain a deeper understanding of uh the right money mindset i have a question here from janet janet says when when when when we talk about money and mindsets she she's always under fear you know there's never enough there's never enough there's never enough and so you know her relationship with money is always based on fear and she's wondering how do i get out of that because the reality on the ground is that actually there's never enough you know it's a struggle every month to just meet the bills how do i get out of that mindset fear to begin with fear is is not a spirit from god the bible says god has not given us a spirit of fear so the moment you start to operate out of fear you're already working with bondage yes you're already in the wrong side the mindset is already off because you and that is why i'm saying you need to renew your mind and that is what she needs to do you must renew your mind so that you know and fully understand that you are helped by god that god will give you you know in when god created man he blessed them the bible says he blessed man he said be fruitful multiply have dominion replenish the earth and subjugate it you see that word replenishment you cannot replenish anything unless you yourself are replenished and usually most people do not understand that you can ask god to replenish your finances yeah when you see your money going down ask god replenish me lord he will we keep telling each other be replenished spiritually be replenished oh may you gain more strength more grace why not ask god replenish me financially yes that part of our it is part of our covenant that god will replenish us you know and then i hear people saying i'm going through a wilderness i don't have i don't have but i will tell you if i'll challenge that thought because in the wilderness god provided for them manner from heaven very true god gave them you know meat came in the wind yes god made sure their clothes never were off you know they had shoes their clothes grew with them so even if you're in a place that place we like to call wilderness yeah in that place specifically god will provide for you in fact things get thicker when you get to the promised land yes because in the promised land they had to tell the land yeah they had to work the land at that point god was blessing the work of their hands but you have to get rid of fear it is a spirit it is horrible it is bondage the bible says fear has comment and what she is describing is being tormented by fear so rebuke it rebuke fear and then put your confidence in god and declare that confidence i know that my god is well able to meet every need for he has said i will supply all of your needs you know put scripture at the devil you know when he preaches to you and tells him and says what the devil preaches to you even you preach why are you keeping your mouth shut when he came to jesus jesus said it is written he was preaching to the devil very true even you preach back i do not have a spirit of fear i refuse to fear my god shall supply all of my needs rojo jew you know when you keep walking this life and enjoy it god shall replenish you wow i have another one here from lily lily says thank you so much for the great show my question is i'm a very good saver and a poor investor meaning i have money because i don't misuse it but it doesn't help me much since i don't invest it anywhere please advise that is also the bondage of fear ah you see because this one is not afraid of losing the money so they keep it under lock and key it is a whole different thing but it comes off of the same route yes so what i would advise you is first of all educate yourself you know when you're more knowledgeable about investment you are able to take the risk but as long as you do you have no knowledge where can i invest or what can i do what are the returns then at that point you become so fearful you just want to keep your money saved because you know you don't want to lose it and really who wants to work and then lose the principle you don't want to do that you want it to make more money for you so number one i would ask you again come again as the spirit of fear because that is what that is and then begin to educate yourself the learning never stops and these days we have the internet go on google figure it out join different investment groups online see what people are investing in begin to invest in your own knowledge once you have understanding and of course seek god for where to put your money then as you do that you will have the confidence to step out until then the fear will keep controlling you and that is not right wow in fact several people are actually identifying with the whole aspect of fear you know we have uh ruth muander says yes indeed fear is a liar this year i'm changing my money mindset and then i have another one here uh from fanwell farmville says i do appreciate the financial clinic today i've struggled with fee as well when it comes to money matters now i know what to do a lot of people are held back with fear you know you don't want to lose you're thinking i i don't want to lose that you know and you have this group of people who you know you always feel confident and safe if you have got money with you you don't use it you go to confuco i might go to your mattress you are good or those people go to the atm just to check the balance like five times a day thank you very much what would you do you know i used to be that person oh really oh my goodness i love looking at my bank balance oh to look you know yes and then when i saw how the money is piling up my heart would just be okay but you know what now this is somebody who has made money their crotch really their confidence is no longer in god it's not the confidence now has shifted it is in the money okay and that is a dangerous place to be because what god will do because he would rather have you poor than lose you rich yes he will just come and pull the rug out from under you you will lose that money so that you can turn back and see god so what i would advise that person today today defense just repent because you have made malia idol it is your crutch that is where your help comes from and remember that is something that should only be given to god it is only god you know the bible says he's our strong tower we run to him and we are safe but you you have made money you are strong tower you are running to it and you are safe when you see it there you feel confident the future is bright the future is bright because of god not because you have money in the past even if you have no money in the bank if you have god your future remains bright so that person needs to change and stop making money they are good god someone says please talk to us about the scarcity mentality oh my that i think that is the worst because this is a person who it you know a lot scarcity mentality it goes also with these people who think they are cast they always cast oh yes you know where the life is against me the world is against me god must have every children because me i never have that is the worst place you can be you see and that is an identity issue the bible talks to us about the children of the king if you read the bible in the story of the kings and maybe the greatest one king david you will realize that david his children would eat at the table of the king yeah no yeah he would he would that is where his children would eat and if if ever you you would also eat at the table of the king so your provisions were totally provided for all the time and that is what we must understand that we are the sons of god if you are born again you have become a son of god you eat at the table of the king how was it you eat at the table of the king so stop thinking that you know resources are scarce finances are scarce opportunities are scarce yeah everything is cast so you your work is to wake up every day chasing after opportunities you don't even have time to pray you're always running take a breather check your theology your dog dreams yes what do you understand about your relationship with god where money is concerned once you understand that god is the giver that you feast at his table on a daily you know it's a daily thing then like jesus said you will ask give me my daily bread just if today i'm fed i'm good because you know god has your tomorrow and god is interesting because life is in times and seasons yeah there are seasons where you don't have and the seasons you have even paul says he went through seasons of need yes and seasons of plenty his secret was that he learned to be content in whichever season he was in and you have to be content you have to get to the place where you say i'm in a season of luck it will not last this is a temporary place it will be forever yes see the bible families never came to last forever apparently would come because that is that is what a family represents economic scarcity so a famine would come it will come for a few years and go then plenty would return so scarcity is always a temporary thing anytime you go through a difficult financial time yeah remind yourself this is a passing cloud it will pass you know hungary i'm thinking that this scarcity mindset is is something that a lot of us in africa uh have to deal with you know i think i don't know whether it was planted in us we we always feel like we don't have enough and we have to depend on the west to come and save us you know that is why you find our leaders you know stealing money and stashing it away in banks overseas and you're wondering for what you know i mean i i i had the opportunity i've had the opportunity to travel to egypt and to travel to israel when we do our israel via egypt trip and one of the things that amazes me is what the people in israel do with their land their land is desert as in desert as we are blessed with land i don't know that can grow what but we still think we don't have enough we don't have enough sirikali's idea you know what what to say dear china's idea and i think it's something that is so deeply ingrained in us as africans we forget that africa is the richest continent on the globe yeah we have the most resources we have got brilliant minds we have got the best land in the world but mindset has we are slaves you know we we also have the most youthful population across the globe yes and just the fact that we have a youthful population means we have people to do to labor yes you know and to have success and and really what what comes up with that it's like a land helplessness i don't know where this came from it's like a land helplessness and and perhaps because um if you look through history the black man has always been oppressed for the skin color yeah but you see we have to break away from these chakras we have to break away and it's more mental than physical you have to break away from this idea that you're just poor you're just beggarly unless somebody comes to help you you cannot be held very true no god is your health look up i always say look up tell god you know jeremiah 17 says this it says blessed is the man who puts his trust in god yes that one will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water it will always be green vibrant you know bearing fruit cast is the man who leans on man who looks to man for help it says that man and this really scares me because it says that man he will not see good even when it comes wow yeah so good will come but he wouldn't but because he's looking to man he will not see it wow so why not change your mentality and you know what we cannot continue blaming our parents forever yeah we you know i come from the ghetto i've always been poor this is how we've always been or whatever no we have to get to a place as adults when you grow up yeah that you have now to come to a place where you decide i have to take responsibility for my growth in the financial area i have to take responsibility yes so you take yourself to god sit down have a come quincy the two of you you say jehovah god you have to help me you are my help i have no one else yeah if you do not lift me up there's nobody coming to save me you are my savior so save me now give me wisdom and understanding show me what to do i am here i am strong all i have is my ability my health nicotine maybe you don't even have an education or whatever those things do not make a man i'm telling you life has a way of equalizing all of us yes we have educated people who are in poverty and we are people who never went to school doing so well ask god for wisdom ask god for wisdom for the marketplace he will take you through and you will rise because of god wow there's one more type of person i want us to talk talk about uh in about two minutes because we are out of time there's this group of people niwa choyo bakar najinima you know as in you have got you have got a good chunk of change in the bank like in here walking around with a torn shirt you know your shoes your shoes are in another angle the people wonder how are you able to walk in those shoes yeah you you don't even do anything for yourself you're always saving i don't know you're saving for what ever talk to us about this group of people that is a is a terrible mindset and it goes beyond just being frugal you know being frugal is where you are not wasteful yes and actually the word prodigal son means wasteful sun i always thought it meant the bad sun it means the waste fusa so when you're frugal you are not wasteful but when you have extreme frugality now you become a maester where you even in your house you just barely making it you know your children if they have uniform it is good usually when you have money you can afford it that is bondage yes the bible says when you have wealth in ecclesiastes to have wealth and the good health to enjoy it is a gift from god now you instead of enjoying what god has given you you're refusing to enjoy yeah we would rather live like somebody who's utterly poverty that is bad bondage your mind you are bound you need to shake off that it's called what are you break that joke shake it off from your neck and say this one i will not deal with it anymore from today i am being prosperous i'm working prosperous i am being blessed and that is how i'm going to do it and listen some things you have to take the step of faith hand me down second hand you know and you're thinking see you've got money in the bank county what is that money for anyway dungaree i'm out of time but i feel like we should just continue with this discussion maybe we'll pick it up again on another day thank you so much for being a part of the financial clinic today what's your parting shot thank you james thank you so much for having me parting is simply get to know what the bible says about money if you are a believer god has promised you wealth and he has a way for you to get it and learn from the word of god i'm sending everybody back to the word of god with the holy ghost as your teacher learn from the best i love that i love that that's all the time we have today and you know from what nungari has said i remember reading a book this gentleman had written a book i can't remember the name of the book but basically his business failed he was at a place where you know you are down to nothing and he cried out just the way nungar is telling us he went to god and he told god if you don't save me if you don't help me i have no one else to go to and god began to teach him from the book of proverbs god took him to the book of proverbs and boy did that man's life change his business was transformed totally and he goes around teaching people how to do business from the book of proverbs the bible has a lot to say about money let's not be afraid for of money it is a tool we need to be able to fulfill the things god has called us to fulfill for this and more of our shows log on to www.family to enjoy a

"x2BJP530hVQ": "hello friends my guest this week is murphy murray murphy is a very well respected and well-known cannabis extraction expert she flies all over the country and all over the world to help commercial cannabis growers put in extraction technology what's really cool about murphy's story is she's completely self-taught she came from the business and growing side of the cannabis industry taught herself tons of chemistry and biotechnology and now that's her main thing is she's consulting and and uh helping train and implement extraction technologies at large scales for uh for canada for the cannabis industry and she's very impressive and i really enjoy talking with her she she you'll notice in the podcast she had her son with her he's going to be quite the social media expert because he wanted to get in on the conversation several times but i mean i can't think of another person more knowledgeable about cannabis and that's a field that i don't know a lot about but not only does she know a lot about every aspect of that business but she also knows a lot about the chemistry and underlying science foreign for example i didn't know really what terpenes were there's lots of cannabinoids but just little things like can you really determine the quality of cannabis just by looking at it what about those percentages that the dispensers dispensaries put on the cannabis does that actually mean anything we talked a lot about that and we also talked about the where the cannabis industry is going in the next five years and how the cannabis growers are today are adapting by looking at the psychedelics market and potentially looking at how they can transition into this new market opportunity that it's emerging so if you're at all interested in the science and technology side of cannabis and cannabis extraction this is a real treat and i'm very thankful for mary uh murphy's time and uh without further ado murphy bird all right murphy thank you for joining the the podcast uh very happy to have you thank you for having me interested to talk uh with someone who doesn't also live in the cannabis world i'm interested to see what kind of questions you've got i know when i first found out about you actually i think you followed me from a thin layer chromatography video that i did when i was first like getting into learning biotech stuff and then i started following your updates and i noticed that you were doing i didn't understand what it was actually to be honest with you i saw you with lots of stainless steel equipment and lots of like cool pics of what i guess are purified or extracted cannabinoids but maybe you could just start with telling everybody what it is that you do yeah i i do a lot of things um but especially uh now in my career i've been working with canvas since 2009. um so like my entire adult life basically and um i started out on the retail end i have worked uh i've owned gardens and owned dispensaries but my primary focus now is the extraction world and that's been my focus since about 2011. i got to that really quickly and the lab life is a really exciting part of the cannabis industry for a couple of different reasons and i think one of the funnest ones is um that when you compare it to the laboratory environment of almost any other industry cannabis kind of does everything their own way and so some of that is good and some of that is crazy uh but that's kind of the fun part about science i think is that we all get to disagree pretty often and um so what i do now is design equipment and optimize equipment for use extracting and purifying cannabis and cannabinoids and um and that takes me all over the country all over the world and like the the job varies every single time that i go in there you know when you're doing your thin layer chromatography you already know what the product is that you're looking for most of my chromatography is categories of stuff i have no idea how to quantify or identify and can't have in their words and so most of my job is like chasing those mystery compounds without the tools to actually do it which is really fun um but it's also kind of hard to describe because it doesn't follow that same pathway that traditional chemistry does to a individual singular identifiable product um almost no cannabis products get anywhere close to 99 purity so um so it's chemistry procedures without a chemistry outcome wow that's really interesting so how did you go from you said before this your background was in canada you were in the cannabis industry for a while yeah you know and the things you were doing running dispensaries and gardens those aren't necessarily i wouldn't think of as having a lot of overlap with what you do now other than it's the same industry but what you're actually doing is to completely different do you have a chemistry background or a biology background how did you learn this not at all um i started i went to school for marketing that's my that's my academic background um and uh and then i got into retail kind of by accident and i was 21. so like i did a lot of things uh you know i worked in a salon for a couple of months you know like that it was a um it was kind of a transitional job originally and just the nature of cannabis is so adaptive and a little bit against the grain you know it's kind of a rebellious industry in and of itself which means that if there is a standard procedure or a normal um you know sort of like means of growing through an industry that doesn't apply to us either because it can't or because we resist it and so there aren't the barriers to entry to get into cannabis that there is to research or um you know pharmaceuticals uh you know or any of these other types of um you know chemistry industries you don't have to be a chemist to go buy an hplc and try to add up thc you know you uh it helps but you know there's not any of that requirement necessarily and um and a lot of that just comes from you know that black market transition so um you know for the first 100 years of cannabis uh existing as a monetary uh trade product in america it was just the gross right and they're communicating directly with the consumer essentially or the person who's selling it to them and so that was our authority on the product and so all of our research and development about cannabis has largely come from growing cannabis or israel and that's it pretty much you know like we owe almost everything we know about cannabis to the research teams in israel and a lot of that just has to do with the fact that they could do whatever they want they don't have to deal with american laws so traditional researchers and traditional research methods didn't exist so we don't have any of that protocol for developing these products so if you want to sell cannabis all you have to do is have some cannabis you can sell it and if you want to have some cannabis all you have to do is grow it so you could just go grow it and so anybody can get involved really easily it's very easy to fail um so there's that barrier for entry that you have to have money to waste and product to lose in order to learn those lessons which is exactly how i learned everything that i know is by repeated failures and good notes um and so i was able to get into it just through the natural progression of the industry that if i needed hash for my dispensary and i couldn't get it then i need to go make it um it's you know it's a very self-starter type of industry of if you can do it i can do it and so a lot of people in a lot of businesses do everything they um it's called vertical integration and so they'll grow it they'll process it and they'll sell it and uh it's hard to be really good at any one of those things and all of the others you know like most people are either the social marketing person who's going to run a dispensary well or they're like the intuitive plant person that works best alone or they're the lab guy who you know lives for cleanliness and procedure and um so i i've done a little bit of all of it and it's not where i expected to be but the lab is where i have had the most fun and it's also the only part that's been um challenging in a rewarding way like i really love the time that i spend in the lab it's a lot of fun so that's really cool i see a lot of overlap between what you do and amateur mushroom growers because there's a there's a huge community online of people that are helping each other get started sharing texts and tools and with an emphasis on making things low cost and easy and it sort of sounds like because of your you already were in the industry and around it you had a network to tap into and also just had some ancillary experiences you said you needed hash so you had to go and figure out how to get it and um that's really really cool and so now that you that's like i guess the company i don't know if it's your company or the company you work for but that's their only thing right now is they do but consulting for for companies that want to start doing extraction cannabis experience yeah so um so it's my uh consulting and um and so i've got uh fabricators who can build and um i've also got some people that help out with you know training and um implementation but essentially i take on one client at a time and we uh and uh more often than not that problem is that they have too much weed not enough hash how do we get from point a to point b um faster and so um a lot of times i'm going in and taking someone who's processing you know maybe 20 to 50 pounds a day and trying to get them over 200 pounds a day um or i'll be going in and talking to someone who is you know not hitting the purity and quality goals that they've set out for themselves and we'll be figuring out where and why and then resolving that either through process uh changes or through equipment changes yeah yeah and i gotta admit and we should probably like orient people more because um there's a lot probably that people listen to including myself that don't know a lot about cannabis extracts and what they are and why you would want them and exactly so i'm familiar with regular weed that you smoke you know but beyond that you know i've never been into like dabbing but i couldn't even tell you a lot about it could you maybe to help like orient newbies to the industry and and i say this part of the reason why i wanted to add this conversation because biotech sort of touches every industry and the everyman bible podcast is really about shining a light on self-taught diy bio people like yourself whether or not you see yourself that way you sort of are because you're using biology you're growing this amazing plant that has a lot of demand and medicinal value and you're using these self-taught skills that you've learned along the way and you're using chemistry and you're tying that all together into a really like burgeoning market that's probably only going to continue to grow in the next decade so like extracts what's the 101 high level what are they why are growers like into extracts how are they used sure so um we'll start with the basics uh the cannabis plant or marijuana um same same thing different names uh it's a resinous plant and so what that means is that like literal resin sticky stuff uh develops on the outside of the cannabis plant and that part is really interesting and really important because there are a lot of things that we can extract from plants um and where that thing is in the plant matters a lot when it comes to our extraction with cannabis almost everything we want is on the outside and it grows in these trichomes uh which are just kind of like a waxy little container full of that resin and that resin is going to contain your cannabinoids which are the uh the things that have medical benefits for your body as well as the um you know the starting components to what's going to get you high later and have that psychoactive effect inside those trichomes you also have some other fatty acids some other compounds you also have the plant uh basically sweating terpenes the way that flowers emit smells um you're also going to see things like flavonoids and esters that are going to contribute to flavor in that resin and so it's a really complicated resin and the word resin um and specifically resin from cannabis or hash is kind of all just this like lump term for the sticky goo that we get off of this plant but ultimately that's the goods everything else on the plant all the leaf the bed itself is is nothing that's carbon raw plant material that um is just the carrier for you to get that sticky stuff into your body so when you're smoking cannabis you are burning leaves and vaporizing resin at the same time is the idea um and so that's where it gets really complicated is that you know each of these plants can produce different amounts of resin the resin can have different primary ingredients in it depending on what you feed it or what was happening to that plant at the time that you harvested it a plant that's like currently under attack from mites is going to emit different terpenes than one that is like chilling isolated in a sterile environment so um so the resin itself could be hundreds of active compounds and that's why extraction is so important is that we don't know what all of those are we know what some of them are and we don't know what those some of them all do and we certainly don't know what they all do together with each other in different combinations and so extraction allows us first to break that apart into large categories of compounds as well as just breaking it all the way down into individually what is this molecule versus that one and that's a very long process that we have barely touched the surface of there's 400 terpenes that we've identified that cannabis can produce your weed doesn't have 400 terpenes but which ones does it have is takes us some time to get into and break apart and so extraction helps speed up that identification process by first of all just isolating these compounds so that it's easier to test for them it's much easier to look at a map of two places than twenty so we wanna um we wanna break it down just for that analytical value and then from there um what we can also do in that process is remove things we don't want remove things that are known to be harmful or known to be toxic or that don't contribute in a meaningful way to your experience so in the same way that like the leaves are not helping you get high they're just stuff you're catching on fire and inhaling the smoke and tar from um there's lots of stuff in that resin that we don't need either um and that all depends on you know how you consume it that's where the bio part of our tech gets real complicated because we have to deal with the biology of the plant and then mix that up with the biology of individual humans and so the possibilities are endless that's that equation we'll never get to the end of uh but it's a really fun one because there is so much to break apart and so when um when we're studying it and identifying these compounds that level of extraction very high end a lot of precision involved in that the other half of extraction is all about delivering you that resin in a consistency that you can consume and so that part of extraction gets very loose because i can just touch weed get that sticky stuff on my fingers follow it up and now i have hash because it's just the resin that we started with and i haven't done anything so hash is just hash is just the the outside yeah is there any truth i'm so glad i get to speak to a cannabis expert here when you go into a dispensary and they show you the product is there really any way of gauging the quality or how good of a product it is just by looking at its physical characteristics well you have to start by defining quality right so you know in that regard um like this is where chemistry is easier because chemistry would be like what did you want thc well then whichever one has the most thc wins right but it's not that simple because a lot of thc plus cbd is not the same effect as a lot of thc by itself or a lot of cbd by itself and so you have all those different um you know qualities to consider and the way they work together and all of those make up your personal definition of good um and then you have all the other compounds to consider so terpenes are your aroma so they'll make it smell a certain way so is that why they they have you smell it and that's more like i guess a personal preference totally absolutely the um the inhalation of certain terpenes certainly has studied value um it can you know influence your body in important ways and some of the terpenes like mercy and we know um interact with thc and uh you know have have relevant impact in your body when you consume them um but that's only valid if you are smoking it right not if it's in food because your stomach acid will destroy terpenes so there's that that's a that's a marketing gimmick um your stomach can't smell so that one doesn't help but the terpenes again are just aroma and so um if you care about like medical value and effect the things like the terpenes and the cannabinoids are obvious uh priorities but the actual flavor that you taste in your mouth that comes from like esters and flavonoids um terpenes taste disgusting they're bitter they're awful um you don't taste the terpenes if you do you wouldn't want to smoke weed so you've got things like flavonoids that are really important it can afflict um and uh that one gives you um some also noted uh effects that have you know demonstrated some value in your consumption some of these um flavonoids and esters are important for when you eat cannabis because of the way that they can protect other compounds in your stomach acid oh interesting um and so you know it's like you have all these different applications you have all these different priorities so the type of concentrate i would want if i'm going to go home and dab it versus the kind of concentrate i want if i'm going to go home and put it in food and even then the type of concentrate i want if i smoke only a little bit late at night versus something that i want to smoke all day long like these are all different products you know um it's kind of like saying well which pain reliever is best like what kind of pain do you have what is the i'm curious to know like what is the underlying chemical difference between like a cannabis and sativa you know because they're they're marketed as having different and even hybrids your market is having different effects right but is that just a variation on thc and cbd or is it more complex than that so sativa and indica are classifications of phenotypes [Music] all plants and um and so it's a it's a physical characteristic of that plant so a sativa grows very tall has long skinny leaves um you know generally flowers for longer and that's because those sativas came from areas in the world where those features are important to survival you know if there's a lot of other vegetation i need to grow taller if there's a lot of pests i need to have narrower leaves less food for my enemies right um whereas an indica would come from a totally opposite landscape where they have a shorter growing season so they can't spend all of their time growing tall and they have less sunlight so they have to have wider leaves to absorb that to gain enough energy to move on to the next phase of their life which is produce seeds reproduce and die um so you know these plants uh as far as sativas and indicas go these are physical attributes to help them in their environment you know so that's like short people versus tall people you know like redheads and you know blondes like it's a physical description now if we're talking about a plant that is a sativa and is growing in that like rainforest environment right now that life experience of that plant is um going to influence the type of chemicals it is going to produce in its lifespan so like i mentioned earlier if it's being attacked by bugs it's producing the types of terpenes that are designed to deter those bugs if i'm this cush plant growing up in the top of the mountains and there's not a bumblebee for two miles let alone aphids or anything that i have to worry about then i'm going to smell as good as i possibly can to attract that one bumble bee and i don't have to worry about the pests right so those plants have a predisposition to produce slightly different chemicals based on their lived experience and if i take those two plants and i put them both in a sterile room and grow them next to each other i can almost make them mimic each other in that chemical output because i'm going to feed them the same things they're going to have the same lived experience as far as temperature humidity wind nutrients uh you know lack of pests things like that and so there is that genetic predisposition where some strains are just going to produce more cbd they're going to produce more tacv um you know we're going to smell like lemons you know like there's some genetic aspects to that you know in the same way that like not all tall people have heart disease but some of them might you know and it's not because they're tall but like maybe a lot of tall people have heart disease you know it's really hard to say uh you know what is the cause versus what is just like two similar facts so when they say like indica has a more a sedative type experience with it it how much of that is true no because the leaves were fat and the leaves don't have the resin that you're smoking it's um so you could get a sativa and that could have a that could have exactly the same as chloroplasts i can have a sativa or an indica that produces a lot of cbd and so what might be sedative is having two percent cbd in there you know what might be sedative is having more mercy as the dominant terpene versus like lemony which is a stimulant you know um and so like the you know and a lot of people want we want to classify everything you know we want to be able to progress and this is what's going to happen but you know if you look at something like alcohol for example right so ethanol is ethanol in all of the different alcohols ultimately that's the same thing getting you drunk yeah and i could put the same amount of ethanol in two different alcohols um but whiskey and tequila don't feel the same and depending on who you are risky might be for you and tequila might not or opposite and now we can say well the whiskey has a lot of gluten um or the you know tequila has a lot of sugar you know we can start saying this is why it's this one other thing that's such a good never that simple it's never that simple you know and sometimes it's not the whiskey or the tequila it's the you sometimes you're the one who just shouldn't have margaritas you know so like it's hard to it's hard to classify your experience with a plant like that you're both so complicated that it's really hard to predict that and so you can say i've tried lemon kush and it made me very tired and now when you buy more lemon push it'll probably still make you tired that doesn't mean i don't have that experience it doesn't mean your friend will have that experience because your friends might like tequila and you might not you know like it's just it's there's too many variables to break it down but the indica and sativa part kind of comes from that uh you know that history of cannabis where all the information we've ever gotten is from the growers so you know who cares a lot about indica and sativa is a grower who has eight foot ceilings versus 14 foot ceilings i don't have time for your sativas if my ceilings don't go up to 14 feet i wouldn't have room for those sativas you know um and you know similarly uh if i have an overly humid environment and i can't maintain that humidity well i don't want to be growing those indicates because they're too dense and they're gonna mold you know so like you end up making really important choices in the garden based on phenotype because it's about the plants um it's not about the chemotype and the chemotype is what category of chemicals it's producing and so chemotype if we had fun words like sativa and indica for it would give you more information but chemotype is a very very very long list so i would have to have every letter in the alphabet represented to give you you know uh an even kind of spread and so you know like a nutritional facts for for example right and the nutritional facts uh that would still really tell you like here's the compounds in it and then you would have to go and find out what are they what do they do how does that affect you um you know and that information is as deep and dark as google itself so there's a lot to get into so when you go to dispensary because i'm in california and i've been to a dispensary and it shows you thc levels as a percentage and cbd levels how does that work are they sending the is the grower sending it off to a lab that's sort of doing the testing probably doing very similar work that as what you're doing which is actually extracting that out and measuring it and certifying it and sending it back it sounds like though and i'll let you answer that question but it sounds like those two numbers are really just a small piece of the puzzle of the effects that it that it could potentially have yeah so in most uh states especially anywhere where you see recreational cannabis they are going to have third testing requirements so you can always test it yourself but that's not what goes on the package what goes on the package has to be certified by a third-party lab and usually those labs are held at iso standards and are you know similar to like a urine analysis lab or any other type of lab where you're just bringing in samples and testing for a specific panel of active ingredients and um and depending on what you're testing for there's different methods used for that potency for thc cbd etc that's usually going to be an hplc test and uh you know there is some that are going to use gas chromatography instead but generally that's not preferred for this application because of the decarboxylation that can occur um you can do the math backwards but who wants to do math you know um so hplc is kind of the standard for that but then you also have these labs testing for like terpenes and residual solvents and a lot of that is going to be your gas chromatography to quantify those um you're going to have pesticide testing um which is going to be you know a column and mass spec um you know and you're gonna have heavy metal testing which is you know as a digestion there's a whole bunch of different methods um but this individual sample that represents however many pounds of actual oil or weed um actually you know represents that that number gets very um you know spread out and it's almost always just based on what is required there's very little voluntary extras going on and um and so all that's you know required uh to be certified by a third party that goes on the label and then that goes to you uh and so now you're getting you know that let's say you know let's say your weed says that it's 20 thc right um so it's 80 not and uh if they detect more heavy metals and more pesticide and no molds you know you know like they've gone through all that other list then we're still at 80 percent what uh and there's no effort to close the gap right like a mass balance of everything that's in there is not accounted for and that's i think the strangest thing about cannabis is that it is very common for someone to buy a concentrate an extract and it'll be 70 candidates and 30 i don't know you know 30 of no one has checked and so that's the part that i think is the most important for consumers to care about because what we know is great that's information we can use and work with what we don't know is the biggest variance and so that's where the same amount of ethanol in whiskey versus tequila isn't the right amount of information what else is in there you know if that's 70 by weight then what's bit of a 30 because that's what's going to give you different experiences because the thc is the same you know the cbd is the same no matter where i get it from no matter what strain i get from no matter what plant or field whatever at its isolated molecule they're identical um so it's the other stuff that really is important to us and if a grower is getting sending off a small sample and getting interested how much of that varies between plants of the same all of it there's no it's not even that particularly like it's not accurate like say say your your go-to is pineapple express i'm just going to name one you could you could have wildly different profile chemical profiles not only between geographic areas but growers and and even within the same grower individual plants and even on the plant itself so the buds at the top that are closest to the light are going to have a different chemical uh you know profile than the ones at the bottom that are in the shape and there's often a very large price difference between some of the more i don't know higher quality or that's at least how they're marketed right but you could maybe get a cheaper weed but still have an amazing experience with it exactly and that's why i answered your other question with like how do you define quality because you know if you're going into it for thc content and avoiding lemon flavors because you know you haven't had good experiences with those but you want to get high you know like you can set your own rules as a shopper um then you know these exotic strains what makes them more expensive is not the amount of thc or whether or not it smells like lemon it's um the exclusivity of the genetic right um and so it would be uh the fact that it's a new genetic or that it's in a rap song or that it's grown by a grower with incredible branding and really nice jars it is marketed to you in the same way that you know you have 14 different options of mid-shelf vodka that are the same and like half of them will come from the same distillery and it's just a different bottle and the one with the wax on the lid is four dollars more and you're a sucker so you fall for that same thing with cannabis that's the marketing part you know which is that if you will pay more for it that will be fine we will we will take more money for it that will be okay we'll uh give you another excuse so the chemical content is not really a factor in that purchase a lot of it is how can i market it because a bread that is extremely resinous and has a really high ratio of relevant chemical compounds would be loose and kind of leafy it would be ugly an ounce would take up a whole freezer bag um it would not you know it would not have the appeal of like this beautiful purplish with pink hairs frosty buds like these cool you know interesting plant features are totally aesthetic and [Music] since you're buying it based on appearance we push the aesthetic you know but like the cheeseburger on the menu is not the cheeseburger in your bag always so you've got to keep that in mind and then you just really got to think about what what matters to you as a consumer you know if i'm making you know cheap cheap margaritas for a party i'm going to get the cheaper tequila because it's fine you know if i want to celebrate a fancy night out it might buy a higher end you know like there's there's all these different reasons why i might make this one purchase or another it's very rarely the chemical purity sometimes just to feel like how do you feel about it right a placebo kind of thing some of the buds they're marketed as smelling it particularly you use lemon as your example but i've i've heard and re seen other ones and some of them are so strong in one particular smell like strawberry or they go beyond lemon and it always crossed my mind that it doesn't seem real because they almost don't smell like regular weed but are is it real are there any growers that are actually like putting some sort of you know smell enhancer on like like it's not like spraying on a perfume where the smell is coming from somewhere else but um we can control plants quite a bit and so if you think of it this way like if you eat asparagus your body makes certain smells right like certain diets make certain people's body odor smell a certain way we can influence a plant based on how we feed it and we can also influence that plant based on its lived experience so you know it starts with making sure it doesn't produce the stinky terpenes that are designed to deter pests right because they're gonna smell bad i don't need those anywhere near my my product it's gonna you know it only takes a little bit of bad to ruin the rest of the good um and then there's certain terpenes that are just in cannabis no matter what based on the type of plant that it is so mercy is a good example of that merchants and hops as well as cannabis they're in the same family and cannabis produces a lot of mercen and that's a pretty strong smell it's not necessarily one that people gravitate towards like some people love that you know hops kind of smell um but you know that's usually the one that like your mom is complaining about when you smell like weed right is that like kind of lingering musky sort of um smell um then we have a whole bunch of others that are just kind of from the genetic regions that these plants originally came from so you're going to see uh you know this strong citrus from areas where there was a lot of pests because these strong citrus are natural insecticides so those plants just kind of have the genes to produce that certain smell um you know and you know just like that other plant with no bumblebees around it's going to go out of its way to smell incredible and so it's also going to produce those smells based on the competing vegetation and so if there's a lot of stuff that smells like citrus i'm going to smell like strawberries you know because that's going to get the bumblebees over here where i want them you know and so um so some of it is genetic predisposition and some of it is just kind of feeding and stressing the plants out one thing that's really interesting about cannabis is that a lot of those smells and the complexity of that flavor is the result of us growing it if that plant was growing in the wild it would have smelled good for a week gotten pollinated and then it would have gone into a mother mode and started protecting those seeds from pests and environment again and so you know a green fresh young cannabis plant does not smell like gingerbread or you know strawberry uh blueberry or muffins or whatever you know it smells like a green plant because that is the smell that keeps gnats away and aphids off your leaves and so if if cannabis was allowed to go back into seed production we would see a lot more of those flavors but because we prevent it from ever producing seeds we kill it at the peak of it trying to be as attractive as it possibly can all of that incredible smell is to attract pollinators that we are prohibiting from getting there so that creates a ton of stress on that plant which makes it open up new ways you know to try and attract those pollinators so like that's a very human impact you know like we do that to cannabis cannabis doesn't do that for us it does that to fight us and we're just tricking it um because we like it so that's where a lot of breeders will select plants that happen to have those notes cross-breed them back with other plants that are um you know have physical attributes that they want or similar flavors that they want or you know other you know resin features that they're looking for and we've created you know like all cannabis is is genetically modified through selective breeding in that sense that we've decided what we want cannabis to look and smell and taste like so it's as real uh as the plant producing it but it is not through natural evolution that's that's the result of us growing indoors yeah really cool so i think most people when they think about like what are the active ingredients we talked a little bit about this thc and cbd those are sort of the main ones but with extraction you're basically i guess it sounds like the first step is you're taking away the plant matter from the resin are you then extracting out the resin into like separation of that you talk a little bit about that are you separating that like terpenes which i think you said control the smell of it right and then and then there's the actual uh cannabinoids which are like that has the psychoactive components as well as like i think there's hundreds of cannabinoids as well but and you said that i think you said when you do the interac extraction 70 of it is known but then there's always this remaining 30 percent i mean yeah that's where the type of extraction um starts to become really relevant because you know if we use my first example of like the weed of sticky i touch it now the sticky is on me i've got an extract here um that's going to have a little bit of plant material still remaining it's going to have all of the like you know fats and waxes that were containing that resin um it's also going to have degradation products because as soon as i've burst that little trichome now everything in there is exposed to oxygen and what's a trichome just so um trichomes are those little noodly guys that you see uh pictures of they're sticking off of the end of the leaf okay so there's the leaf and then there's the crystals on the leaf which is yes they look like crystals but that's it's actually gooey resin yeah okay so that's a resin and then there's also these little what do you i don't know what you call them you had it like not stems but these little orange fuzzy holes yeah little hairs that stick out and what's is there a difference in what the little hairs have versus the rest yeah for sure so the resin is is where your cannabinoids are all of the hairs and all that kind of structure is um you know these are these are differences for the plant that um you know have a lot to do with like attracting pollen and trapping pollen versus um you know making the buds inaccessible um it also uh you know has a lot to do with like the growing environment and so you know you're gonna see plants with really wide leaves and not a lot of small sugar leaf um and then you're gonna see the exact opposite where they have a lot of little sugar leaves and so it's just you know it's kind of um you know it's just the diversities in the plant you know like all of these different roses have kind of different features but they all kind of smell like roses too um so you know the the resin itself within that trichome that's the most relevant um there is going to be some uh other content throughout the plant material that's valuable for reasons um we have things like you know like certain compounds within that leaf material that may very well help protect cannabinoids in your stomach when you consume it for example but they don't really play into anything that i'm gonna smoke and so when it comes down to vaporizing or smoking it i want as few ingredients in there as possible and uh you know because anything extra is just something i'm catching on fire right anything extra could be potentially leading to more degree degradation and um you know it's going to contribute to flavors that start out smelling grounding and smelling herbs so in that way you know the different types of extraction are going to either target compounds that they want or directly target removing compounds that we don't and so depending on the quality of the material that we're extracting and depending on the product that we want to make at the end of it we might focus on a method of extraction where i'm going straight to isolate i want 99 i want just the cbd um or i might be looking for a product that has as much of that flavor as i can preserve and preserving some of that flavor does call for preserving some of those other compounds because terpenes are unstable by themselves and you know esters and things like that can can denature and get old so we we want to not just expose them and leave them all by themselves you know and like think of uh mushroom extraction for that reason like some of these compounds you get for a minute and then you know you you can destroy it easier than you can make it and so some of our extraction processes are preservation oriented some of them are about removing contaminants and a lot of them are about trying to compromise those two goals for the least amount of money so what are some of the main products that come out of the extraction process and what are the difference uh different extraction techniques that are used to create those main products so i mean i think the first category is concentrates that you're going to dab for smoke and those tend to be the 70 to 80 to 90 purity range they're rarely up in the 99s um of just cannabinoids yeah just cannabinoids and that's um that's in part because we want a lot of that flavor to stay in there and because a lot of that extra uh content can help influence the texture and the appearance um so you know if i have thc a and it's 99 pure that's a white powder and you can touch it if i have thc and it's 99 pure as a sticky gooey liquid and you can't get it into or out of a jar without heating up so depending on how you want to smoke that if you want to sprinkle it on your joint you don't want 99 thc that's going to be a nightmare right um but uh you know joey diaz level or if you know who that is but yeah it's you know it's so part aesthetic and part kind of function in that way where um you know having delta nine that's you know only part of it and having a whole bunch of thc a instead and not allowing it to decarb can give me a product that's more tangible or it'll give me a product that looks like a diamond and so you'll pay more for it you know um oh wow okay you know we have you know we have these different physical structures because the acidic form um of thc that thca uh is a crystalline solid whereas delta 9 is a you know very sticky liquid and that's just their natural state what's the wax that's the only thing uh that's one of those situations where um the name is just to describe what it looks like so think of shatter shadow is not like a noun that's a verb right but we call shatter shatter because you could break it and it would shatter like glass um so when people call that um that smoking concentrate wax it's not because of actual wax content necessarily it's because it looks like wax and so um and it has more th uh c a it will have more thc a then um than anything else to have that solid structure but so does shatter so shatter and wax are basically the same product um the difference between shatter and wax is that with shatter i have taken my oil but it still has solvent in it um not very much just a little bit and i put it really thin and so when it when all that solvent is evaporated i'm gonna have this um translucent solid because it's that thca which is still crystallizing essentially to form that structure um but it's doing so in a pretty homogeneous way because it isn't pure and uh and so then with wax i have the same oil but i rip it up and so i introduce all this air into it so it's not that it's actually different than the shatter it's clear like the shatter if tiny air bubbles that are reflecting light that's what makes it opaque to you like that's a that's an illusion right that's just aesthetic so that's like scrambled eggs versus just frying your mayonnaise it's just how i prepared it to hand to you and so um the same product that can make wax and shatter i can just crystallize it with a little bit more solvent in the solution and grow diamonds and then i could take that pure thco right out of there and all the liquid that's in there would represent the other part that's making up you know the wax and the shatter so the wax and the shatter are homogeneous whereas the crystallized stuff the sauce is those homogeneous compounds but broken up into little pieces before you combine them again anyway to some of them so you know it's very much about like how i'm giving it to you it's like do you want you know alphagata you want that espresso you know on top instead on the bottom or whatever you're asking for um you know a lot of that is presentation aesthetic and you know a little bit just a function of how you want to smoke it um and then you know besides that uh presentation which we can affect literally manually just by how i pour it out how i heat it up how i handle it you also have the differences with different solvent choices and so you know this is where chemistry should play a really important day doesn't always um but what do you mean by that what do you mean by that it sounds like it sounds just like nothing but chemistry well it isn't it isn't so if i again if i were looking at a 99 pure product what i would do is i would choose the best solvent for extracting that compound or i would choose a solvent that's very good for that compound but also simultaneously very bad at extracting the things i don't want i see and there's a lot of methods of extraction and fluid in cannabis that are catch-offs and so like ethanol for example as an extraction solvent gives me a little bit of the water solubles a little bit of the non-polars which means i have a really complicated problem in that bucket when i'm done getting all of that solution out and so you know if i start with something you know like hexane which is going to extract a very specific list of things then i have an easier job cleaning that up and purifying it but i don't have a very specific list of things i want out of that cannabis because i don't know what's in it before i run it most of the time except for like the assumption that there's thc in there or quantification of the thc in there which still is going to tell me how much thc i can get out you know so it's it's still not enough information um so you know we have the opportunity to use really selective solvents or less selective solvents um but what we generally do is just use the solvent that gives us a little bit of both based on what we think is going to be there and then we and then we deal with whatever comes out you know there's a lot of people using co2 in the cannabis industry and co2 is capable of any any type of you know solubility almost if you control it um but what people do is not control it at all and they just say anything that comes out at 2000 psi is what i will have thank you very much and we don't target our extraction um and part of it's because you the consumer doesn't ask us what that other 30 is so we don't have to answer oh that's interesting so what is the main motivator for a grower to get into the extraction side is it to capture more of the market because there's obviously a demand for these products there's also obviously a demand for extraction based products is that the main driver um so there's definitely a you know value in those products but you also can take advantage of attracting [Music] started by trying to get something useful out of the trim the parts of the bed that you don't buy and so the trim is covered in resin anyone who's had to turn before is going to be familiar with that and so there's a lot of resin that is lost um through that trimming process that can be recaptured and so the first reason would be to not throw that away or pay someone else to monetize it you can take your own garbage and turn it into money yeah um extraction is also a get out of jail free card if something goes wrong in the growth and um i've i've run gross before i don't do that now growing is hard and the consequences of things going wrong in the group take time and you still have to finish investing money in it you know um like i i can stop an extraction part way through and say this isn't gonna work and start over again uh there are no do-overs in the grip you know like you grow that plant whatever happens happens you grow that plant perfectly for three and a half months and then you know have a power outage or an employee quit and suddenly it's ruined you know so the um the very uncertain nature of trying to you know grow an agricultural product like cannabis that is so heavily regulated the way that it is um it gives you very little margin for losses and so extraction helps you recover from those losses because even if i do have a pest issue i can extract that product get the useful part out and leave the pest part behind um so you know that it's kind of like insurance against your crop if you can always extract it anyway yeah that's interesting yeah the bigger your crop the more risk you take you know the more potential profit but like all things the more risk you take and especially with growing something like mushrooms or or like uh marijuana it takes a long time it's a long time like a big time investment and uh everything has to sort of go right till the very end for you to reap those rewards so that's that's interesting so what is like if someone wants to get into extraction are people doing this on an individual level or is it mainly just businesses that are doing it um it's it's both absolutely so certain methods of extraction aren't appropriate to try at home because they um are explosive or hexagonal with certain methods of extraction that don't make it appropriate for home um but then there's a lot of methods that are very easy to do at home you know a simple ethanol extraction is relatively easy to do at home equipment to recover that ethanol safely is similar to what you would do if you were home brewing or home distilling um so you know there's that level of chemical extraction that's absolutely happening at a home level and then there's a lot of very simple hash making which is where we're using like dry ice or literally water and ice and instead of dissolving any of that resin we're just separating it from the plant material so we're not getting that really really high purity but we are getting rid of most of the plant that is unnecessary and um and that being you know water and ice it's a little bit cold it may be slippery but very accessible for anyone to try at home it is also just manual labor which is more effort on the commercial side are they are they like what's the investment is it tens of thousands is it hundreds of thousands for i would imagine some of the really large growers it's it's probably quite a bit i've seen some of the equipment you know i don't know does it you have to have a clean room when you do these things it's so yes and no um so because of the nature of the regulatory environment for cannabis it's state by state and it's often municipality by municipality so the county land might have one set of rules and the town within that county might have a different set of rules it gets very nuanced um as far as what's uh required in one place or another that's where analytical labs being iso is standardized like that's you can book up the standard and you can say okay this is what that requires so no carpet over here guys and just you know keep um keep things really consistent but within canvas labs what you'll hear is a lot of weird abbreviations and names and classifications of these labs they're totally made up they're totally fabricated for cannabis and so like a type 7 license in california versus a type 6 license is just whether or not you use flammable solvents but whether or not you have carpet in that lab is like not you know necessarily outlined um so a lot of these rules just come down to who wrote them um ideally you would want uh you know certain safety protocols no matter what and there's a lot of national codes that you know are either written into the laws or that we as an industry elect to impose upon ourselves and uh there's also um you know a lot of like manufacturing processes that we try to mimic but you know it's it's pretty common for someone in cannabis to say we have a gmp facility but they don't because they have floor drains and they have you know like open you know exposed raptors and things like that but what they mean is like i record every single batch of solvent that i get in and i store the coa for it and i can tell you which solvents that uh you know which products use solvent from that batch and so we'll have a piece of gmp but not all of it or i might have you know clean air exchange before i enter one part of my building but not another so it's uh it's never consistent anywhere from one lab to another it's definitely a lot of buzzwords i think when it comes down to that but a lot of us are operating as though national um safety and you know sanitation codes will be imposed because if the federal government legalizes it and the licensing goes out of the hands of the state then it will be fda osha gmp it will be very standard you know consistent rules everywhere and then it'll get to the point where like a dairy is the same almost anywhere that you go um but right now it's crazy every single lab is completely different some labs will require a hair net some labs you can like eat a cheeseburger while you're standing there like people there's a huge difference no matter where you go now you mentioned genetic engineering earlier and that's an interest in mine and something i'm learning and studying right now and you know genetic engineering for a lot of agricultural products really is mainly selective breeding it's something we've been doing for thousands of years and it works really well but in canada the cannabis industry there's definitely been some some cutting edge research going on in things like engineering yeast to produce cannabinoids and fermenting lots of yeast to produce these do you follow any of that at all do what do you think about some of those i do and it's all fascinating especially for the analytical applications because if i want to study a novel cannabinoid like thcv right so there's like two or three genetics that produce whole numbers of percentage points of thcb at all right and then to go in and extract those and isolate that thcb down would be costly and so then that makes researching what is this thcv and what does it do really difficult because we also don't have standard academic grants and so this is all private funding and um i can't tell you if you can monetize this information about this novel can of annoying until i look at it and learn some things so um being able to just make it is clearly the superior answer for that type of analytical environment because i have so much cost that is just sunk on isolating that from elsewhere um that's also where you see a lot of these cannabinoids get a little bit of hype and fame that's why you heard a lot about cbg this last year is because cbd was hot before that and um you know and so now if i want to make more money i want to promote a different cannabinoid and so the fact that there was less cbg available made it more valuable um you know and so we're going to keep seeing that with the discovery of new cannabinoids and and so being able to just grow them to be able to study them is huge um but it doesn't compete with just growing in the field yet and it only produces that candle and so the medical market has insisted on you know this full spectrum broad spectrum type of definition for a really long time because the medical market grew out of black market the medical market grew out of we don't have a it's a bag from a guy it's weak you know there was a name um you know the medical market grew from people who were handling it themselves so you know they didn't want someone else to grow it and analyze it for them they said this is my weed that i grew and that made it the best and so um you know so the medical market has never really demanded that type of product they've always demanded the diversity that comes from just growing whatever and the recreational market has come with a lot of compromises and the recreational market definitely has led to more of that you know cbd isolate type of product because it's easy and economical to produce it makes it widely available to everyone but it's not complex and so now that marketing problem comes into play of like how do i sell another cbd you know like do i get a different shaped bottle a revolutionary dropper you know like it starts to not become about cannabinoid anymore and so the agricultural product will always have that advantage over growing it in a dish because nature does whatever it wants we are very preventable even if you try to have unique ideas with the same ideas a lot whereas nature will just do crazy things you know like you can wear clones and still have a variegated one for no reason out of nowhere and uh that's nature so we can't really compete with that and so far the consumer has not requested the type of sterile product that you know um massive pharmaceutical production of cannabinoids would really call for yeah i do wonder if in the future we're gonna see you know because there's been so much hype with cbd in the last several years and all there's all these new products that have come to market i wonder if in the future we're going to start just seeing that line of products that cannabinoid products continue to grow and uh enter into the public sphere one of the things i wanted to touch on before we close out here was it you mentioned uh you sort of talk about chemistry as is like it's not it's real chemistry but there's there's something like holding it back from its real possibilities i wonder if you could talk a little bit about that you know i think we're we're probably in the next five years i would guess it's going to be federally legalized i think everybody sort of feels that way and i think it's even going to be voted on in the next week or two potentially if it makes it to the floor um how does that impact like the people that are in the industry and also just how it operates in general one of the things you mentioned was there's all these differences between the standards and the codes and the regulations clearly there's got to be some advantages for that to be consolidated and and being standardized across the board there's also something to be said i guess about the flexibility at the local level um like when this thing gets legalized how do you think that's going to impact what it is that you do the extraction part of it and how how it's operated and how it's run it's um it's going to be really interesting it depends on which direction that legalization goes for starters um the type of rules i'm going to have to deal with if i'm governed by the atf is very different than who i would deal with if i'm governed by the fda for example right like the fda isn't telling you know joule what kind of mango to use in their paws they're coming out later and saying hey that mango stuff is full pesticide stop you know so it's a different um type of industrial experience uh depending on who's in charge and it could really go a lot of different directions but i think that in either of those cases one thing that we'll see probably no matter what will be a change to that you know entrance barrier to the industry so right now it's very easy to get an entry level job anywhere and just walk in and learn how to extract um kind of apprentice style meaning that you're just trained by someone else who knows the thing uh and so there's not really there's not a degree that's required there's not um you know any kind of traditional trajectory for that type of education there's no onboarding you might fill out your w-4 the first day and maybe not you know like there's uh there's not consistency in that um experience for employees and so on the positive it means it's very easy for you to walk in with no experience and work your way up um in a company and get to the top which is you know something i'm a huge fan of because it's how i got involved in this industry but at the same time it means that i can walk in get an entry-level job in a scary dungeon of mystery combustibles and very dangerous work environments and i could be trained by someone with limited experience and they can put me in an unsafe situation and at the end of it i won't know any better and maybe i'll be stuck repeating that process you know if you're multiple companies and being treated poorly because if i'm used to work somewhere for six months get a pay raise that's not how you know these mom and pop startups work you know um if i'm used to someone always training me to use a cash register before asking me to bring up a sale that's not how the lab works if someone says can you write all that down and you've never used a rollo and you say yes good luck uh there's so there's so much opportunity which goes and uh you know that that is going to be a big change with federal legalization as well you know so it will get safer for employees to operate um but that will also mean that uh it will become more expensive for business owners to uh start their business it's already gotten so expensive yeah that's gonna change the type of business owners that you have yeah um so you're not gonna be able to say you know i'm murphy and i would love to just make live resin because it's my favorite and go and meet people who want to do that and start a business you know with everyone pooling their savings that's what we can do now that's not going to be the case when we have the type of uh infrastructure that osha and federal regulation will impose on now we're a fighter now you know yeah the barrier entry will be so high that it only lends itself to these big corporations with deep pockets and yeah um and also that kind of eliminates the entrepreneurial aspect which is kind of a big way that so many people got started in the cannabis industry and a big big believer in small business and just supporting entrepreneurs and and piggybacking on to that question we are seeing a wave of ex cultural acceptance and in legalization that appears to be happening much quicker than medical marijuana in psychedelics in the psychedelic space have you are any of your growers looking at this space and thinking about like hey this might be a new market we need to start thinking about this right now yeah so i think that that um that wave of popularity is directly a result of the corporate shift in cannabis because as many of the entrepreneurial growers who were making money in cannabis are getting pushed out of the legal framework especially in places like say california and on the west coast where that barrier ventures getting very high and the profits involved are not non-existent we're seeing these entrepreneurial growers take their skills and apply them elsewhere and so it's the same people who are fighting for medical and recreational cannabis that are saying yeah mushrooms too let's have it all you know um it's the same people who are um you know behind a lot of that and i think that we're going to continue to see it grow because you know i i i used to say this started with gay marriage right but like states that have gay marriage get medical marijuana first um and so there's just a point where people decide that like what you do is fine whether i do it or not you know it's kind of this like general acceptance of freedom um more so than anything about the product you know you don't have to be gay or married to support gay marriage you don't have to use cannabis to support medical marijuana um you want to eat mushrooms to be fine with josh growing mushrooms you know like i think that there's this change in um people just being comfortable with like letting their neighbors live their lives and not criminalizing our behavior um and so you know we're gonna see a lot more things be more widely accepted uh things like you know the mushroom development is really exciting because it brings that entrepreneurial um aspect back into it but then we look at you know like therapy options for mdma which is also very exciting but that goes back to our pharmaceutical world and a little bit different type of environment with you know different barriers for entries so there's another company that i know that's also doing mescaline which is cactus based so there's like all this whole class of psychedelics many of them come from the various plants that are already around so if i were a cannabis business owner i definitely would be looking at psychedelics and me thinking thinking ahead because probably in five years if you go to extraction equipment sites right now um you will see mushrooms floor kits for sale as well oh yeah the crossover is right there it's the same people and they are all down there's people turning those um storage containers that were for uh little portable growers and they're just flipping that into a mushroom room because it's obviously the same requirements um just different settings you know absolutely that's really really interesting murphy this was awesome i've learned a ton about cannabis that i had no idea about it so it's kind of really there's like a little kid in me that's just happy i get to talk to someone who's so knowledgeable knowledgeable about the field plus it's so cool to meet another diy person i say diy you're kind of self-taught i'm a huge advocate for project-based hands-on learning which it sounds like you're also an advocate of and uh so it's really cool it sounds like you've been incredibly successful in this field so it's uh it's it's very cool to get a chance to talk to you so thank you thank you for having me on oh thanks thanks for having good questions i loved it yeah yeah for sure so people want to get a hold of you if someone wants to hire you to come build out their extraction plan how do they how do they get ahold of you um so uh my private consulting um the easiest way to access me is through the links on my instagram at murphy murray or at moore faster which is my consulting um you can also uh find me at a lot of the different cannabis industry pages and then also through the good life gang which is uh you know kind of a diy open source community um it's good light uh good food uh good hash and good people is our our motto and um through the go back gang our goal is to just promote that entrepreneurial um you know community base for this plant because we are afraid to lose it and um the quebec gang is just a whole bunch of vetted consultants and vendors for our industry that are committed to um being you know open with our technology and our processes uh as well as just supporting each other and being cool people very cool very cool so everybody go check that out check out her instagram because it's full of really cool scientific scientific stuff and uh really like amazing equipment that i've never seen before but also all those things that we're talking about the terpenes and the crystals and you show that stuff i had no idea that so many different things can be extracted into different formats from cannabis so it's really really interesting well murphy thank you again and uh i really look forward to chatting with you again soon have a good one bye", "1O5OkUxdHoU": "hey guys happy first day of summer today I'm going to talk about our impulsive behaviors in relation to borderline personality disorder and a couple of reasons why I believe it is that we turn to these impulsive behaviors and a couple of examples and also why that could lead to potential addiction whether it be substance abuse food eating disorders spending disorders anything like that they all fall under the same category of addiction so why is it that we turn to these impulsive behaviors there's people that don't have for my personality disorder it is really like they don't understand why that is or or why we do that and why so like second nature why we don't think about anything else we just have to immediately be like okay I got to do something impulsive right now to relieve myself so the first part of this impulsive behavior is the original thing that happens to us that makes us want to go and do it so something happens that is extremely negative and we then have to rid our consciousness of it so we need that immediate like gratification we need something that is going to divert all of our attention to something else and unfortunately a lot of these impulses are negative and the reason that is I believe is because it needs to be something huge and like something really impactful for us to not think about what it is that just happened so something really negative that could happen to be we could have got into an argument with someone we really care about like some like big fight we could find out some really upsetting news it could be like a desk something like really serious in our mind so something may not be serious to the outside world you could be wondering like why why are they so upset by this but in our head at that moment in time it is really really a thing us and that's why we need to get away from it we need to do anything in our power to to not have this weighing down on us since we have the black of my thinking we can't think about anything positive at that moment is just oh my god pick this negative thing just happened I don't know how I'm going to get past this at this point in time all I can see and all I can think about is just this negativity and I don't see myself getting over it I mean usually we do yes eventually get over it but in our heads that's all we can think about and that's why we turn to these behaviors we're like okay we need to either you know go get drunk because that will put us in a different mood you know we need to do drugs we need to go speed recklessly we need to go spend much money we need to binge eat you know maybe engage in sex and since it's impulsive we're not thinking about it that usually means that it's going to be unsafe sex something that is immediate and it's gratifying something that will boost our moods so we're no longer thinking about this awful awful thing that just happened so that is what can lead us to an addiction it was there for us when we were down when we're feeling so negative that we need to you know now all that's all we're thinking about the next time we're negative or in the bad next time we're just thinking okay well it worked for me last time it got me out of this state diamond let's go do again you know let's go get drunk because last time I was drunk I wasn't thinking about it obviously when you're no longer drunk or high or when you're no longer doing that impulsive behavior like you're Lou goes back to the way it was and you know most of time even worse than before he was on it but in our minds that it's just that one thing it's not like a multitude of things that we can think about and you know going from a walk in the park or I'm talking to a person is is not usually something that's enough it's not enough for us to divert our attention to to the other thing like that negative thing is so overpowering that we cannot think about anything else they cannot get past it until we engage in these impulses and this has been a system that has been going on in our lives throughout our entire lives even though your children to a certain extent these impulsive behaviors have been with us for our whole lives and so we don't know anything else we need to do these things because that's all we know so that's why we need to find obviously puns of coping mechanisms but it's not always that easy when we're in that pit of the despair you know alcohol or drugs or whatever it is that we usually take our impulses out on that's usually the one thing that's there for us and it is hard for us to have these meaningful positive relationships that we can count on so sometimes the substance is all that we have and it is super easy for us to then get an addiction we have addictive personalities we have the black in my thinking we have like that one mindset we have like okay music at Heights can we get drunk it's always on our minds because you know that was there for us that's what made us better that's what took us away from that negative state and once you have an addiction your other mental illnesses and your other mental problems are not usually looked at because medical professionals are not sure whether it's you know the substance talking or if it's the underlying problems so they usually try and treat that first and then you're no longer able to be treated for you know your boiler it's not a disorder or whatever it is so it makes it so much harder it just adds on to it and then once you're finished you know once you're no longer high or drunk or once you're finished with the sex you usually have like even worse of a mood so then it's a cycle you know you're in that negative state you need to go and get high you're drunk for example and you're done with it and Irene even worse state and then you have to go and do it again then you're done with it you have to do it again back and forth back and forth and breaking this cycle is so so so difficult so that's a little bit of why I believe that we have the compulsive behaviors and why it is so easy for us to have an addictive personality and then engage in these addictions and then you know abuse substances alcohol engagement unsafe sex you know all of these things and eating disorders as well because bulimia for example it's all about the impulses eating a bunch and then feeling [ __ ] for it and then we need to throw up and these cycles are super super hard to break so if you guys also struggle with some sort of addiction let me know it is super super common but it's not usually talked about because again once you have an addiction that's kind of like the primary concern and it's not usually like a co-current thing so you can BPD as all addiction or dvd as well as eating disorder and BPD is the primary primary reason why we engage with youth addiction wazzup so sorry my boy so that's a little bit about oil and personality disorder and our impulsive behavior leave me a like or comment down below thank you guys so much and I'll see you can see", "UPNtugPUdfw": "[Music] welcome to a tech moment on cannabis tech i'm your host christina etter in this podcast we take just a few minutes to talk about some of the exciting science and technology that's happening in and around the cannabis and hemp industries and today we're going to talk about extractions now the market for cannabis extractions has come a long way in the last several years and the technology and the science behind these products is continually evolving and changing cannabis extractions and and all of the processes that are behind these products and to keep up with demand so scaling cannabis extractions can also be extremely difficult for a lot of cannabis producers and trying to get this product out to market so my guest today has actually had a pivotal role in the evolution of cannabis concentrates dr daniel hayden has a phd in molecular plant physiology and he started this journey to perfect cannabis extractions about 25 years ago as a pioneer in the world of extractions dr daniel hayden actually invented high terpene full spectrum extract or what we know as htfse using his very own extraction method called co-solvent technology so welcome to the show dr hayden i am excited to have this conversation thank you it's great to be here and um yes we invented hdfsc and i've been working since 1994 but in plant molecular physiology more or less once it went legal in colorado which you're from i decided to move from the private sector and science into cannabis so about 10 years now we've been doing this co-solvent tech with cannabis fantastic and that's actually a great segue into my first question because i really want to hear more about this process you know what kind of led you down this path into making these making these cannabis extractions so yeah a little bit more about my background was when i got to graduate school i had to work on antheriums which is a very difficult tropical plant it looks like a heart-shaped flower with a space coming out and this plant was like plastic and so there was all these conventional means for the extraction of nucleic acids and when i tried those it acted very bizarre and so i had to go back into 1950s and 1940s technology and chemistry and learn how to extract nucleic acids without extracting phenolics and carbohydrates and lipids and that was most of my phd actually and then when cannabis came along i was frustrated with early attempts rso some bubble hash back in the 2000s we did start doing butane it wasn't enough and finally with this addition of co2 alongside the butane it finally started making sense and it reminded me of my extraction in my phd days um the whole process and so then it was just about being a scientist and using what i've learned my entire career kind of optimized the extraction technology so briefly we just exposed the plant material to co2 it's not super critical we don't run it with the co2 we just bathe it more or less in co2 and that kind of imbues itself into the resin and almost carbonates it like a soft drink and then we do a butane extraction very cold and the resin will continue to maintain that co2 inside of it and you know there's some chemic chemistry along the way but just natural chemistry gravity pressure time temperature uh and then what we result in is a great resin from that kind of pairing of carbon dioxide and solvent extractions and so my background working with all different types of solvents during my degree and radioactivity and all sorts of different things i become a specialist and hazardous waste management and working with solvents and there's just a perfect kind of marriage between a natural plant product which is why i got into the field to plant molecular physiology and cannabis it worked well together absolutely now i love the the the talk about the using different um solvents or that you're using the co2 in conjunction with the butane and and the effect that you get from that now one of the things that i want to talk about in your philosophy in terms of cannabis extraction however is that you definitely believe that curing cannabis first is the best way to go and making cannabis extractions where like live resins and things made from the wrong plant material may not be as as beneficial do you want to talk about that a little bit sure i come from plant molecular physiology and my work was on senescence which in plants that means apoptosis cell death in plants there's a recycling of nutrients to the seeds into healthier portions of the plant because they can't get up and move and gather nutrients like mammals can they're stuck in the ground so they really have to reduce recycle and reuse and so cured when we talk about cannabis is actually just a ripened fruit we eat ripened fruit not only ripened fruit but tree-ripened fruit and vegetables grown on we know all know of as better tasting than something that's picked unripe and kind of allowed to ripen on your shelf and so cannabis goes much through this aging process during curing it's a critical plant biology process and it's evolved in every other seeds wheat plants it all goes through a process of curing consolidation of the biochemistry in every plant and so curing is a process of cannabis that we can not go without and right now um living resins have kind of taken the storm taken the country by storm and this is kind of an unripe perfume type of resin that doesn't have the time and complexity put to it like a cured resin would have and really um what has happened is the living resident is much easier to extract it's much easier to commercialize it's much easier to build bigger and bigger machines and process bigger and bigger lots and make the numbers in this type of cannabis so when they see cured resin and it's difficult to work with like my plants when i was working on tropical plants in my phd and like cured cannabis it's very difficult you have to do the process correctly when you do it you get the bountiful all the bountiful resin that like a cured flower everybody has already experienced does have and it moves away from that perfume really quick euphoric effect to a more sedative longer term um effect when you use cured resins correctly but you're i'm on here to tell you about extractions so you you can get cured resin right now but it's either remediated beyond all recognition or i mean put through clays or distillates um or you can get a live resin um you can't really get the product we're producing which unless you unless you have the flower really or you're sitting with the person who made the hash and you experience it with him so those are the only real ways you would get cured resin these days interesting that that's just absolutely fascinating to me and you know it's just fascinating i think in general to see the different products and and how the industry is evolving and with people like you with your expertise getting involved you know we're learning more about the plant we're learning more about how to make it most beneficial to be most efficient you know into to create the compounds that are really going to be useful within the industry so it's absolutely fascinating to hear you talk about it about cured plant versus life plan and that in that way now so now that you're talking about the product that you actually create let's talk about that a little bit and kind of how did you take all of this expertise and then transform it into your company your extractioneering there in oregon well it it was based on being involved with cannabis my entire life and really respecting the plant and understanding what it is and then having those views be under siege continuously by outside forces and then that's just how i learned to live with it and so um when we formed extraction hearing um we were just playing around it was a eureka moment when we added the co2 and the butane together and it was really me following the moment everybody else transitioned to kind of machines that other people built and that they were generally used and those kind of help them safely extract and since i had the experience in my scientific life i i could choose to be competent enough with what i was working with work with co2 and butane and we went i went in that path and then i met my lovely wife and she has skills for marketing and seo and websites online commerce her parents are all in it and social media and so really her expression about what we made true to the plant true to cured resin and she was able to express it with packaging and everything that came from her kind of approach and so that kind of marriage both in actual man and woman marriage and marriage together formed extractioneering which was just all about trying to get the farmers involved and the patients involved and so the farmers make the resin we don't make it we just extract it correctly and then the patients interpret the resin if they don't rely on sativa or indica so they'll use resins for certain purpose and if we can understand where it comes from and all the identity about it then we can have reliable experiences that they can give us feedback in reverse and so we're trying to really reconnect ideas about how people are using cannabis and then get the farmers to make certain strains for that that's fantastic no i love that approach and you know it really is i think for everyone not just farmers or not just entrepreneurs or extractors and consume just consumers in general i think it really is a matter of better understanding the plant better understanding how to use it how my term that i like to use is using it with intent you know there's there's we've all been taught from our days in college or maybe from an older brother how to use cannabis that's that's something that recreationally people have been doing for forever but learning how to use cannabis with intent and with purpose is a whole different ball game and i think that education and understanding those those um connections between what works for some people and what doesn't and letting the consumers go through that process of finding it is absolutely critical as a professional in the industry and obviously you've been doing this for quite some time now and and you've kind of seen the different evolution of products what do you see in the future you know what what are you looking forward to in the coming year or maybe the coming five years in in cannabis extractions well it took us a while to get to market we really wanted to honor the system the legal system uh you know but that kind of broke our backs because we didn't take investment you know we had to lead our own path with our own mission um so i'm hoping right now today is a moment but that the word gets out that there's a more authentic type of extraction experience and that we have to move back towards cured resin and start believing in some darker products don't necessarily hurt the process and start chasing kind of thc percentage and kind of hopefully mary where hemp farmers are now and where thc cannabis farmers are now kind of pull them into cured cannabis and different cannabinoids in actual vaporizable smokeable or extractable means and products and not kind of split off into 10 different groups pharma synthetic you know ratios very specific cannabinoids purify but more or less consolidate the spirit of what people are trying to do in cultivating cannabis and make those cannabinoid ratios and expressions in breeding and execution and not to be afraid of thc you know on both thc and not to be afraid of it but inclusive um and it's funny of course about um diversity and everything like that is you know i think thc has been oppressed i think cannabis has been a press this is the social equity that we need or are these two substances um black white all different colors you can possibly be um we're just talking about cannabis still being oppressed and thcs still being vilified so um we have to learn how you know to reincorporate those back into this whole industry right you know i can't agree with that more just in the last few years that i've been a part of the industry and and uh coming from the midwest and then relocating out here to colorado it's just very fascinating to me to to hear their stories and how how badly cannabis is still villainized out in the in the midwest in iowa in in in minneapolis or minnesota in that area it's just very very fascinating to me and you know even here recently in colorado there in denver a lawmaker up there is is talking about introducing this bill to kind of limit thc content and products i'd love to hear your perspective on that and why that could be such a problem i'm gathering two sides of this edibles or just vaporizable products um he vaporizable products is just not an understanding of the science he doesn't want like um a hundred percent but he's okay with thirty percent um that's just flawed science and thinking um as far as what we're talking about the thc percentage and edibles um i do have i want to move forward with that and i would prefer even if i have a raw virgin extract from the plants and i melt it into some coconut oil and i make a batch that's reliable that the patients love for sleeping um i want to put that in a capsule because capsules nobody just takes random capsules and everybody understands what comes in capsules is more like a medication and then in that form i feel you can increase the thc potency milligrams up to any milligram you kind of want because again it's not going to get confused for a gummy or cookie or chocolate by people who don't want to be using it they're not going to have a capsule and say oh might as well throw this down my throat um and so i think treating cannabis like somebody may accidentally ingest it who doesn't want it for the edible portion is is should be capsulized and then if we want a food experience with cannabis uh an in-person event a savory type of event or you buy a bottle of olive oil and you go home with purpose and cook a meal and finish it up and you know this is more of a sound practice with thc edibles than the gummy the chocolate but as far as like an extractable cartridge you can't have a cartridge over 75 thc because it causes brain damage i mean i don't support this at all and if i had a agency that was a collective effort i would attack it right away and so that leads us to say you talked about a lawmaker making choices for us so in california 38 million people a single lawmaker said ban on smokeable hemp and so he made that decision for 38 million californians and this is because in cannabis we're not collectively bargained so together we have to join together and say we are not alcohol we are cannabis we drive on cannabis we use cannabis in social situations we are not intoxicated or high on cannabis this is a health and wellness product it's a phytonutrient that we nourish our bodies with in different ways people can take too much but people can drink too much too much sugar be too sleepy you know so these are we have to collectively bargain this if we let people again attack it based on personal pride out there it's because we're fragmented and everybody's gathering up everything for themselves and not collectively joining together [Applause] no that's and that's a great viewpoint and and you're right it's we have this opportunity i think right now with the industry as young as it is to kind of um mold how we want this to grow and and you're right we have to start coming together as a collective and saying no we need to to um attack these limitations head on you know i i'm glad that you brought up the smokeable ham thing because that's something actually that's been on my mind a lot lately i just recently discovered how many states actually have bans on smokable hemp and i was absolutely appalled i i absolutely couldn't believe that that just because they don't want to legalize cannabis they're they're banning this this other benign relatively benign product so it's really interesting to me to see how this is all all kind of coming to fruition and i'm hoping that maybe the legislation changes you know in the next couple of years may may help to change some of that and and and create maybe a more level playing field for the cannabis and hemp industries yeah just briefly it's because we're not collectively bargained so it is a very i don't know the right racist trope to ban a smokeable substance it's a very racial type of attack on this substance and they also want to say medicine is not smoked and they want to make it they want to give it to the pharmaceutical industry to dispense in purified ways and we want to keep it as a phytonutrient and we have evolved with the plants as a inhalable ingestible product and the compounds in it that are vaporized during that event are fully you know taken up into the blood as they should be and are able to cross the blood-brain barrier when we eat it some of it is true but a lot of those compounds are lost through digestion and so we never evolved with that practice we evolved with a inhalation practice so if they want to win me over in the ban on things they can pursue better ways more protectable ways to vaporize this product they can assist companies to help them do that they can tell the public which companies have devices that you know are approved for the vaporization and inhalable actions of hemp and cannabis rather than just straight up saying medicine isn't inhaled and then giving somebody an inhaler that's propelled by butane for asthma you know so you so it's very frustrating there right right good point on the inhaler the inhalers i i hadn't even made that connection so that's that's such a great point so talk to me a little bit about how anybody watching this podcast today can actually get in touch with you i understand that you also do kind of in speaking engagements and i mean obviously you're a great advocate for for this industry so do do you have anything upcoming that you want to mention or how can people get a hold of you if they want to get in touch with you people i got my pr guy lucas he's great and um really in 2021 we decided to start to move forward with a lot more conversations in in place and before that we what we do is wonderful so we kind of romance ourselves in these halls with our products and it took a while to get to licensing and so we thought we were going to grow from the ground up through reputation of our products but the industry when we landed on licensing has changed it had changed from when we started licensing to when we landed and so lost was a lot of that cured resin perspective that we had and so through all these talks people can schedule we want to bring the concept of that back and discussion so that's what we're here to do fantastic well you know i appreciate your time today so much and for coming on the show we love to talk to the experts in the industry and clearly you're one of those experts so we really appreciate your time today and we look forward to your continued innovation in the industry and more products to come from extractioneering thank you very much", "RGoeJfCsZsA": "we're fixing corporation August 9 2018 we have a CP for screw pressing we're gonna test again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you get this and this oil right here get this then use our press-on material", "Icr8ABpRIU0": "right now we go over running up dried material and loading the extraction vessel so here's some dried up material it's not fine enough we want something more like coffee grounds or sugar so I'm going throw it over here in my food processor we've got the material in the food processor we're going to grind it down to coffee grounds consistency you can use a food processor a ninja blender also works good take a people click so that's pretty good I prefer to go a little bit a little bit finer than that that's like a really thick coffee ground we're gonna try to go once or two espresso do not want powder baby powder is too fine powdered sugar is too fine that is perfect I'm gonna take a look at that something like that almost like a coarse coffee ground now we're come over here to the extraction vessel so let's clean off this ring here make sure you've got material along though ring so the first thing you use hand tight Melanie's get them all down get stubborn one like that one don't worry about it when your impact get him down try to get mom hand tighten grab your impact now we don't want to over tighten any of these that's what the over engineers for first number one down to a store pattern there's no you should never sit here and overdo it there's no ring in there you don't want to smash it same with this over here this gaskets on here you want that eight to sixteenth inch spacing in here like I've got put metal the metal you're going to crush the gaskets in the separators the bottom down here I typically use a dry vac to suck out all my material in here so I almost never open up the bottom occasion I'll check this mixture another loose if you never open it you don't need to torque it down every time on the larger system a leader a lot of people don't have a drive back home long enough to suck out all the material so they will take off these bolts on the bottom and empty up the material in their extractor", "sTf81b1wjzg": "[Music] you",

the world serving legal cannabis markets previously sean was vp chief of staff for energy policy for tesla and solar city he's proud to serve on the heads visiting council for williston and lives in brooklyn new york he has never turned down a slice of key lime pie so with that we're going to turn the evening over to sean and tory and ask them to start off by just saying a little bit about the path that they took from williston to here so you guys can unmute and jump on in sorry you want to take first stab yeah sure and thanks so much jill for those great introductions uh well i mean i graduated in class of 10 so i just i'm going to be having my 10-year reunion all remote this year so my path has been pretty short and full of connections i know sean and i have talked a lot about networking and that's how i got from williston to ithaca ithaca to politics and politics to cannabis and you know so i think like what's most important to know about me is my rebellious leadership style and just always getting out there meeting people talking to people and you know not saying no to anything pretty much that's how i ended up with students for sensible drug policy it's how i ended up in my career in politics and how i ended up actually with this all remote team nissanco with cannabis pr and seo focused and so now i'm director of operations there it's an all remote team so if anyone has questions about remote lifestyle now that you've probably most of you have done it for the last year happy to have any side conversations about that after this and what's really important too is my focus with advocacy marketing and public relations in the cannabis space the industry has obviously changed a lot since 2011 when i began my career as a canvas cannabis advocate and new states have come online from ballot initiatives and more recently via state legislatures and forever there's those like whispers of federal legalization just around the corner so just teasing a little bit of how uh what's to come so sean i'll toss it over to you oh thank you so much i feel like you're the auntie nancy reagan you're you're a just say yes person i don't like that um i graduated wilson 98 and you know went to hartwick college um i thought i wanted to be an actor um but it turns out that what i really wanted to do was just do econometrics all the time um and that actually proved not to be the case what i really wanted to do was be a lobbyist um after i left uh the university of ethics i came back not really knowing what i wanted to do i knew i cared a lot about the environment um as niels knows i believe that this is our earth and uh that it should be uh protected as such uh so i spent most of my career uh at the early stages of my um the early stages of my career um in non-profit advocacy uh on behalf of clean energy um and from there i i ended up at a solar energy company um solar city which was of course acquired by tesla and after about 15 years in that sector i wanted to try something different um it was about 2017 and um i i literally saw a sign um that told me where i should go next was that we've mapped out these billboards that had the all these facts about um trying to change the narrative around the discussion around cannabis cannabis policy and implementation and i was like that seems interesting and i just sort of cold called them and here i am um three years later um i think the the defining thread uh through all this is and something that i i really do strongly want to reinforce that through wilson tools that wilson has sort of gave me was the challenging of the status quo that um you know the ridiculousness of our built infrastructure and still relying so heavily on fossil fuel it never stopped right with me and and that it needed to be shifted and the ridiculousness of being able to buy you know a six pack of white claw not knocking not white claw anywhere you want but um we're still incarcerating uh tens of thousands of people on the daily uh in this country for something that i i think we all can agree we've probably some of us may have taken trips down to the manhattan to uh enjoy uh at some point or another so um and you know williston certainly was a a place that uh encouraged me and my peers to challenge assumptions and um go go against grain and um let me hear so i got hopefully that wraps that up nicely heck yeah i definitely think so and i'll i'll echo that as well i mean that's where my rebellion certainly started that's how i ended up in williston was through rebellion and wilson help me channel that into a productive sense and to build on pond leadership so definitely shout out though i think totally well i think that we wanted to get started maybe giving some framing for folks as to the regulatory path of how we got to where we are and how we might get to where we're going next so sean i'll toss that over to you since you are the policy expert here sure i sit on the east coast uh part of our team um i i kind of in charge of everything that kind of touches the eastern seaboard for the most part and uh federal policy and canada um and by and large you know what we have mostly seen up to this point is that it's it's gone through the ballot and those ballots by and large are overwhelmingly popular i mean uh public polling and just the poll that matters the most um is the final one of the vote people turn out in droves uh this last run was no exception on more than 11 ballots measures all of them passed including um [Music] one of the dakotas geez it's it's blank me right now sal's gonna catch me on this uh the south one right yes south dakota did both medical and uh recreational in one fell swoop uh of course they're getting challenged in court a little bit right now and the governor's not being very helpful with that but um it's clear that this is extremely popular usually what happens is there's a medical program that gets installed and then a few years later after that some of that stigma has been reduced um a a adult use as we like to call it um comes comes forward that gap is is narrowing i mean people are going straight to adult use now um though when 40 states there's a medical program already in the country so um we also like to say that in more than a third of the country uh it operates under some legal cannabis structure um so that's really moving things the federal level we've started to exhaust a lot of those ballot initiatives i mean they're not all done i think there's more to be done in say florida for instance but uh obviously extremely expensive there but we're now starting to get to the states where um doubt measures just aren't an option particularly in the northeast where you have an old um you know colonial style of government where everything has to be done at state houses and it is significantly more difficult there and i think a really good example of that was the ballot initiative but it was really technically a constitutional amendment in new jersey last year and that passed with 67 percent of the vote from new jersey and did not lose a single county and only two municipalities uh in the 500 plus that are in the garden state only two municipalities had less than the 50 threshold so that that overwhelming pass and then it had to be implemented by the legislature and they took six months to do it i mean they could not have a clear indication that people were for this and yet we're still dragging their heels so i think one of those things is i mean the average age of a united states senator is plus 62 years old now i'm not saying anything about our older alumni here i'm just saying that that is generations of the talking dog and uh nancy raikkonen uh i i paid attention all those things to the as a kid and it's really ingrained in these people and they're they're really worried and about the pushback and it's not so much that they can see those numbers um but we have conversations they still use the old troops uh gateway drug uh you know what are we gonna do about intoxicated driving well what are you doing about it now um because it's certainly happening now and if you think it's not uh i've got a bridge in brooklyn to sell you um so that's kind of the next frontier and then just to touch on the federal not toss it back to the utori for anything that ad that i've missed is you know on the federal level um we're all kind of operating i know south south pace class of 95 is here is the the president um uh and of the board at the marijuana policy project um and certainly seem the same is that you know these states start to add up to a whole country and so movement at the federal level does seem to be more imminent than it was i don't think it's quite as easy as some of maybe the vc folks are reporting on it right now um but there's probably two steps to that something like the safe banking act which would give protections to states who already have a legal legal infrastructure to access federal um federal credit and loans and not be hindered for operating with a illegal substance at the federal level so that would probably be the first step and and the one after that is something that looks more like the more act um which is a much more robust um legalization program for the entire country that has passed already in the house but um obviously on by mostly bipartisan lines although if you um do supports uh from from republican uh house members on that um and i think i i can't prognosticate about timeline i mean if it's going to happen soon it happens quick now um schumer and booker are getting on this now um but if it's going to take a little longer one of the challenges there and there are smart people on the call that could correct my thinking is if necessary but um this is a turnout the vote thing for 2022. right and and and democrats want to keep that as an issue and a hot button issue and if they solve everything well it's hard to turn supporters out so so that actually is something to think about um and some republicans are coming along uh the you know um steve james has moved uh into the the former corey gardner role uh former republican senator from colorado who who lost dank and looper um but uh steve james has started to take up his mantle as sort of the republican champion on this um montana's moving forward where they're legally legalization efforts so um it will definitely be very exciting um it will either be really quick or very slow right somewhere and nowhere in between nice yeah that definitely feels like what's going to be happening they can't you know give it all away so soon especially after 2020 with all those ballot initiatives passed it was such a big win that they feel like you know we could probably ride this high for a little bit longer before they've gotta dangle this this chance in front of us it's interesting so i'm from massachusetts from western mass actually but i live in colorado now and it's been you know pretty pretty easy going here having legalization we have the ballot initiative process which is how that this a whole thing kicked off in 2012 and we're slowly running out of states as sean had mentioned that actually have the ballot initiative process at which point especially in the northeast things are going to be turning to what we saw like in virginia where it's a simple yes or no vote to legalize and then they're going to hammer out the details later and so you might be seeing more states coming online vermont did this as well where it's like yes weed is legal and now all of a sudden there's this gray area where there's no regulations and we're just going to exist in this until it's important enough for us to actually do something about it and so i just want to you know give that caveat that just because legalization is happening doesn't mean that a legal market in that state is actually around the corner um does mean though if you've got capital to invest in real estate that before that vote comes you should invest in that real estate hold on to it because that's something they've been seeing especially in new york with prices and real estate just going through the roof because they're talking about legalization which they have been for a little while and who knows now with cuomo what's actually going to happen there uh let's see another thing important thing to bring up is like this piecemeal approach that we've been going on as we legalize with states there are pros and cons to it you know each state has been able to craft a system that's going to work kind of best for them and they're able to adjust it you know there's not like one size fits all but it then can actually put some protections in place that federal efforts might overlook and sean had brought this up when we were discussing earlier but there are you know communities are able to then regulate as they see fit and so sean feel free to correct me if i miss speaking about northampton for example but when massachusetts passed massachusetts enacted a three percent community impact fee and after i think that was 2016 so after basically four years after the legalization vote they realized that the impact actually wasn't as much as they thought so northampton was able to drop that fee able to basically lessen taxes allow more disproportionately affected communities to actually get in because the barrier and the cost to entry is lower yeah that's right and a couple of really important things that you brought up there tori is like i think to get to our next uh topic is just social equity in the space it is crucial uh it is the it is the most talked about and important aspect of moving forward and one of the challenges of this space and massachusetts is probably the best example of of it all and you mentioned impact fee and they put a lot of restrictions on um actually getting open the licensing process has been exceedingly slow and so there's that there's a lot of barriers in terms of negotiating a contract with the town of where you can cite and locate you actually have to hold on to the real estate um and if you're talking about the boston metropolitan area you're talking in excess of oh easily fifty thousand dollars a month to secure uh at the bottom to secure space and you'll have to secure that before you have any any hope of operation so in most cases at a minimum that's six months um in others it's um even longer i know i saw i think jason songs coming on i i know he's working through a location of lee mass that where they're trying to secure the site all that and have to go through all this community fighting and planning and so then if you think about some of the communities that have the less access to capital and let's pathways this let's think consider the fact that um with the exception of a few credit agencies within the state credit unions and like that it's hard to get loan and financing in this and they they certainly take the those who are investing are taking a significant premium um you know north of 10 10 um on some of those business loans which is exceedingly high and so it makes it very very very challenging and so when you think about communities that have access to that type of capital it by and large disproportionately not inclusive and it's one of the big challenges especially if we regulate we understand that states are dipping their toe in and feeling very much like well wow we don't want a free-for-all on this cannabis stuff but by in so doing they're making it even harder for um people to participate and um have a meaningful pathway forward so it's really something that um goes along with all this i mean it's it's not as simple as the yes no questions as torrey pointed out if it really the details of this okay yes and and we'll have this but if there's no state supplied um loan fund funding low or no interest loans or not not just for outright grants it's pretty hard to find funding to secure the the capital to secure location and then get the lawyer fees to fight and work through these post-community agreements um zoning boards um then have you know 30 just like busy body neighbors who are like i don't want a weed shop here and you know i want this place to look like it looked when herman melville wrote moby dick and i bought it here you can be like that and you're like can you can we all like calm down please and um have a little bit more of a reasonable approach so those are those are some of the challenges that we kind of lead into the the social equity talk of the portion of the pocket i don't know if you wanted to add some more to that color to that yeah i mean i think that's something that the the cannabis industry is trying to reckon with with those early legalization states it was like kind of in the back of the mind but it was more important to get the foot in the door to say like okay if we can just get an industry going then we can work out the the pieces later because the more we add especially in states that have single subject rules where you're only allowed a yes or no legalization vote that you can't add in all these social equity aspects and so it's something that's really important on the community level to hopefully set good precedent for when the federal level comes around and that's i think what's really interesting to see right now especially with the lobbying efforts since that's kind of you know how we get things done on the federal level is especially with like labor unions and the corporate sponsors that are coming in with these lobbying efforts as to who are they representing and what are their interests what issues are they pushing um you know it's all we're all facing this similar issue right now that the industry is growing and big money is starting to flow in every single growing industry kind of ends up facing this and so what we're at least on shawn and i side of the industry what we're really focused on is moving and making sure that the advocacy space is a part of this and that's where we can names drop some awesome non-profits that are in the space like normal a national organization to reform marijuana laws mpp uh marijuana policy project ssdp students for sensible drug policy and there's others that are more focused less on lobbying and more on the equity side of things yeah i'll name drop a couple more you know minorities for medical minorities for medical marijuana um another great organization uh my nan yeah one that sal and i work with all the time uh my minority cannabis business association um is really uh really awesome and and and look you know my company you know our our first touch point with um the consumer is it we're a menu right we we're much more than that but that's how most people see us and that's how we touch now for us and one of the things that i enjoy about working for the company um is that it aligns with my own personal values but you know menus aren't interesting if there's one item on it right they're interesting if there are many items on there but people can choose we have a filter that um is this a minority owned business um that that's something that consumers uh cert very much care about you could just filter in and we'll take out the others and and enlist the social equity applicants there are social equity programs in the state or in the area so um it's something that actually drives our business because this space if it only looks homogeneous our our offering is not that interesting and and we we certainly stand to lose less but it's it's also we very strongly feel that if these programs are not robust if they're not uh inclusive they have no chance of passage anyway so might as well work on having as much of a diverse uh workforce and and opportunities that as possible definitely yeah and now that the industry is established there are as shawna mentioned there's still tens of thousands of people being arrested for non-violent drug offenses specifically cannabis but other drugs as well which is kind of where the cannabis industry is headed into these other realms of psychedelics and other exciting things but we'll save that for another conversation but there are some other great non-profits too like the walden project last prisoner uh project and can occlusive which has a subsect of cannabis for black lives matter which is really helpful in basically keeping the industry accountable their focus is to hold down and say oh like look at your board look who your board's made up of yeah sean i know you're going to say you partner with like one of the coolest things they do that which is also like better better not be on this list is that the old uh they have the cannabis accountability project right so when black lives matter black lives matter was really hitting its crescendo obviously it had been around for a number of years so it was really getting its crescendo last year in the wake of george floyd and and so many of the other tragedies that that came over summers you know it was popular to put out a press release you know maybe put a little square on your instagram and says hey we're we're here solidarity right okay they took the names down and said what's your board look like in a year what are your programs looking like are they funded did you give the money you said you were gonna fund where did it go and i i think that's really important um you know trust you're gonna have to get beyond press releases they're all nice and and and that period was important but the actual work the actual moving forward and sticking to doing what you're going to say you're going to do it it's really unique in this in this industry i mean i'm only worked in a couple but i do think that because of its roots because where it comes from and the importance of organizing um they're not going the advocate community is not going down without fight on this stuff and um you know capitalism capitalism and and you know corporations are going to be corporations but um the organizing on this has been extremely impressive uh from a lot of fronts and uh just a shock to all them they're really inspirational on a daily basis yeah coming from the the trenches and door knockings back in the early teens that's definitely it's great to see like how far we've we've come and how the talking points have evolved and and the equity in the space as well i mean that's what's so important too is uh you know sean and i are both leaders at our organization and so what we try to do is make sure that there is room at the table for all aspects whether it's non-profits who are partnering with pro bono work that we're providing um social equity and the way that we give back and you know we're all just at the beginning to see the pathways and it's really not worth closing any doors on any avenues that's what what i do pr and marketing it's all about networking and so we're never going to tell someone no we can't help you we're always going to make an effort to make a single connection because you just never know who that connection is going to lead to maybe it's another three down the line but it's it's important to do your your part and really to make sure that we're providing the space and the equity so a large range of of people are also able to be involved in this space like we're seeing that now with a thought diversity coming in folks coming in from well-established industries in wall street and trying to kind of make things maybe more corporate or change the way that things are or change things to the status quo and so it's important to really approach what we're doing with humility to listen and learn before you speak and to learn about who's actually in the room and bring forward a discussion rather than i'm going to talk at you this is the right way to do things this is the wrong way to do things so with that all in mind you know that's kind of how you become an entrepreneur too in the the cannabis industry yeah see a seamless uh segway that's actually really good yeah um what's kind of what is really cool about the space now is it's cool and frustrating right i will say like if you're looking to make a quick buck um this is not the place for you um but if you are a person who just likes doing a lot of things because one day you may have to review site plans and the next day you have to do an environmental remediation uh study but then the other you might have to do quite a bit of community organizing and basically everyone who runs a cannabis business or gets involved is some form of an organizer it's just like your second job that you have to do even if you're in accounting um you know there's there's so many things that you would you'll be tasked to and it's still outside such a nascent stage that um i i think that was one of the themes of a a lot of the questions that we were pre-getting i was kind of how do you get involved and what can you do well you just have to have a thirst to want to do a lot of things learn a little bit about accounting learn a little bit about the legal process learn a little bit about lobbying learn a little bit about operations learn how to write a press release learn how to run your twitter handle like there's just so much that um folks can do and if you're willing to learn and be patient with it there's the opportunity it's not endless but if this is the kind of place where you want to come in and have a nice cushy corporate job even even for a long-standing company like ours it's over 10 years old if you can believe it um that's not what my day looks like on a general basis there's we're a lot of hats uh even though we're we're what i would say is more late stage uh just you have to wear a lot of different apps and it's so it's fun and exciting but you know those are the challenges i know you found the same story oh yeah definitely i mean our company was founded in 2013-2014 specifically for lobbying and then we started getting into the pr space in 2014 2015. i didn't join until 2017 and i started just doing research for the company also like helping to set up the company itself we didn't have a handbook we didn't have anything we had to like set up employees because everyone was contractors and i didn't have a lot of experience in that and and so now i'm doing marketing i'm i'm leading team members and it's just really you have to be excited and you have to be an entrepreneur um you know i have folks in in the organization where that's one of our screening questions is like tell me about your entrepreneurial past and what you want to keep doing because just because you hire us doesn't or we hire you doesn't mean that there's actually like a horizontal path moving forward you're going to start here and you're just going to climb the corporate ladder that's definitely not how the cannabis industry is and i think it's because it was started by a bunch of mavericks and i think we're going to fight tooth and nail to kind of keep it that way so that only the true enthusiasts and end up staying in the industry and i think that too it's pretty interesting as we see you know a lot of de-stigmatization of folks jumping into the industry as well we have folks coming from wall street coming from you know maybe teachers who are like oh i've actually just wanted to like check out being in the weed industry and what that's like and it's changed a lot so yes you do need to be a jack of all trades um but you can have a specialization as well i think that when the industry started it was saying like okay i just gotta grow weed you know and then i'll be in the industry and now there's so much room for marketing pr professionals for finance folks for lawyers for um you know just like this wide range i mean obviously lobbyists and and so we've got folks kind of like jumping over so i don't know if you've got anything to say on that sean no i mean that's spot-on there's there's there's there's a lot to do i mean um and i i really like the way you framed it like it is it's a place for enthusiasts and it's not sort of just like a job um i i would i would highly stress that and i think for another few years it's can definitely look like quite a lot like that for for the most part of the sector um because it's it's just too it's just too tough of a business i mean absent federal legalization and i'm going from one state to the next there's so many different things that so whatever thing you build has to look different in another state potentially and um so we're constantly just having to stay nimble and not so i really like the way you frame it you'd have to have some enthusiasm to participate in the industry yeah it's definitely interesting seeing like the industry is becoming more established more formalized like now there's written contracts for things whereas before it was just all word of mouth especially you've got a bunch of old heads that have been growing back door like outdoors since the 70s and now they're like all right i'm gonna get legitimate and so you've got this mesh of this old school new school which makes it a really exciting place to be and it's really interesting too to see how like the mainstream is talking about cannabis whether it's pr or marketing um you know sean i'm sure you've got a lot to say on the marketing side with weed maps and and what you've seen and the proper reality and the just like web presence increase and how much you've grown but on the pr side it's really interesting to see the talking points it's changed from marijuana and pot and all these other silly words to recognizing that it's cannabis that's actually the scientific name is cannabis sativa for both cannabis and hemp and so we're starting to legitimize a little bit and and i'm sure now that you've you've heard this when you actually read news articles you'll notice that it's a you know marijuana bus from police versus its cannabis legalization and cannabis businesses and so there's a way now that things are being talked about where it's super different um and it's also really interesting too when we first started doing pr there was you know high times and a couple of other really niche local publications that were covering cannabis and the name of the game was to convince major publications that cannabis is something that readers care about that's going to bring in money you know readership and ad dollars and so we we were perfectly timed with that we had a lot of contacts in the media space and all of a sudden they're like oh we're gonna we got the okay we're gonna start writing a cannabis and so coverage was super easy everyone was really curious and now we're starting to get into this more established market where you have to you know not just go for the cannabis publications and the mainstream publications we have to be super creative about it as well because everybody's opening up shops everywhere and you've got these major players and you know cannabis isn't just this novelty item anymore that it's like oh i'll just write about it because that's fun it's now like legitimate and it's talking about what are these sustainability aspects of cannabis especially green washing is like a huge thing that we need to work on avoiding there's been a lot of pieces earth day is coming up so people are talking about what are the environmental impacts of growing cannabis indoor versus outdoor and how are you you know making sure that sustainability is part of whatever you're doing whether it's working remote so that way you don't you know contribute or you're giving people credits to like ride the subway or to buy a bike so they're able to get to work and so there's all these creative ways that we're really able to like make sure that sustainability is part of the conversation i don't know sean you got anything to say on sustainability uh it's good um yeah i mean this this is we're just now starting to understand um sort of the grow impacts and and all of those those things so i know massachusetts has some of the strictest environmental compliance standards in in the country and i know that they you know it's hard and it's costly um but important ultimately um to to make sure and and face it i mean a lot of the folks from the community cannabis community also do care about protecting the environment so um it's not just the right thing to do it's just a sensible like marketing strategy right because you're a natural core cohort that's going to be drawn even more to your your product if you can build in those efforts um packaging is a major major major problem because of course everyone's worried about the kids getting a hold of of things that they shouldn't be getting a hold of them and um actually kudos from the state of massachusetts they i'm i'm not usually a big uh applauder for free government bureaucracies coming out with creative efforts but they really did a really nice marketing campaign on it um and uh and went after it honestly about you know safe safe storage habits and yes but it's a major problem because that's you know a big increase in plastic waste um by having to in some cases at the outset there's like double bagging and double double value and these things are impossible to open um and and all the kind of waste that goes into it so it is definitely an issue yeah packaging is a serious hot topic issue especially being in a pr company we work with packaging companies a lot and we go through an extra step of vetting when it comes to packaging we're like well so what are you actually doing we're working with one company that collects recycle like ocean like plastic from the ocean and then uses that and to make their packaging and and everybody loves covering that it's super exciting versus other folks they're like oh well you know we're able to like fit our stuff into boxes and square packaging so it's less packaging and so there's this line um when it comes to sustainability when it comes to packaging and thinking of creative solutions as well of like how can you return this back to the dispensary to return it you know to get this kind of closed loop going on so that way they can end up reusing it and one of my favorite face products lush does that where you can just take their packaging back you take it back clean and they reuse it for you and so we have to still work on destigmatizing uh the fact that it's touched cannabis and that it can go back and be reused again so it's really like an interesting uh situation yeah and and and on top of that we haven't even gotten into this but maybe go to questions after this but like what about just the fact that like packaging should look nice right like you have a product you're trying to sell a product and connect with the consumer and connect with people and you know say what you want about the distorted effects of advertising but people don't know that something exists or what they want i mean all of our products are packaged in a way to catch our eye and and tell us something about what's in it and then you have to stick it in this like thing that's double triple steel that's like black and opaque i mean just waste it through those marking dollars out the uh out the door and and the consumer doesn't even know what they're getting or in in some cases you know anything about the thing that they just went in like and and we found a lot of this like the biggest thing is people are intimidated about going into uh shops i think i mean there's there's certainly a set of users it's comfortable and knows that but by and large we've done some polling and testing field testing on this stuff and people are intimidated because they don't they don't have a full knowledge and and how do you gain knowledge how do you ask questions and you read up and you you examine and to put hurdles against that um makes it even more challenging to do what we're all in this do which is to lower the stigma normalize and um you know and at the end of the day um shift through some of our unhealthier habits to uh more balanced and healthier so yeah canada made a really interesting choice when it came to their federal legalization was that you can only have like this tiny like one by one inch square spot for your logo and that's it otherwise no advertising whatsoever and so we're pretty lucky in maths are in the united states as to what we're allowed to to do in each state but it does make such a huge difference if you're going to look at a house brand versus like a multi-state operator that has spent millions of dollars on their branding and packaging it seems more friendly and consumers are more willing to engage with that and talk about it and and learn about it so yeah i mean i think like the last anything you've sean before we kind of like wrap up and go to questions i'm here well hopefully i didn't scare everyone and tell them that this is way too hard uh to get into and stay away i i i i find it helps to be real like it's it's challenging but it's so exciting and and ultimately extremely rewarding when when you actually finally build the thing that you've been working so hard to build yeah definitely i mean i don't think that it's like too intimidating like what's really important in the industry is integrity like if you say you're going to do something the industry is going to hold you accountable to it and if you speak poorly of any others in the industry then you're gonna kind of get yourself locked out really quick we're a super tight-knit community so it can feel a little bit challenging in order to get in but know that like once you're in and you're doing what you need to do the industry has your back and they're going to help you out and keep you in the industry as long as you want to stay there i agree with that wholeheartedly that's great so on on that note i think we'll open up a little bit for questions thank you both so much that was a great overview i know there's so much to cover so we're going to return um us all back together by taking you guys out of the spotlight doing my best to take you out of the spotlight and um those of you who are watching along may want to go back and check your screen and return yourself to gallery view so that you can see everyone who's here and um we should all be coming together and those of you who've got your video off if you're interested in putting your video on and joining us please do and if you um if you have any questions please go ahead and just put them in the chat you don't have to say what they are you can just say i have a question and we'll go around and get to you i'd also like to note that we're really lucky to have with us tonight another another expert that we're aware of we may have more than one expert here but sal pace class of 95 has been active in this industry both on the governmental side as a state representative and um i guess you would call it on the consumer side as a consultant and is now as sean mentioned the chair of the board of the um the marijuana policy project the mpp and so um we're lucky that if we come up with a question that sean or tori can't answer we can throw it to sal and sal i just uh if you've got anything you'd like to add briefly to this conversation we'd welcome your voice in here as well oh i'll i'll be really brief this is uh this conversation covers what i've been doing in my life pretty much non-stop for the last 14 years so uh you know i'm i'm deeply involved in in all of this at various different levels um and sean and i were working on a few projects together in a couple different states and bring together some stakeholders and some projects so i know sean and i i know uh some folks from tory's company as well jason the ceo there it's on the normal board and i've dealt with him a bit but um um you know i just want to you know both first of all both these guys are spot on and all their assessments and and you know what they're saying is is pretty accurate with you know what most people who are pretty knowledgeable in their plug-in know what's going on you know what they'd agree with them um but you know i just want to offer to serve as a resource for folks um you know i uh um you know i you know tori said something about uh connecting people and and relationships and and that's pretty much what i do in my life in my professional career my everything else i do is relationships and i'm always i'm always willing to help out a former or another williston alum so i can be helpful with anybody whether it's advocacy or political or cannabis industry um you know i'm i'm talking to a lot of people and i'm i'm willing to help out and my uh lend my uh assistance to anybody so that's all i wanted to say that's great well thank you for that and while you were talking jen johnson class of 90 raise your hand just to uh shout out that she too is a marketing manager for a cannabis dispensary so we've got more folks from the industry on here so that's great so i'm going to jump into a couple of the questions that were pre-submitted um and leave it up to the two of you to figure out who wants to take first first crack at them um and i don't see i don't see all these people here i'll check first uh pete linkrem are you here pete okay we're gonna ask the question anyway because people are gonna probably watch the recording so uh pete was asking how you think legalization of recreational use will affect the medical cannabis industry which has evolved to already provide extensive guidance and oversight from medical providers about how cannabis can best aid a patient's health and do you think that service will start to disappear as legal recreational use increases i'm happy to take the first step but i i don't i don't think so i i think i don't think it won't disappear and in most states where they've moved forward with adult use um they've done they've put a lot of barriers around the medical program that exists um giving quick access making sure that supply does not run out for that sort of implementing supply limits on the adult use to make sure that massachusetts certainly does that um particularly in the leaner months in the in the winter months where there's a lot supply like they they make sure that there's um um enough for the medical patients and you know tax incentives making sure that it's not taxed and higher potency availability and all that so i think that's that's great there's also another important aspect to adding adult yeast into the mix and i it's unfortunate um but the stigma around that and of getting a medical card particularly for veterans is something that we see a lot veterans are afraid to sign up for medical programs um which has you know in early stages but shown significantly help with ptsd and opiate use disorder and um and assist and move away from some of those other other things but they don't want to sign up for the medical card because the va will will say well you're supposed to cannabis you no longer qualify for va benefits so an illegal adult use pathway allows them to get that recommendation from their doctor and see they'll seek those pathways without putting themselves on that record and putting them on a list they're afraid um and then also gun enthusiasts right people who who you know own firearms um in some cases you're you're not allowed to apply or get a firearm if you are a registered cannabis user um so so there's a big one there and there's just like a run-of-the-mill person who's just like i don't want to be on a doctor's list and all that i just want to you know be canvas for the things that i want want it for and move there so i actually i actually see if done in the right way and we do see this mostly um that the adult use legalization thing is is more about destigmatizing more broadly we'll add to more research um and actually better fill the coffers and enhance medical programs nice i was going to cover all those points so i've got nothing thanks sean that's good because the the questions are coming in fast and furious now you can have the next harder one okay we'll see if this one's any harder um matt wagman had submitted a question ahead of time so matt if you want to unmute and uh join us by video or just by voice you can go ahead and ask your question uh trying to remember my question oh i can help you sure matt wanted to know um is there a possibility that public domestic cannabis companies are given the ability to uplift to a major exchange before federal legalization it's not um do you want me to grab this one i'll i'll start there um one we we are actually in the in the midst of a stacked transaction um which i was under strict items from my legal communications department not to say anything about so that's all i have to say about that thing um but obviously we're not a plant touching uh entity right we don't let's plant very software company that services the industry does compliance software and all those kind of things um i think that one is just like you'd have to think about the purpose of why you would want to do it and just the heart the hard path that you would have i think it probably could be done but it would just be so significantly difficult and and going through um any kind of public offering transaction that's so difficult in itself or i don't know if you just make widgets uh it's hard um why would you add that sort of complexity to your life it just seems it seems possible but very unlikely um so that's what i would say about that thank you yeah matt is that did you that cover your question fully yeah i'll worry anything to add okay i'll add that there's already a lot of companies in the canadian exchange um and uh some in toronto as well and uh a number of those have have american assets so that was that that's definitely important important because yeah and i you know i have no i'm not you know talk to your broker about stock advice i i don't have anything to do with that but you know mixed success um you know and i think i i think so correct me i'm wrong i think the real hope there was like get listed on the canadian exchange and and maybe america would be imminent and it you know it just hasn't proved that way i mean one company famously hired a former speaker of the house thinking it would change everything and it changed very little all right moving on uh niels you're up next with one maybe two maybe three i don't know some questions no no deny i'm grateful for the opportunity to chat with my class of 98 um classmate and also with you tori um so thanks for the opportunity just uh uh one quick legal question um about the you know the uh controlled substances act which you know choppy building off what you were just saying about all of the other issues outside of banking that um you can run into trouble with because marijuana remains you know a listed substance under the controlled substance attack do you see any world where that might change um such that you know gun use uh access to medical benefits you know for veterans other things outside of what's covered in sort of safe banking might become more accessible for companies that actually touch plants in the future what do you think all right i feel like i've been hogging the mic but i have a quick strong feeling about it go ahead well i i just think there's no world in which the that like significant federal marijuana reform um goes forward that does not address it and uh significantly de-list and the schedule are just completely the uh the schedule um so yeah i um so i know mvp has a significant chance on that on that position and and what would move forward but i i can't imagine that should be more act would move forward and not address that issue interesting kind of my sort of 1b question is you know there's so much both in my my current gig working at a crypto company and in my prior gig working at a fintech there's so much interest in you know working in the crypto space particularly for like funds flows and payment processing but because of the overlay of the control substances act you know like even in spite of the obama doj era guidance that kind of loosened up vincent enforcement and doj enforcement around um you know legal state marijuana businesses lots of banks financial institutions credit card networks like don't really want to touch the space so this is kind of more of an industry question you know given i think the very positive testimony from merrick garland uh during his ag um you know discussions with the senate do you see any kind of more traditional banks financial institutions in the context of going public or an ipo like underwriters getting more comfortable uh touching um the cannabis business because it's from what i've seen and i have a limited view on this from my experience but books seem very hands-off um do you see kind of more traditional players getting more involved in the industry moving forward through the current sort of ease of enforcement that both merrick garland and some of his predecessors have articulated as being sort of the the role of federal enforcement in the space yeah um well one is like kind of like the reinstatement of the coal memorandum right and whether that would would happen um yeah i mean i think there's a couple parts to your question the first i would i don't think it's so for instance no like state legalization would have any political pathway forward without uh addressing the expungement issue right the the prior arrests and firearms i'm getting getting rid of that well it actually turns out that like doing that is kind of actually legally difficult um and in some states but it's just and and people who are like i don't want to like throw that up as an excuse not to and that's totally fair but it is actually a little bit difficult because think about this is there's there's usually a weapons charge um quite often not usually but quite often and there's a weapon charge because it's a legal thing and you know it's like you have to protect yourself and protect your business so what do you do about the weapons charge that gets thrown in and that gets a little bit company i know that michael thompson this kind of hung up his case was a famous case taken up by the last prisoner project in in michigan and you know there was old weapon shots well you know uh if you're moving that kind of product in an unregulated um illicit space you probably have a weapon um and that's just the fact of the matter so so those things get a little bit more complicated that doesn't quite get to your thing but it does start to get it like these things have like so many layers so like start moving them through and and enforcement so the final thing i would i would say is last year when there did seem to be a little bit of movement on safe you know i just kind of did a little like look poke around it's like who's lobbying on this issue and it turned out that like wells fargo was lobbying on this issue a little bit and um bank of america was flying on us a little bit and um i don't know i i did a little bit more pokemon i don't know if they were yes or no right then that didn't come out right i don't know if it's like yes or no i don't know you have a was it were they yeah the america american bankers they're yes they're they're really they're really pretty vulnerable you know i can i can jump in here my last call right before this was with uh senator ron wyden of uh of oregon and and it was just like two hours after he released a video with him and booker and schumer on on schumer's balcony talking about how they're going to work on on cannabis reform um you know they're very they think they can get some stuff with rec some stuff done with reconciliation and those of you guys who are like politics nerds um you know it's a process of getting uh some things through the senate with 51 with 51 votes instead of with 60 votes in a getting over the um the filibuster um but you know niels as as far as the question about controlled substances act i think anything that deschedules marijuana you know because right now everyone marijuana is a schedule one it's the same as like um i don't know crack cocaine on the controlled substances act and so it's the controlled substances act that makes marijuana illegal at federal level so anything that deschedules it and it's not going to be the more act more act i don't think is is you know has a chance of getting through the senate um would by definition take it off the controlled substances act um i do think you know safe banking safe banking is the ed promoter um is the ed promoter bill that would uh make it legal to bank in the banking in the cannabis industry and i think most people feel really good about the chance of safe banking and and even getting it done before the august recess is what schumer's saying right now now it's i guess it i guess it just got introduced today in the house and um in the uh in the senate the the thing that'll change it now is with sherrod brown as the uh as the banking chair in the senate you know he's talking about uh issues of equity he's talking about labor issues and whether or not he might be trying to amend the bill to ensure labor prohibitions and equity provisions and then what that can do for as a negotiating point from the cannabis industry on on taxation 280e is an issue it's a tax code that says if you're [Music] trafficking a schedule one narcotic or schedule two narcotics of doing business so employee costs are actually taxed as as profit in the marijuana industry and so there might be an opportunity if brown is trying to insert in some labor provision to negotiate a a tax fix you know it's really inside baseball but it means a lot more money for the industry and a lot more opportunity for paying employees better wages and and benefits and whatnot so there's a there's a lot of moving parts and people are more optimistic i think than ever um on federal reform the last thing i'll mention we just had our first board meeting today the new brand new u.s cannabis council which is a combination of mvp uh cannabis trade federation of glac global alliance of cannabis and hemp of attach and some of the biggest multi-state operators like canopy and acreage um columbia care chronos a number of other folks hawthorne they're um miracle grow and and now we all have under one umbrella ninety percent of all the federal lobbyists in dc we're lobbying pro legalization uh all under one umbrella and it's an exciting development and an opportunity to to really push the ball forward we're hoping and because the industry level has been very fragmented and there's been a lot of folks pushing different directions and and i think it's a perfect timing aligned with uh with uh you know the you know the new senate majority leader who for the first time ever had there's a senate majority leader talking about legalizing marijuana all right thank you so we're gonna uh henry mitchell has been sitting up there very patiently with his hand raised in the corner of the screen henry we're gonna go to you next yeah thank you can you hear me all right you're good sure ken hey henry yeah um thanks a lot chappie and tori wonderful dialogue i would like to know what your opinions are in terms of what the relationship to the illegal growers i would assume that there still is a fairly large illegal growth of cannabis that goes into circulation do you have any idea how big that is so how big the illegal grower industry is yes uh i mean there's there's like a there's a million estimations or they range from but it's it's certainly significant i think california probably has the largest um proportion of that um i can go off on a whole tangent about how my intersection of the modern solar industry and the modern cannabis industry kind of came together and like why those two things like uh are the best of friends because they had a massive significant load they were trying to uh trying to hide from utilities and so they all started installing solar and so like the way you made money as a solar installer was like going to mendo and selling i don't know i don't have any good estimate but canada for instance um estimates that they're only capturing of all the cannabis transactions now and it's federally legal in the entire country they're only capturing something like 30 of all of the cannabis industry um through the regulated market so it's it's still significant even in canada um it's plus plus 70 um of the market potentially um that that may be a little high but it's definitely at least 50 um percent in canada um and i would i would suspect in in california it's it's certainly it's certainly 70 still um there's just a lot i mean there's a huge long history um i'm gonna i'll spin a little yarn here for a second but there's a long history there and you know the idea of taxing this product and plant um is really anesthetic to a lot of people there and it's just i think we're going to have to go just be patient and take the time to to capture that and not not freak out because we're missing that 70 but be proud that we were able to capture that 30 and build on that from there the other question that that i had was in the states where they have legalized it is it legal for people to grow their own or have that they because they've made it legal to buy it they foreclosed opportunities for people to grow their own product not for sale but for their own use it really depends on the the state each framework is different so washington and colorado passed at the same time colorado has homegirl washington does not they're working on implementing it now almost a decade later so it really depends and and to speak quickly on the illicit market there's still moonshiners out there producing alcohol even though it's totally legal so there's still going to be an illicit market but the the point is just to get the the taxes and the incentive low enough so that it's easy enough for folks to join the legal market and to hopefully get rid of all these illicit states that are funding that right now like colorado's is huge it's just getting shipped to every single state that we touch because they're all illegal still okay well thank you very much uh it's been very enjoyable okay so we have time for a couple more questions if you want to put them into the chat and i still have a couple more questions here that were pre-submitted so i'm gonna go to the next one um which goes to a little bit about what you were talking about about relationships and i don't know if jp is on the call jp are you that phone maybe if you are you can unmute and ask your question and if you're not i'm going to ask it um so we've got a question from uh jp uh jpreview who's 93 and he asks uh as an electrical contractor how does he build relationships with company owners that are developing both growth facilities and retail storefronts so if you're if you're in the you know in a supporting business how do you make those connections research uh is definitely the best way to go every state you have to if you're a legal grow or dispensary you have to register yourself and so it's going on like in massachusetts the cannabis control commission's website and literally just mining for information hitting them up on linkedin showing up at their stores because they're never going to return your emails or answer your calls and so it's just all about networking research on that one totally totally agree and and as both dorian and were saying like you come into this business you're you're doing everything but i think one of the best ways to do that research uh have a great proposal and take one thing off their plate you know like and a complicated thing at that right so um just know that they're probably overstretched so the second email is probably the one that they'll answer not you know not the first and in fact maybe not even the second probably the 15th um but it's just it's just a matter of staying with it having a working with within the bounds of what they need i totally agree though great i i'll have to list on these things so they're usually publicly available especially in massachusetts definitely yeah and just doing a good job too and building that relationship because we're going to refer in the cannabis industry we're pretty lazy folks sometimes and to make our jobs easier if we have one good person we're going to shoot them out to everyone we know that's good to know um especially with the williston connection here you may hear from you may hear from people um jen you've got a question if you'd like to unmute and ask um yeah hi how's it going i use weed maps we just signed up for mass for all your pilot stuff um yes don't don't even don't be shy for even a second if they're giving any trouble sending me i'll crack some skulls everyone's been super great really knowledgeable the person on my account has been pretty amazing so good job um i do have a question so i'm having a hard time finding for people who ask me and for me as a marketer a lot of uh so we're in multiple states so um some so connecticut medical only how do we find the doctors that are uh registered to do medical there's nowhere to find it can't figure out from the board of physician you know board of physicians um and for in thinking of this and trying as a marketer to find the names of the doctors how do patients find the physician who will be able to um give those medical cards yeah um that's a you know what i i don't have a great answer i'm going to think about that and like just ask the little round internally if i can get back to better answer we we did have once a time a filter of how to find a doctor to get a wreck um on the platform i don't know we still have that though frankly i don't use that much in new york because there's not much for me isn't here um but when i'm in california use it all the time um but i haven't been to california in over a year um but i that is an excellent i think it's an excellent resource one that i don't have a great answer to right now to point you towards but um i can i'll i'll just poke around a little bit on the old swac channel and get back to you yeah hey jen sorry shoot me an email and i'll connect you with somebody awesome thank you certain interim yeah i was gonna say probably like google at this point is is your best friend at least if you're in a already legal state they're not shy about getting out there otherwise you know i think that it's just going to be this word of mouth is probably the best way to do it i just encourage everybody to take a minute and scroll through the chat people have been putting in their contact information so that uh i know sal i saw sal put his in um tori sean if you want to drop yours in there people can just quickly scroll through although they can find you through all kinds of williston platforms as well um all right well that is i do not have any more pre-submitted questions although this is the part of the evening where i always you know i ask the question that i have a burning desire to know about oh no there's actually now i don't know did you guys putting in contact information excellent so revealing how completely shallow i am um i'd be curious to hear what your take is on all of the celebrity products celebrity cannabis products that are being introduced you talk a little bit about the brand names and the big story yeah i mean you might have noticed a bunch of celebrities enter in the space and you hear a big buzz and then they just disappear um there's been a lot of research done and you know they don't necessarily have that brand longevity right now that other other brands do so that's kind of what we're we're seeing is especially like martha stewart and her cbd it was absolutely everywhere but uh now that it's launched i haven't heard of it actually yeah i mean i think there's two two things like there's people who are like clear they're they're they're there and i mean snoop seems to want to put his name on everything um around it is on on everything but there's you know there are people for whom this isn't this is just kind of like a fly-by-night um i know that uh man uh the the belushi that's still with us um he he's got a a brand in out of chicago that i think is he stick with it it's more than him just being like a celebrity like i think that's actually his business that's that is what he is doing um one of the other things that you know because the industry is so newish in its current form obviously it's extremely old um cannabis sativa has been found in viking tunes so like i mean it's it's been around but in its current form it's new-ish you just have this i feel like every week i have a new thing that is like i have to worry about this most recent week was delta 8 and learning everything about delta 8 and what delta 8 is even apparently can be reduced out of cbd form and hemp hemp as well and has gotten around some of the federal restrictions on that that you all don't need to know what delta 8 is because it will not be around to worry about in two weeks right like it and that's kind of the thing it's like these cbd things were just popping up everywhere and now it's kind of calmed down and that's just sort of where we're in and the celebrity thing is no different um everyone seems to want to pop off a brand and get ready we're we're about to hit the holy month so that's going to be a great month for everyone to throw off their cannabis brand stuff uh here and uh as we approach uh april the 20th so um you know it it kind of comes with the territory and you start to you start to learn to shrug it off like the all the puns that are in the industry too but you and you move on to the next thing yeah if anyone's thinking about doing a cannabis launch in april or 420 don't we tell all of our clients that is the worst time because it's nobody's going to listen to you because everybody's talking just then i guess i was thinking of uh you know the preview of seth rogen's um beautifully uh created um uh pottery items for you know enhancing your cannabis experience in your home which was in the style section of the times so like that would be that would be like almost an exception like it's very clear that all that's very genuine right he is he is not a fly-by-nighter he is not it's not like he's admitted he's not he's not martha stewart right and as much love and affection i have from martha's spirit um you know it's seth rogen has been talking about from the second he hit hollywood um done movies about it like that is part of who seth rogen is and i think like tori has said like a thousand times already on this fall and and i really drive i love the point it's like the genuineness that gets to stick around people sniff that out pretty quickly and um if you're authentic and genuine you've got a brand you've got something you can do with it but if you're just popping in to sell it at walgreens people would be like yeah screw you later all right well uh any other questions from anyone else left paul for your for your burning questions all right so i think that um we're going to thank sean and tori for their time and their expertise tonight thanks to sal for timing in", "0WzwQkeY-nE": "hello and welcome to the Migro Youtube\nchannel my name is Shane and I'm the founder of Migro in this video we're\ngoing to look at what are the optimum conditions for your grow room to get the\nbest growth and maximum yield so plants of course need adequate water and\nnutrients to grow healthily but photosynthesis which is the driver of\nthe plant growth it would be largely determined by the amount of light the\nplant receives the amount of co2 the plant receives and also the temperature\nof the environment which will determine the rate that the photosynthesis occurs\nthe data and the references that we're using in this guide are taken from a\nUniversity study published in 2008 by scientist Suman Chandra which are\nlaboratory studies carried out on a high potency strain of cannabis sativa where\nthey looked at the influence of different temperatures light intensity\nlevels in par and co2 levels and the effect on plant growth so let's look at\neach of these in turn so first we look at the level of light intensity that the\nplant is receiving and we're talking about photosynthesis of course we're\ngoing to be talking about light in terms of the horticultural reference which is\npar photosynthetically active radiation and at par levels up to 1500 micro moles\nper meter square per second you can increase growth rates however it's also\nshown that once you get past around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second the rate of growth that you get is not really worth\nthe amount of extra light energy that you're having to input into the plant so\nit's generally accepted that around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second is the best trade-off between getting maximum growth\nand not having to use too much energy to get that growth and all the heat and\neverything else that comes with it of course in this is for the flowering\nstage in the vegging stage you would aim to get about 50\nto those levels so somewhere in the region of about 300 350 micromoles per\nmeter square per second you can achieve this by getting your light fixture\nreducing the output from your light fixture using a dimmer if you're using a\nnumber of fixtures by having the number of fixtures you are using or by just\nraising it about one and a half to two times higher than its optimal hanging\nheight and this will reduce the intensity directly underneath the light\nand reduce the light intensity for the vegging stage the optimum temperature\nfor plant growth was tested at two different light levels and sort of a\nmedium of medium and power intensity level of 500 micro moles per second and\nthen a very high level of attires and micro moles per second in both instances\nthe maximum plant growth rate occurred at 30 degrees Celsius and fall off\nfalls off quite significantly where five degrees above or below this temperature\nof course all different strains are going to have have different\nrequirements and needs in terms of temperature our suggestion would be that\na safe band of temperature to operate in would be between 25 and 30 degrees\nCelsius and you should get optimum growth and minimize the risk of\nstressing your plants through to higher temperature finally we look at the\nimpact of different levels of co2 on Plank Road you can see the normal\natmospheric level of co2 is about 370 parts for a million this would be air\nthat you'd be taking into your grow room from the external environment ie fresh\nair if you are replacing that fresh air regularly the general guidance for\ncirculating air range of grow room would be about 60 changes per error and if\nyou're achieving this it's highly likely that you're maintaining that atmospheric\nlevel of co2 in your grow room difficulty with using this system so\ndrawing fresh air in and expelling it out into\nthe atmosphere is it's very hard to increase the co2 level because if you if\nyou input more co2 into the grow area it's only gonna get drawn out just as\nquickly and so it's almost impossible to artificially raise co2 levels there are\na couple of ways of doing it you can enclose the environment so that the air\nrecirculates back into the grow room or is recirculated around the grow room and\nyou use a co2 sensor and some form of adding co2 some technologies such as co2\nbags or burners or co2 tanks and you can use this to artificially elevate the co2\nlevel in your grow room another method you could use is to use effectively\nnatural and free sources so we all expel out co2 when we're breathing and\ntherefore in occupied buildings the co2 level is often raised as much as twice\nthe level of from the external atmosphere that this would be normal and\nso if you can take air into your grow room from an occupied building so a\nhouse or workplace you will most likely be bringing in elevated levels of co2\ninto your grow room which will increase the growth rate so I hope you have got\nsome useful information out of this guide if you have any questions or\nqueries

manufacturer of cannabis oil and concentrates in Oregon we've been in business since April 2016 and we have just recently begun selling in Nevada we have a full manufacturing facility and we this month we will be selling in California again where we have a complete manufacturing facility and I'll explain what manufacturing or production of cannabis oil and concentrates are a little later we're proven and skilled operators with innovative products I'm not up here saying that I worked at at an investment bank and I did this and I did that I've done all of that but that was when I had hair now I'm since 2013 I've been in the cannabis space and the focus of my operated and operating experience in the cannabis space is in the production of oil and concentrates we started this company actually in a chicken coop in April of 2000 actually in late 2015 put some actually in the old days what we did is we had a little post in front of a in front of my partner's house Andreas and we nailed by 20 medical cards to the post we kicked the chickens out of the chicken coop Andreas was blasting as we call it is is that is the slang term for making oils and concentrates I was getting the material from the local farms and we put it in Grady's hatchback Celica and sold them in Oregon and then lo and behold by a year later we were the second largest player in Oregon and you know effectively dominating the concentrate market we do have even though we do spend a little time in chicken coops we also do have blue chip pedigrees I myself went to brown then went to Wharton was a banker for while my father invented the floppy disk drive so I always had entrepreneurship in my blood and I was living abroad when the whole marijuana thing hit in 2012 and I came back to be involved in the business Chris who's speaking after me I was a seed investor in his company emerald I had a peripherals company that I've ended into a very small company called namaste technologies at ten cents a share so I know how to create shareholder value and so does our team in a must date today I think I think it closed at 280 it's as high as it went as high as five and three 365 middle of last week and I think it's the fourth most active cannabis stock in the world yeah and as the symbol namaste technologies okay yes okay so so the one thing we're doing here is that we are planning to open the stock at a significant discount to both our US peers and Canadian peers one of our philosophies is to at the end of the day it's not how it's not you know as an owner and I've my family's invested eight million in this company it's not how much you own but it's a question of how much share Val shareholder value have you created and so our whole goal here is to create shareholder value for ourselves and for our investors so as I said we've been operating in Oregon since 2016 we have a 20% wholesale wholesale market share and I want to give you a perspective about Oregon I say if you can make it in Oregon you can make it anywhere it is the absolute worst cannabis market in the world I have over a hundred and twenty competitors and yet I still have 20% share we've sold over 2.5 million grams that is users who have bought our products in the state of Oregon our 2.5 million grams I don't know many other cannabis companies if any that can say that they have legally sold that many oils that much oil or concentrates we're currently shipping in Oregon a hundred thousand grams monthly in Nevada we have a manufacturing license and the economics and Nevada couldn't be couldn't be any better relative to Oregon where they're probably where I probably only have about 40 competitors and we have a binding LOI in place to acquire the production license we operate under and cultivation licenses one thing we like to do in markets where we need to do it is cultivate our own product that's what the LPS who you're seeing do and we cultivate a lot but we don't cultivate in such a way to make the best flower in the world we cultivate to have the highest amount of THC CBD in order to extract so we can cultivate as low as 20 cents a gram and as high as 40 cents a gram in Southern California we're will be operational this month and we have 90 400 square feet of licensed facilities and we have a contract in hand that if we can execute will provide us 2 million a month of revenue at a 40% profit margin that's 2 million US Canada we have a binding LOI in place with a large Canadian LP but the business we do today in the u.s. is not legal in Canada the expectation when you speak to people but no one really knows is that oils and concentrates will be fully legalized by the end of next year also internationally because we have a reputation for being leaders in extraction we've been exploring multiple opportunities abroad be a Germany be it from Africa to Colombia to Cambodia however right now our heads are down our revenue and Oregon's a million a month if this is us if we can keep going on the path we're at by the end of the year we hope to be between 4 to 5 million a month that's between let's say 45 to 60 million in revenue just in Oregon Nevada and California in Oregon I emphasized we have a you know we have a leading market share we've shipped 2.5 million grams 20 million in revenue 20 percent market share we have a 12,000 square foot facility know in the US we don't have baseball fields like they have up here and you can't see our facilities and satellites but we put up some serious numbers we have seven acres of outdoor canopy in Jackson County that is cultivation again captive to our factory but to give you a perspective seven acres of grow is two months of our capacity and we have 28 months of history we've grown in a hundred and seventy percent in Oregon and we continue to grow despite Oregon's deflation what I used to sell for fifteen dollars a gram today I sell for six dollars in Oregon and the reason we had negative EBIT Don 2017 is because we had people in place in California in Nevada putting those licenses up while we had no revenue so we see an inflection point to turn into positive EBIT da by q1 of 2019 in Nevada we have an eight thousand square foot facility that's capable of doing 15 thousand grams per day with an annual capacity of 45 million Nevada right now is constrained by raw material you cannot take raw material from one state across state lines to the other and if all of you know Nevada it's desert so growing there is a little bit more challenging and so we feel that cultivation will catch up by q2 of next year and we'll be able to clip at a much higher rate but right now the Nevada market is supply constrained so our revenue forecast is at a million a month on a go-forward basis California is an interesting market California is 30 percent larger than all of Canada it's an extremely fragmented market it is just gone legal this year we have a 90 we have ninety four hundred square feet of space these are older numbers we have about thirty thousand grams of capacity there and we could probably do about a hundred million the issue with California right now is that there's an abundance of material but having a supply chain that's consistent where we can get clean material and get clean material on the shelves is the key we have a contract in hand with a very large brand the largest in Southern California to supply them as much oil as we can produce in our first phase that would be about 70,000 grams per week which is about $500,000 per week we expect to be fully operational on phase one in October if not earlier we have a strategic relationship with a Canadian LP I don't want to emphasize this now because what we do currently is not legal in Canada so as this becomes more and more clear to us than Canada will become more and more relevant a lot of people will talk to you about extraction and say look we have the best technology our technology is better than anyone elses having been in this business for five years now which is an eternity in the marijuana business I can tell you that you need to be an expert in almost every type of extraction because you have different type of end products that suit different types of consumers based on your extraction technologies we have volatile extraction technologies which make concentrates and then we have chemical and co2 technologies that make vape cartridges and so these two are principally the forms of oils and concentrates that are sold in the United States let me emphasize that also oils are what goes into edibles and currently in Canada you sell tinctures at a very low potency under 20% which are effectively Angelle caps which are effectively diluted oils made through ethanol extraction with MCT coconut oil olive oil what have you in in the states we don't have we do have edibles restrictions but they're not as strict so the potencies we offer there are substantially higher than what you're allowed in in Canada to date a lot of people will come to you and they'll say to you you know we're developing a brand we're gonna develop brands and our brands are gonna be the best I'm gonna give you a contrary in view my my two partners who started the business with me Philip who was the first CFO at golden leaf took the first US company public on the Canadian stock exchange and andreas who was the senior vice president of sales at golden leaf and also was a senior executive at Walmart our view is in a market where for every hundred adults in even the state of California maybe 15 used the product its nascent its early stage so the brands that are around today will not be the brands in the end I believe that will win the day how many of you guys ever heard of Alta Vista that was the number one search engine before Google have you ever heard of Betamax tape that was the number one standard before the VHS came so in our view what we want to do is we want to generate revenue and we want to generate profitability and our number one strategy is white label because at the end of the day we don't know if it's the dispensary the distributor or the farm that will have the best brand so we back dispensaries we back farms and we do white label and we do build plant brands when people ask for it and it's a necessity now I'm not I'm not one to toot our horn but you know our brand hush is the number two brand in the state of Oregon so just by default we have 50,000 people a day a month who use our products and we do have a brand but brand isn't the big strategy the big strategy with us is really white labeling using our expertise in oils and concentrates to create barriers to entry and to keep our heads down and focused on that we also have technology one of the founders is a top scientist from the University of Southern California he actually invented the drug taxall which is the lead in chemotherapy cancer drug he has a hundred FDA patents so we've come up with a dab tab which is a doable way to take concentrates right now concentrates have a stigma you have to get a torch you have this thing called a rig it's very messy but strong users and medical users love concentrates because it's bought broad spectrum and so we've developed a product you don't need to have a special capsule like cure egg or a special device it works with all devices where you can preload a certain amount of concentrate into a wafer you put that wafer on whatever device you want and it gives you a precise concentrate dose this is something we plan to launch in the late in late q4 we already we also have a lot of other sort of delivery device technologies up our sleeves however this is the one we're focused on now and our D is a big part of what we do science is a real big part and then the goal really is right now with oils and concentrates to extract THC to extract CBDs and provide formulations that the markets like I myself I give you a little bit about my background before I did this I had a bank in Europe I'm the Audit Committee Chair of namast\u00e9 and I've taken a couple of companies public but I'm really deep and I've been really deep into marijuana literally packing columns and trimming plants and I can tell you a lot about it um Andreas was a senior merchant at Walmart he developed our initial marketing strategy which was opening price point which means that at any segment of the market we're at the opening price point the reason we're at the opening price point is because most people coming into a dispensary are coming in for their first or second time they're gonna want to try a product they're gonna go for the type of product they want at the lowest price point if they like it they're gonna stick to it and that creates consumer stickiness at this point Phillip is our CFO he spent a considerable amount of time at Goldman Sachs Philip had sort of a midlife crisis I would say 60 and he said he was managing a lot of money in Europe and in 2012 we were seeing the whole marijuana thing come to fruition so he came to the states and said we'd get involved Philip took you know took golden leaf public it was the first of its kind people didn't know what the CSE was at the time and then he went over to namaste when we sold a company into it and he managed them through their growth daniel was with rock shield rock shield was the sponsor of the green rock tour the green organic Dutchman Organa Graham what have you and he's handling our he's effectively managing our stock Chris recently we brought on from the beverage industry to manage sales in California Nevada and Oregon our Chairman is Scott Patterson who is a Canadian he was the former chairman of the Canadian Venture Exchange which was the precursor to the CSE Fred Leigh is an external director so is Peter McRae I emphasized our science that's dr. Prakash Gill who actually has been sat on FDA advisory committees and as an endowed chair professor and Valeria's our day to day scientist so when I talked about valuation you know here's what I'm this is what I'm saying so we have about a hundred and fifty seven million shares outstanding of which day one about 70 million will be trading we have warrants and options that are out of the money the last round we did was at 40 cents it gives us a 63 million dollar valuation we deduct the cash we have on our books that gives us an enterprise value based on our last round of fifty million Canadian with historical trailing sales of fifteen million Canadian and expected sales this year of approximately thirty million Canadian and a run rate going forward of sixty million Canadian so quite frankly I don't know of any stock trading on the on the canadian exchanges in the marijuana space that has that sort of value potential for investors it'll be halo h al oh no it's going us companies can't list on the venture we're actually doing what we did at golden where we went on the CSC first we're going on an exchange sponsored by the Royal Bank of Canada called the Neo Ennio but if you type halo into your into your machine you'll get it or into your computer so it it's just kind of silly when you look at this so compared to compared to Canadian companies based on our last belt round we're trading at about two times our revenue this year and point six times so you can see that we're almost trading at a ninety percent discount to our Canadian peers granted they're much bigger companies and granted they're operating in a federally legal space but a ninety percent discount is is pretty compelling then you look at our US peers excuse me this is our us peer sorry so in compared to our US peers we're trading at a ninety per our last round was done at a ninety percent discount compared to our Canadian peers it becomes preposterous but granted as I said they're operating in a federally legal environment they're they're much better capitalized but yet if you look at this discrepancy you know something has to give at some point and then just we emphasize we're a leading manufacturer of cannabis oil and concentrates in Oregon we are manufacturing and selling in Nevada since August 2018 where this month opening up in California with an official launch in October were proven and skilled operators we're an experienced team and we have an attractive valuation population I mean a proposition thank you very much I'll take questions now sure we're listing at the end of this month the expected date of listing is the 27th it may move by two or three days two or three days either side the ticker will be halo I don't know what price the market will open at but the last round we did it was at 40 cents in that 50 million enterprise value it'll be on the Neo but just type halo in on average it depends on market to market but I would say probably about 12 to 15 dollars per gram on product but remember it's a concentrate so it's it's 1/10 it takes 10 grams of flour to make one gram of concentrator oil okay thank you thanks [Applause]", "sBWfFm5ebpE": "right to talk to you today about the clinical application of cannabinoids and terpenoids for chronic illnesses because I think what people really want to know is how to actually dose you know give this cannabis plants would you actually do with them and what do you use them for which diseases so I'll very very very quickly go through the basics if by Sunday afternoon at a cannabis conference you don't know what the endocannabinoid system is then really there's probably not much point in explaining it at this point but anyway within our bodies we have this a doggedness system that is the goal the endocannabinoid system is homeostasis it's to create a sort of balance or equilibrium within the body and so the theories are of course that when you have imbalance or a lack of homeostasis in the body that is when disease can occur so the same way that you have all these other systems in your body unfortunately medical schools do not teach about the endocannabinoid system for the most part at this point which is well part of the big challenge that we have with the medical community is they just don't understand it they can tell you about the circulatory system they can tell you about the nervous system they can tell you about the gastrointestinal system but they can't tell you about the endocannabinoids system because nobody bothered to tell them anyway the same way that if you were a not getting enough sunlight for example your doctor might prescribe for you to take vitamin d3 as a supplement your vitamin C levels are low you might take vitamin C you might eat oranges you might take it as a supplement it's the same thing with cannabis based medicine it is simply a phyto or a plant-based version of what your body produces on its own if you don't have enough you take it from an outside source just like you would vitamin C or d3 it's really nothing much more sophisticated than that there's been a whole lot of drama created around it and a lot of sexiness and a lot of other things but it's really just giving you your body and a correct dose of cannabis you don't really have to feel all that particularly altered if you have the correct amount because if you keep in mind that homeostasis is the goal of cannabinoid therapy then you only need to take it to the point where you have that now we're not talking about serious things like cancer treatments and things but for the general for most illnesses you do not have to be greatly altered by it in order to have it successfully treat your diseases okay so the next thing is we may have heard a lot about terpenes or terpenoids terpenoids are simply terpenes in combination with other terpenes and other cannabinoids they become these other forms that are just interpreted as an oversimplification but it's really enough to know so no one's really talking about anything different when they're talking about terpenoids they're just sounding more more technical anyway a couple examples you have of terpenes are alpha-pinene and limonene now alpha-pinene is found in pine trees also and it's also in many cannabis strains especially in cannabis in the more sativa type cannabis trains and then limonene it's found in lemon rinds and in some strains of cannabis as well also also frequently shown in sativa I'll tell you an interesting personal experience I got on an airplane on an international flight recently and I was exhausted and irritable and had been a bad travel day and the first thing that did it the flight attendant did was bring me a wet towel that was scented with lemon and I put it up to my face and I had this overwhelming calm and sense of well-being that came over me and that's very much the same lemon that's in cannabis so lemon is a lemon is the lemon where ever do you find the benefits of it anyway so here down here are some of the more common ones we have is the alpha pining like I mentioned at little which also is from the pine trees you have lintel which is very effective as an analgesic anti-anxiety and it's found in lavender you know we go get a massage they have the room it's all scented with lavender we have these same components right in our cannabis plants beta carefully no beta-carotene is the most abundant and something called Ashanti pepper it's whitish ah it's black ishani pepper white cannabis and then black pepper and white pepper so whenever they the man at the restaurant comes around with the grinder asking if you want some pepper on your food you say yes please because you will be in fact activating your cb2 receptor sites when you eat black pepper beta carotene is one of the is one of the only known substances outside of cannabis specifically that acts directly on the cb2 receptor sites without interfering with the uptake of the THC so it's very very helpful for that so we look for we look for strains that are very high in beta-carotene especially if we're dealing with diseases where there's a lot of cb2 receptor sites now mersin mersin is found very often in it what's found in hops but it's also found in mangoes there's an old hippie trick of eating a mango before you get high to increase it well what's really happening is the mersin cuts through the the blood-brain barrier and makes you have a higher uptake of the cannabinoids which is why it makes you higher and so you don't only have to use these but it also has a very much of a sedative effect as well you find it more in your indica type strains and I'll go into a little more about what those those terms even mean in a minute but mersin is very very helpful especially when you're dealing with very very serious chronic diseases then lemon een as I said it's great for acid reflux it's good for is an anti-anxiety and antidepressant and it's found in lemons now the let's talk about the importance of the entourage effect this is a this is a important comment that at the beginning Stuart Smith who is my partner in this he says all the time you just don't have any marinol addicts and the reason it is is THC on its own feels pretty crappy it is not a fun medicine so it's not the THC that everybody wants it's the THC in conjunction with the other cannabinoids and the other terpenes that have this entourage effect that we talk about that actually creates the various sensations because THC on its own is not where it's not very not very welcome yes and some people have some limited results with nausea and maybe going through chemotherapy things like that but for the most part it is not a very pleasant substance on its own it's far more effective when it's mixed with the other things now right now we know we have about a hundred approximately a hundred I read something different all the time but a hundred different cannabinoids and about 500 different terpenes I have not run the math but if you take how many possible can combinations there are of those that can be implants it's an it's an almost it's close to infinite it's a huge huge number of different combinations we could have of cannabinoids and terpenoids for different things so whoops okay sorry so we already talked about mercy and Lebanon here then it's other also important to talk about some of the other major cannabinoids there the more considered more of the minor only from the standpoint that tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD get all of the press and all the people pay attention to but more and more people are starting to understand the importance of some of the other major cannabinoids like CBG now I also think part of this is market is market driven you know there's a patent or somebody has you know kind of cornered the market on CBD like sativex has been working on so let's have somebody else that want to do it with CBG well CBG is the mother compound all all cannabinoids come from CBG a in a plant and then into CBG is it is it d carboxylates and then from there CBG will become then THC a CBD a etc through all the other cannabinoids but it's also very very good for pain relief and it works when you when you take hc' in combination with CVG you have a better analgesic effect than you do when it's on its own CB n which is what THC degrades to for anybody who's had any cannabis laying around they left it out sitting in the sunlight for an extended period of time you'll see the next time you go to smoke it it makes you a little bit sleepy er and that's because of the degradation of the THC into cbn sometimes we push cbn or we want to have cbn so that we can make medicines that are be used more for sleep or more for nighttime much more zombie land effect on them it also it's great for pain relief and then of course CBD is a cb1 and cb2 antagonist but when combined with THC it's it's far makes it far more effective see here what I'm saying right now we also have like 5700 of course that was last week it's probably 7,000 this week and every time I go to seed finder EU I'm just shocked at how many more strains there are just have to look out here at all the geneticists and all the seed breeders out there you know we started out with a hundred strains and now there's almost there's 6000 strains so what is the strain you start out like I said with the landrace strains and these were the original ones that grew out in the wild you had alcopop go gold you had Panama red you had Afghani you have all of these strains that were actually the ones that grew their god-given however whatever you believe that plants were just there in nature one of the things that we've been collecting on in our research is we ask people where they are from as far as what their ethnic heritage is because we're looking for patterns to see if there's certain particular cannabinoid and terpene combinations that come from breeds that have been developed as it from particular land races to see if there's more of a propensity for those to work in certain areas over others for example if I when I'm dealing with there's certain groups of asian-americans that if we're working with things I know it doesn't sound directly related but from some of the Afghani strains we'll be more effective if I'm dealing with some that come from we have a lot of of people from Mexico in South America in the United States a lot of times the strains that they use will be much more effective with them that will come from strains that are like that are from like Panama red derivatives and things like that now the hybrids are all these different combinations where geneticists are looking to create you know whether whether they're motivated by wanting to have a patentable one of a kind their own strain or just because they're looking for superior genetics when I was growing up the cannabis was so weak compared to what it is now when I first was reintroduced to cannabis after being away from it for decades I was shocked at how little I had to use to achieve the same results and that's as a result of all this major breeding and breeding out some of the inferior and increasing the THC levels I mean you're finding we have flowers that come to us right now that might have 33 percent THC or THC a within the flower itself where in the past maybe it would have had three five seven percent THC so to an inexperienced user that can be quite significant so it's important to know what's in the medicine because maybe taking that second puff might be too much okay indica and sativa there's not really in indica is kind of a nebulous term these days because of all the different breeding programs that are out there so we say things like Afghan occur and things with strains like that more than we used it indica but for this purposes we're simply talking about the differences in the type of plants and the type of of terpenes that we're usually going to see resident within these indica plants tend to be shore bushier thicker where you wear your sativas are going to be more spindly narrow leaves they actually I think I have a slide in here that shows the examples now interestingly most of the um high CBD plants seem to be bred from sativa plants originally so like ac/dc which is a very very successfully standardized and stabilized strain that's very popular especially in like California where I'm from is a sativa based strain blue dream which is a high sativa dominant even though it has a little bit of Assam Beulah the blueberry that it was bred with it still is considered like for somebody like me who's very sensitive to sativas if I take it it's going to make me feel like I have heart palpitations like it's jumping out of my skin granddaddy purple is a very high THC strain but it's also very good for relaxing and used we use that a lot with cancer patients okay so activation of the cb1 receptor site cb2 receptor Dynes promotes homeostasis within the body I'm not going to go through this right now people I've already seen this same just about this same slide somebody else head up yesterday showing how the the majority of the cb1 receptor sites are within the red and within the central nervous system and the CB 2 is more in the immune and throughout the rest of the body so the THC Zechs is a lock to go in and activate the receptor sites where's the CBD is is it we're not really sure exactly how it acts on them that's why we have research that needs to be done and has been done to understand more and more about it but we do know that it is a antagonist so that if you've taken too much THC you can take some CBD and it'll bring you down okay so let's take a look at there's a lot of talk around THC in cancer or CBD and cannabis in general and cancer so what's happening in this situation is you have your your cb1 cb2 receptor sites which is indicated by this squiggly line here you have your cannabinoids that are that if the key is fit into the lock and it's activated the receptor site which starts this entire chemical cascade that goes through here it's like anyone that's ever played dominoes or done one of those things at the fair where you watch where it goes you don't need to know what's happening along the way that's way outside my paygrade but at the end of it all you have what's the important part and that is this right here which is apoptosis or programmed cell death you know you really want to make sure that that that you're that you're in if you take take this slide with you if you're going to see your oncologist and help them to understand that there really is medical science and understanding around what's precisely is happening when when you use cannabinoids in conjunction with other therapies to kill program cell death the other thing is the difference in the way that apoptosis works versus a chemotherapy drug or something like that as you is you have to be they have to watch how the speed at which they kill cancer cells when they use chemical therapies and radiations because there can be so much toxicity in the body from all this dead cells well with apoptosis you don't have that the cancer cells I'm not qualified to go into the complete explanation of the what and why but the cancer cell just either goes away and is replaced then with just a healthier cells okay now CBD doctor Sean McAllister is done a lot of work around the something called the id-1 gene and the ID one gene when its present in infants and when you're born that's a good thing but you don't want it to be present later on because what it is is that it's involved in the proliferation and Matassa sation of cells so on certain types of cancers there's a higher levels of id-1 gene and what we have found is that CBD cannabidiol is does a very good job of interfering with the translation of the ID one gene in keeping it from causing more cell proliferation and spreading of those now these are these are very loose in not very specific in an explanation what you can say oh if you have this then treat with that but we do know so far that if you if you look you'll find that the cancers that are most readily associated with presence of the id-1 gene this is the list here that you have now the importance of this why you would care is somebody who's going to use cannabis medicinally is because if you have for example breast cancer or hepatic hepatic carcinoma you can start out with a much higher level of CBD and a lower level of THC than you can on different types of cancers because the first thing you can do is you can block the cells from proliferating and Braque the cells from metastasizing the same time that you can use a much smaller amount of THC to get in there and cause the chemical cascade in resulting in apoptosis so this allows people to use much much lower levels you know you'll hear about people that you know there's the methods out there of the one-size-fits-all you take a gram a day and it works for some and it doesn't work for others well there's very good reasons why it doesn't work for some and it works for others and my theory is that this is a very big part of that okay now one of the things that I just want to one of the things that we've been doing is we've been tracking for many years what the actual the way the way that my practice works is a patient comes to us they fill out a extraordinarily extensive patient intake form it's very rigorous we ask it's about 13 pages long now it started out at 8:00 and it keeps getting longer because we keep realizing there's more questions that we need to ask so we've been getting this information about them and based upon their intake we are then able to make a determination of a starting point not a definite rocket end up there necessarily but a starting point on what their dose should be their dose goal should be also what sorts of cannabinoids and terpenoids that they're going to need and which err which particular strains are going to be most effective for them in this case here we're dealing with glioblastoma brain tumors and I'm showing starting at the working from the bottom up I'm going to show you the largest doses and the other thing that we've found is that we're doctors and traditional medicine have a tendency to want to say how many milligrams per kilogram when they're dosing we have found that it has a far greater correlation with the age of the patient than it does the weight of the patient right our youngest patients take the largest amounts of cannabinoids the oldest patients take the least amount of cannabinoids so in this case this was a well she was - when she came to us and now she's four she came to us initially for palliative care because she had such excruciating pain from her astrocytoma which is a form of glioblastoma by the way and so we started her out and lo and behold immediately there started being cell death so we said let's just go for it and let's see if we can if we can kill it well now she'd has only there's a little bit of necrosis they're seeing but without doing a biopsy they won't be able to tell for sure but so far they don't see anything and she just started school something that this family never thought she would be around to do she was taking 400 milligrams of THC and 350 milligrams of CBD each day now just to put that into terms of what that means as far as a dose if you're dealing with a gram of cannabis extract oil you can expect it to get extracted with ethanol because we do all of our extractions with 190 ethanol you could expect there to be somewhere between 50 and 75 percent realistically of THC within it assuming it's a high THC strain of course but you're going to expect it to be somewhere between fifty five hundred and seven hundred and fifty milligrams THC per gram so in this case she was taking one that she was taking about a little over half a gram of THC and one little over half a gram of CBD this female at this age at 28 she was at 200 milligrams and 100 milligrams by the way we standardized we always put the THC first in the CBD second so that when you are talking about it there's an accepted nomenclature so that you know you don't have to say somebody says oh yeah I'm taking 100 to 200 I'm not I might assume they're taking 100 THC and 200 CBD so we try to get people to standardize saying always the THC first it's about going through all these all the way getting up to here to an 88 year old man who was successful with treating and eliminating any signs of his glioblastoma with just 75 milligrams of THC and 30 milligrams of CBD a day as you can see there's a quite significant difference in what happens on the strains on the ages breast cancers also there's a quite a bit of difference here now these ones - at the asterisk at the bottom I'm not sure what happened to my note but that was that they were actually only interested in treating the side effects from chemotherapy so they were not looking at actually treating the disease itself now one of the things that we do is we ask there's five particular questions that are the most important that you can ask that you know somebody besides knowing what their diagnosis is to know what their present cannabis uses or their experience with cannabis know what pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals that they're on because you need to know what runs through the cytochrome p450 because it'll make the other pharmaceuticals much stronger if they go through that pathway know their age we have to know their age and then the last and most important thing is what is your objective what are you trying to accomplish because as a as a practitioners a caregiver we might have a very different goal for a patient than they have for themselves or they may just want to feel better they're not worried about living or trying to be unconscious or or do something else while they're trying to kill the the cancer cells they may just want to get rid of nausea or get rid of headache or whatever and so you have to be very respectful of what the desires and the dreams are of the actual patients now epilepsy is very complex and I I at one when I get a new epilepsy patient I'm always a little bit nervous because epilepsy is a symptom of many many many different diseases and so to see we'll say that you're treating epilepsy is is is a bit of a misnomer it's like saying treating pain well what's the pain from where's the pain caused from is it you know somebody might be having seizures as a result of having a brain tumor that they removed and it act of something in the brain they may have it from a car accident they might have it because they have drove a or Lennox Gaston syndrome or something like that and each one of those are slightly different in the treatment many many times with with epilepsy we also include th CA because there's also a lot of times there's inflammation and intestinal issues that can lead to that's like there's there's these things like the gaps diet and things that are really important to include when you're looking at treating these diseases it is a mind/body/spirit it has to be has to include diet it has to include lifestyle changes as well anytime you're treating any kind of disease you can't just give somebody cannabis and have them keep doing with everything else they've been doing and expect to have much of a lasting change but in epilepsy in particular you have the activation of the cb1 receptor sites which the shorts out the calcium ion pump and presynaptic neurons okay so people you hear a lot of this especially with with all the Charlotte's Web and things like that where people think that oh you just have to give CBD well even Charlotte's Web isn't Charlotte's Web anymore it started out being basically a variant of our four or ACDC of a cannabis based CBD and now they're Gro doing it from hemp well they've done it because they can have it in all these other countries where THC is not allowed well the problem is without a little bit of THC these kids are going back to having seizures you've got to have a little bit of THC this that's why the isolates don't work on their own and then here's an example of a of a seven-year-old little girl where she was able to take only ten point three milligrams of THC along with a 250 milligrams of the CBD and 10.3 might not sound like much but if you don't have that should be back to having seizures it is very very important there are some people as much as 1/3 of a milligram of THC is just enough to activate the cannabinoid receptor sites to take them back into a state of homeostasis or to help them achieve whatever it is their objective is so 10 milligrams is actually quite significant it's not what you're not going to get that from smoking you're going to get a lot more than that but like I said we're looking for the goal outcome of being homeostasis not getting high so we're not we're not interested in people feeling the medicine we just want to eliminate what their problems are so they go back to having to be normal to be neutral now here is intractable nerve pain there's five mechanisms involved okay it retards the electric electrochemical reactions with approval rate receptors interrupts pain signal at the dorsal root ganglion interrupts the pain signal to neuron and activates the cb2 at the leukocytes provides major anti inflammatory response and the psychoactive euphoric effect and short-term memory reduction mitigated stress response to pain I know that's a big mouthful right but you know people say I don't know why it works it just does well we do know why it works this is it this is why it works on Payne CBD of course has anti-inflammatory mechanisms that with all disease you're going to have inflammation because that's how the body goes to fight the areas where there's dis-ease and so as an anti-inflammatory that's far far more powerful than a steroid having CBD in your toolbox is extremely important when you're dealing with chronic pain in this case I'm going to show you the actual dosing for this woman the 78 year old female when she came to us she had intractable nerve pain she had not slept through the night in over 20 years she was a suicidal because she did not see how she could possibly go on like this anymore so I know this is a lot of numbers and it's hard to read and I apologize I'm not much on the slides but so first thing that we gave her was Swiss gold now this was a high CBD CBD CBD strain and it had this happened to be infused into olive oil so it's not going to be that can extract because when you're dealing with something where you want to get a very specific precise dose and you're dealing with very small numbers of cannabinoids you need to have them in a form that people can measure accurately if you're dealing with something that has 700 milligrams per gram how are you going to identify the difference between 2 milligrams and 3 milligrams it's almost impossible our scales are just not that sensitive even with us requiring our patients to use a scale that goes to 0.0 0.7 ufff so this this helps to infuse it into oil and that way a person can have consistent dosing over time so in this case we wanted her to have three doses a day with 15 milligrams of the CBD within the Swiss gold itself because it had point O 7 percent THC and it owes well within the tincture oath excuse me the infused oil by taking the 15 milligrams here three times a day excuse me 15 milligrams per day in three doses so it'd be three doses of five milligrams or perhaps one of just one or two milligrams a little bit of the more and making sure that we throughout the day sometimes they take more at night more in the morning whatever but this is the goal for the day she still got through that a residual of one point five milligrams of THC so she was getting a little bit of it there we introduced a second medicine it was called it was the names don't mean anything these this is the only thing that means something to me right here and that's this number which is that's my lab test that's what shows that I know exactly what's in this medicine to the best of our current lab technology as every medicine is is traceable back to a standardized lab test that measures cannabinoids and terpenoids within the medicine so in this particular one I was looking to give her THC a I was looking for the anti-inflammatory effects of THC a and also the fact that it lends itself to the over well well well being so I wanted to give her 15 milligrams of that there was a little bit of CBD within this particular OG two times s medicine and so she was able when she got the 15 milligrams in one dose it had such a small amount that it wasn't even measurable of what the CBD was but then when I came over here also to look at the residual of the THC I would needed to take into account she was to do that same this is all the same medicine by the way that she was going to get 3.8 milligrams of the THC in here and then showing what the CBD the reason that's important to do this is if our initial goal can I go backwards how do I go backwards here okay thank you because if you look here the goal was to have her have 15 milligrams of THC a 5 milligrams of THC and 15 milligrams of CBD I needed to be able to get that with the combinations taking into account the cannabinoids that are in be coming from one source or another so as you see here there was a one point five milligrams that came from here I had to get her the rest of it somewhere else so I was able to get her the rest of it in this THC a strain which the three point eight so it equals just about a total so it's it's four point it's little over five milligrams five and change that she ended up with the point is you can take a whole plant medicine a whole plant extract infused whatever and you can get down to the most minut and specific numbers of cannabinoids so and this is what your doctor wants to see this is what your doctor wants to hear and this is when your doctor is going to understand that you're actually using this as a medicine and not just rolling the dice I like to say the difference between what we do and what most people do is they go to they least call it a skittles party where people would come and they would raid their parents medicine cabinets and they would throw all the drugs in a bowl and people would go and they would take and they would have a party then you had kids overdosing beyond you know heart medicine and birth control pills and mommy's little helpers and it was horrible and a lot of times these do the disasters you're seeing our people that are treating this like a skittles party instead of like a red Aledo scible medicine unfortunately you have to have testing labs and within one of the big things that seems to be lagging across the world is testing labs and I you know if I was going to be an evangelist for anything it would be for the fact that we have to have accurate testing across the globe where you can't buy a higher THC number by paying more to a lab or they actually know how to clean their machines in between different tests so that things are accurate I mean there has to be better standards on that because people like me depend upon those numbers to make dosing decisions and at the end of the day if you have a patient that's extraordinarily sensitive they're going to suffer if they don't have if we don't have the right information okay now here it is for insomnia you can read through the way it works for it is that obviously you're going to want to use strains that are higher in the Mersey like we talked about before that go through the break through the blood-brain barrier and have a very calming Zombieland effect and then also higher CBN like I said you can push the cbn with time and sunlight in order to and one of the things about you take this year's harvest and take a little bit and set it aside and don't store it quite so well don't do such a good job and that way you can have more CBN next year when you're going or later on where you're going to make medicines for nighttime or for sleep so the in this case it was a six year old male and we were just giving him the straight granddaddy purple he was taking 25 milligrams and sleeping like a baby okay hypertension activates the cb1 and cb2 receptor sites and then vasodilation of blood vessels lowering blood pressure caused relief of stress by blocking production of acetylcholine within the brain and slows down the neurotransmission at the synaptic cleft so one of the things that that reasons that THC works so well for people with PTSD is because of this interference with the acetylcholine in the brain that is what causes short term memory or helps with our short term memory and you know if I don't know about anyone that's ever smoked a lot of pot you get you know you're smoking it then all of a sudden you start a sentence and you can't get to the end of your sentence you can't remember what you were saying that's the that's the interference with the acetylcholine you can take a supplement called Siddha choline which is readily available from Jaros and other companies I'm sure there'd be somewhere over here where you could get set of choline I just absolutely do not recommend it for cancer patients because of the vasodilation you don't want to have act with cancer cells so you don't want to give this at a cone in that case but when here what we're dealing with is when one of the reasons I think that dr. Missoula I can't remember the exact quote but he said one of the gifts of THC is the is the ability to forget and when you when you have like a vet for example that's at PTSD what's really happening is they're in a continuous diet of state of fight-or-flight like the saber-tooth tiger is chasing them and that's why our brain we have that in our brain is - so that we know when we're under a tap to fight well with PTSD you just kind of stay in that case some people with hypertension depending on what the causes are and everything else you got a little bit of the same sort of situation is where you get to get him out of that that that fight-or-flight sort of mode and THC is just beautiful at doing that this guy started out with 30 milligrams of THC and he was at 13 of CBD per day and infused olive oil and I want to show you an interesting and I like I say I hope you can follow my bad pictures but I want to show you how we were able to recreate this over and over again initially we had him on this strain here and it was his initial dose of the 30 milligrams a day of the THC and that because of what was in this particular strain itself that gave him 13 milligrams of CBD and it just he was doing one dose at night before bed and he had beautiful response he was able to this was a man that was only 57 years old and he was going to be have enforced into disability retirement because his blood pressure was so bad and he was on so many medications that were not working he's still at work he's been he's been a patient of mine now since middle of 2011 and he's still actively at work he's still haven't doing great he's off of most of the medications he still is on one or two other medications but compared to where he was it's quite phenomenal so after we ran out of this one and we didn't have any more cotton candies because that's that's the nature of cannabis is every time you get a new plant even if it is the same plant even if it is standardized there's going to be variants in it and because we are not our own growers we don't have a vertical integrated supply sometimes we have to wait for whatever we one of our growers grows for us now we've moved more to standardization but back then so I had to figure out how to get him this dose with what I had at the time and at the time I had cookies which is a derivative of Girl Scout cookies and ACDC was able to mix the different compound it in such a way where I could recreate by using just it's just mathematics it's just math and a little chemistry too by putting together a little bit of the of the cookies in the ACDC I was able to reproduce for him precisely the 30 milligrams and in this case 15 so he got two more milligrams of CBD which is quite inconsequential when you're dealing with CBD and he still had the one dose a day so he still was able to have that same uninterrupted a success and experience with his medicine reliable dosing just like he had from the first one it wasn't like playing skittles or having to start from scratch it may take a day or so before you feel exactly like you did before but if anyone who wears glasses and has ever gotten their new prescription even though it feels great it might take an hour to before your adjust to seeing through them quite as naturally we then the third time had to do it using Pepe LePew and Swiss gold as you can see totally different numbers on the percentages that were on the actual medicine but we were able to mix them in such a way where he got his 30 milligrams of THC and 15 of CBD exactly the same way first case he knew to how much to take a second case he knew that his daily dose would be these two mixed together and then here this much was the actual donation Crohn's disease now this one is a little bit more complicated some these people tend to do really really well with inhaled THC they still need systemic absolutely 100% we talked about having a little bit of CBD tea for the inflammation so that take it internally this woman here I had her on 30 milligrams of THC and 15 milligrams of CBD she was able to use them systemically and control her symptoms and and have great relief to wasn't running to the bathroom she was able to go to work she had been working for months out of her house because she couldn't make it to the bathroom in time from her desk to the restroom so she was having to work and then she was able to go back to work and be much more productive I have another Crohn's patient who has a lot of like you said here workshops about tendency towards abscesses he has a fistula that just won't heal so we've been doing part of the CBD in the form of a suppository at the same time that he's taking some of the CBD and THC sublingually in the form of an extract and if he has breakthrough heat pain or breakthrough symptoms he can just take a couple of puffs off a vaporizer of the same exact extract that he's taking and he's fully functional again PTSD ADHD Tourette's we talked about how that works before the 50 year old female 15 milligrams and five milligrams so you're as you can see these are nowhere near the types of doses that people that talk about a gram a day or one of anything or Gebbie these are quite small amounts for people to still be fully functional and to have a incredible medical results from the medicine so I like to say here is that in conclusion cannabis is greater than the sum of its parts isolates are not the same if you don't have the entourage effect you do not get the benefit of cannabis the endo and EXO or phyto cannabinoids play a significant role in treating almost all diseases all diseases you have if there is disease in the body there is a lack of balance in the body if there's like a balance there's not homeostasis cannabis is designed to achieve or the endocannabinoid system is designed to ensure homeostasis if the body is endocannabinoid deficient you use phyto cannabinoids it's that straightforward doesn't mean it's going to cure everything it doesn't mean everything's going to go away but it's certainly going to make a significant difference in your outcomes when you're including all of the systems and your healing it's also important to select the right strains if somebody who has PTSD uses a sativa and of course this is a generalization it's not the case with all because sometimes exact opposite they use a high sativa that has alpha pining in it it's going to be very calming the same way that Ritalin given to somebody with ADHD it's very calming somebody who doesn't have that will be very stressed out by it for a vet it's perfect somebody that has sleep problems you're not going to give them a sativa you're going to give them more of the indica type strains it's also possible to dose correctly and consistently I think we've shown that in you can have individualized treatment plans for patients separating this THC and CBD doses I didn't really go into this but we separate them out by two hours whenever possible because CBD is a Agnon is an antagonist for the cb1 receptor sites and THC is an agonist so we don't want them working against each other and we feel that we're a we've been successful in keeping the doses much lower by dousing them separately and when I say that THC and CBD I'm talking about dominant strains obviously we're talking about whole plant here and then all cannabis and I should have all this in capitalized bright purple that all cannabis must be lab tested to guarantee the outcomes that we're looking for and without THC most diseases would not be treatable with cannabis so I I'm quite disturbed by what I see the worldwide trend of CBD only legalization and because it's leaving the vast majority of all diseases untreated which is really a human rights violation for so many people not having equal access to care so and then I like to show you here is our team out on a celebration one night so we're all a little casual here but here you've got as many of you might know who Justin candor is he's written several books on the endocannabinoid system and cancer he's he's just fantastic and he has now come to work with us and we're very happy to have him there's another individual who's not here and then cured anyone that contacts that she's our patient advocate and she's just amazing Bianca's evokes families did the canna Costa in Costa Rica and she came and interned with us and has now gone back to Costa Rica taking that knowledge with her our lab chemist who's looking quite professional here Jeff stuart-smith Laurie Hernandez and then of course myself thank you very much okay sure anybody have any questions I'm happy to address them yes hello hi do you see a gender issue with high doses of CBD in your work like women react differently than men to 2cb dear to all cannabis no - super CBD yeah it's interesting you should ask that because I don't think that there is a gender issue I think that it's one of the fun things that I don't know yet and I'm collecting the data to find out my background by the way is I'm a process engineer so I'm a data junkie and I've actually built software around this so that we can figure all this out one of three things is going to happen with CBD it's either going to make you feel very invigorated very energized it's going to make you feel very sleepy or you're not going to feel anything and at this point right now even though I've treated hundreds and hundreds of people we don't know enough yet to know who's going to be which I do have a theory on it that people that like the sativa is the more of the higher alpha pining type strains and lemonade strains those people tend to be much sleepier as a result of C be using CBD than people that like the higher indica strains right now it is simply a theory but I've not seen a gender relationship with it Eliza valchek project Phoenix Poland I have a question related to Boas vector question about patients who react reversibly to cannabinoids profile can you talk a little bit about that could you expand on what you mean by opposite sativa work for them differently than for most of the people an indica work differently and also other cannabinoids like CBD make them high THC not right well those are those are two different things let me go with the first one you mentioned something in your top before that was a lot of our experience has been that people that are not able to adjust to cannabis or because they're not willing and able to let go they have this fear and this need to control and part of the negative or adverse reactions that we experience with cannabis or people who are afraid of just experiencing what's going to happen without being able to I don't know it's it's something that's foreign to me but it didn't used to be I used to be one of those people I couldn't stand cannabis I hated the way it made me feel I hated everything about it I couldn't understand why anybody would ever want to use this horrible drug until I took two puffs once when I was in about a level nine pain and my pain went down to about a two and I was like okay there's something here well the next time I did it I took about four puffs and that was way too much and I went into that whole paranoid horrible miserable feeling that and everybody had gone to bed and I was all alone and I was scared and then I thought you know what there's millions of people that are using this and love it I'm going to just pay attention I'm just going to observe and pay attention without judgment and see what's going on and just meditate and just go with it and it was transformative and I never have had a negative experience since if I take if I have used a cannabis strain that didn't agree with me I know it's the cannabis and it's not me and there's ability to separate out from the drug and its effect from how about from me I don't even know how to articulate it is an incredible freedom people who have PTSD ADHD a DD you know a series of other Tourette's they will often respond the exact opposite of what others would the same exact strains I give city and part of the reason for that is the difference in the acetylcholine in the brain taking the person that short-term memory-loss takes a person out of the fight-or-flight and it's very calming the same way that Ritalin which is a speed will make them feel mellow yeah now on the CBD just don't know enough yeah I'm freezing I'm curious in my work I've seen this in rare instances but there are some people that are allergic to indica strains and not sativa strains and vice versa do you have some commentary on that yeah they're allergic oftentimes what you're saying is there's a prevalent terpene within those strains that the people like for example I'm very allergic to alpha-pinene and so strains that have alpha pining in it make me very sick that one of the things I saw here and I was going to suggest is that you have people wear masks when they're trimming because that can also be an issue that can cause yeah yeah the other side of this I just wanted to expand a bit there is one individual I had personal experience with who could rub it on her skin and because she was allergic to one one variety and she would know just by rubbing it on her skin which variety not to use as medicine right right absolutely absolutely yeah that's one of the reasons it's important to lab tests so that we can find out what cannabinoids and terpenoids are in there so that people know which ones to avoid is mitches which ones to have yeah is the reaction to the trip annoyed yes okay for example I can't have anything that has pine at all or anything that has : e which is the yellow sticky because that also by the way just so you know I have pages and pages and pages of references so if anybody once I'm happy to share them with them but yeah it's the same reason that you can't have all plants and all foods and people have all sorts of allergies and like we looked at with the terpenes before they appear in lots of other things and those might be the ones that you can't eat those foods or use other things that have those products in them as well yeah what else I thank you I was wondering you've been talking quite nice very nicely about terpenes but I would like you to highlight what's the best method to keep such a volatile compounds for patients so for example would you recommend something like juicing or rather than in doing tinctures like what's the best method to keep terpenes because it's it's quite a matter when we do as structs and so on that's a very very good question solvents are selective strippers each one's going to select strip something else the reason some groups like butane is because it strips THC very well I personally wouldn't use anything I won't even use you know Pam on my food I wouldn't use butane in my medicine if you infuse oils correctly and you you are careful to decarboxylate oh god thank you I love you I'm so cool sorry it's I'm from California I don't know if that is you then do with it but um yeah the when you infuse directly and if you make sure that you keep your temperatures at such a way that your decarboxylated to read to drop off the acid molecules you're going to do the best job of keeping the original profile of the plant the problem is you lose so much because it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't take up so much of it now if you we've been working on methods for years on doing the ethanol extractions and we've got it down to pretty much of an art form that we were able to maintain the same profile that we have in the flowers into the extracts but it's very very difficult to do that it's extremely difficult I would say stay away from all toxic solvents hexane butane you know any of those ice oh my god stay away from all of those and stick stick with the ones that are at least organic in them and if you keep your temperatures right and you keep your time's right and it takes some time to figure that out then you can do a pretty good job of keeping the profile there's no there's no perfect way to do it I wish there was I see some people that are like some organizations or doing what I call Frankenstein medicine which is where they're adding back in these artificial you know you know from China these terpenes artificial terpenes and all to recreate profiles and they're calling them medicine with full profiles but the reality is the cannabis plant was designed in such a way perfectly it's a perfect design in its perfect design that when it's heated and it's heated correctly it's going to transform it to exactly what it's supposed to be the same way that when you smoke it you get just a very brief amount of the terpenes that come from that but you're getting exactly the amount you're supposed to be getting so I wouldn't be that concerned about it as long as you're using healthy methods and correct temperatures and times yeah anybody else how precise do you have to be in your work I will explain let's say that 15 milligrams of whatever is good for a given patient is it possible that it will turn out that 14 is not enough and 16 is too much or it's not that accurate it that's a very good question it depends it depends on the person it depends what you're treating I mean when I'm when we're giving somebody 400 milligrams of THC I would guess that the reality is sometimes they have 390 sometimes they have 420 I mean even though we try to be exact but when you're dealing with somebody who has a it's very very hyper sensitive one milligram chi might be all the difference in the world we in we standardized as close as you can do with the full plant are infused at approximately 10 milligrams per mil so what that means is and since they're infused into olive oil and we've done the measures if you have between 28 and 30 drops per mil okay actual drops you sit and count them that's how many times it takes to get a milliliter of oil so that means that each drop is going to be about a third of a milligram I might I might have an initial goal for a patient of five milligrams they may never get up to a milligram before they've achieved what they need to from the medicine so in their case if it's one or two off it can be all the difference between success and failure when you're dealing with your higher and you're dealing with a month once again let's go back to what the objective is if the objective is to kill cancer then if a couple more isn't going to matter but if your objective is to get rid of your chronic pain and still go to work one or two might make all the difference in the world and the other thing is you want to have repeatable and consistent responses with people so they can go about having their regular lives the vast majority of people don't want to come to a conference they don't want to do it they want someone to tell them exactly what to do and that's what they want to do you we want to think that people are more active in their medicine but the truth is most people just want to take a pill and call you in the morning so that's that's what we're trying to do is to help them to do that but not have to do it with pharmaceutical type cannabis or pharmaceuticals in general but to be able to do it it's like the best of both worlds hello I want to ask the first question will be about the solvents which you recommend for using for the X X like you have mentioned a some alcohol I mean I think yes and second one will be able do you recommend for the patients which are sick which have a prosthetic answer or bone cancer in skeleton metastasis the combination of terpenoids CBD or n THC compulsion like which would it should be it should be one to one I mean the combination of THC and CBD or two to one who do you recommend for this patient kind of patients this was for bone cancer and prostate the prostate well prostate cancer let me see if I can go back there prostate cancer interestingly wrong direction is one of the ID one gene cancers so the first thing I would do I can't tell you an exact dose because there's a lot other information I would need to know but I can tell you that in that case I would probably start out with a 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 ratio of THC to CBD with a much higher I guess I'm going the wrong direction it's stuck anyway I can't get up there again but the so that's going to be anytime you got the ID one you can start by using a much higher CBD with a lower THC if it doesn't work we I would try that for one scan cycle and then see how that works and then for bone cancer we have you said bone cancer I'm going to go with the higher THC and the lower CBD I'm going to do at least a two to one on that and see how that goes yeah and as far as the solvents I methanol in all the way I just you know 190 ethanol we've got beautiful extractions I know somebody might some people might get higher THC levels but at the expense of the rest of it and it's also the expense of garbage in garbage out if you can't put it into your body on its own don't put it into your medicine it's kind of our theory there have been studies that have shown that olive oil is an extremely good infusion and then we also use MCT oil which is the medium chain triglycerides you get from we stay away from the palm oils and we go with with the coconut derived MCT and we'll make some CBD and THC a especially THC a for the epilepsy patients you have to be a little more kep because it's it's ketone affect so it's very helpful to use the MCT for that okay all right did it okay thank you sorry one more just one more question very quickly is is there any value to industrial hemp CBD would you give it any like importance I mean we're seeing a lot of CBD injustice from industrial hemp does it have any medicinal value as it were is it justice are we going to see these companies in two years time if somebody lives in the United States and they happen to be in a legal state okay and in California let's say where I am and they have a choice between CBD derived from cannabis sativa or CBD a rot derived from industrial hemp there's not even a question you're going to want to go with cannabis derived CBD but if somebody is in a place where they have no other options as long as we know that there aren't heavy metals involved and passed the huge pesticides and then it's been extracted correctly it's it's you know it's for serious illness no but if somebody's just has like four topicals and four foods and things like that if they want to use it it's fine I don't consider I think that industrial hemp is exactly that industrial it's for textiles and fuel and fibers and building materials and all that the fact that it has CBD in it is kind of beside the point so ideally you have to have the whole plant including the THC especially since most diseases are not effectively treated without a little bit of THC so my preference would be that they're industrial hemp would be used for industrial purposes and cannabis would be used for medicine", "npFJ6jAkf5o": "[Music] love

had me well quick then she got to be able to take her break but the long-term coveted symptoms that's the thing that people aren't really talking about too and i think that's something that the we can always find some relief in that the the thing we always come back to on the show and that's you know the cbd and the thc and the in the co the co effect of having them together the synergistic effect of having cannabis see thc and then having the hemp cbd in there too there's a good there's a good way to mix it too and uh there's some there's some high cbd thc products out there now too you know some some strains that are grown that are almost as much thc or cbd as they have thc in them so we're going to go into some of that and hell there's even smokeable cbd flour for people right now and you know so cov code's rough but we're here to help you get through this this last [ __ ] tail end of it praise god if we're if we're towards the end of it and uh you know we'll be here to keep you guys up to date on the edibles and then and the reviews and then as always we like to start off the show with a little news so uh first time back in four weeks there's a lot of [ __ ] news uncovered and uh you know we're gonna jump straight into texas right now uh you know the texas hemp scene is just blowing up right now and uh we got a uh a guest coming on later to talk about it oil well cbd but i mean this goes this goes right into it and you know wex texas hemp could be more marketable in the coming years um they're saying that uh making industrial hemp a profitable commodity for west texas agriculture community has been a goal for the texas hemp growers association and it's looking like more happen this year with the potential partnership of area grocers and other companies emerge farmers interested in growing hemp in 2021 and on are going to have their first and legally grow crop that had to work out number of logistical such as finding a seed that would grow in the climate i mean texas is probably not too hospitable in certain areas when it comes to that crop and then finding a buyer before investing the acres is even a harder thing to do so you know trying to be outguessed by the weather and trying to figure out what way you should go and shouldn't go with the plant the group encountered several businesses that were interested in partnering and then they basically to avoid scams and delta ag the only full-service manufacturer of hemp and raw goods in the country partnered with texas hemp growers association last year to help make the process run smoothly and to be a success including uh providing a fully equipped processing facility in slanton that was up to running in the inaugural harvest so a delta ag is out there trying to help people that want to convert from the classic crops that they were growing in the south and move on to uh you know some of these other unique crops like hemp and you know hemp hemp is an absorbing plant it takes the salts in um heavy metals out of the ground and you know there's something that you can do for your geographical location by pulling out some of those you know harmful to the environment crops you know crop crop cropping is not always successful for the environment sometimes you can do a lot of harm just by the crop that you're going in areas it's about doing things sustainably and you know making that switch it looks like ag is helping them to switch that over and it's that's a big thing to step it's a big step in the right direction when it comes to texas and the way of farming when it comes to hemp and who knows maybe even possibly a legal cannabis someday let's take it up to seattle for a minute um a dea uh the dea is being sued by a doctor who wants permission to uh give his uh mushroom master mushrooms to patients a seattle doctor hoping to expand access to the uh silocillian mushrooms is terminally um terminally ill patients is taking on the drug enforcement agency and the court's agency recently denied the application to legally use psychedelics for end-of-life treatments attorneys filed a lawsuit in the u.s circuit court of appeals arguing that the dea's denial of the application was unfounded they're asking judges to throw out the decision and force the agency to expeditiously reconsider the accommodate the valid requests made by the qualified health providers for therapeutic use of eligible um mushrooms for people at end of life it's a first of its kind lawsuit and lead attorney katherine tucker said on a press call that the case is about seeking to ensure patients with serious ill life-threatening illnesses they're able to realize the promise of state and federal right to try the law that was already approved for them to have access to these therapeutic drugs you know the push has been expanded for patient access began last year and you see what they're doing they're already trying to put up the red tape so even when the voters say yes we want people to be able to have this they're going to find that some way to bureau to bureaucraticize the whole thing and slow down access to these uh things that were proven not proven they were voted for by the voters you know so it just goes to show let's go to albuquerque you want to go to albuquerque no me neither but we're still we're gonna we're gonna talk about this just because it's like they're still talking about plant counts they're still talking about legalization and how to do it and there's a committee debate over recreational marijuana that was taking place on monday night and it's now it's going to be pushed back again because they're having a hard time coming to the [ __ ] stance on this both senate bills 288 and health bill 12 still on the table with lawmakers are tasked to review every detail of the lengthy bill and basically it's more than 100 pages long but it's it's it's important because part of the reason the bill is hurting because it's trying to hurt micro business licenses and with the amendment that their plant count can only be at 200 is in pricely i mean it's precisely the reason why the communities around the state have the ability to go against the industry in in this limited plant count and at the end of the day you need to access the water you need access to land you need the know-how you need to know how to do it the representative said but you know you've got to be able to you got to be able to take the handcuffs at some point and you know these micro businesses the the 200 plant count you know they're trying to fight to raise that and at the end of the day if you're not furthering the knowledge of uh researching this and allowing the correct amount of plants so that people can even do research development in a you know a true study with a trial and a control and actual system to it then you know what's the point of even doing the r d for this so increase the plant count albuquerque it's amazes me we're still talking about plant counts in this day but albuquerque's a little bit behind the times but let's go to illinois for a second all right this one i could get into the first on-site consumption lounge is going in over in in illinois so this is in cesar illinois when driving through downtown sessor you'll notice the old bank lounge and the building is getting a complete rod remodel and it's going to be the luna lounge in sesor the lounge is an on-site cannabis consumption lounge and the owner holly roader said that it's the only one in the state and that it's the only one probably in the country so rotor now living in california grew up in sessor she said that she believes in the perfect location to open up this micro on-site consumption bar and she also said that the ceo of the cannabis course a course for teaching cannabis and education camp treatments and training she's also in charge of that so the mayor assessor is on board he's excited for the new business and they said luna lounge is going gonna work so exciting times in illinois if you didn't know about that then uh [ __ ] time to get up to uh to sessor and get in the [ __ ] first consumption lounge remember they opened up here in la and then they shut down open up and shut down if anyone knows one tap in tag me i want to know about that consumption lounge in la all right last last not least in the 50 states you can't forget about arizona this is our number one story of the week actually the adult use cannabis sales hit 2.9 million in the first 10 days the adult use cannabis sales in arizona was through the charts in those days and it was it was a huge [ __ ] deal for them to be able to be permitted and according to the figures released by the state after 73 of 130 licenses were approved by arizona department of health the medical health or dispensaries operators were granted the first crack at the due adult uses the arizona recreational market launched less than three months ago after voters approved the sales during the november's election there's a delay in the arizona recreational sales reporting because marijuana taxes are collected a month after transaction errors so this delay the state collected over 220 000 in tax revenue so the marijuana business daily projects that arizona's recreational market will reach 375 to 400 million in the first year of sales so way to go arizona keep on stacking it on and while we're on arizona st you got that phone number i emailed you yeah i got it you know one of my favorite things to do is keep the stores on their toes so we're gonna make a quick phone call um and you know see if see if our store is paying attention and uh we'll do a little quick st patrick's day prank call got got our friends out there at a phoenix hydro in in phoenix arizona so phx i dro yeah i know they're always they're always quick-witted so they won't take no [ __ ] for me so this could get ugly really quick maybe i'll maybe i'll just go straight and ask for the manager i think that's the way to go [Music] this could get ugly because it's say patrick's day we like to spread a little good cheer talk about some lucky charms and get our get our smoke on of

we good all right give me a thumbs up when we're ready all right we're back farm to table cannabis dsp radio we got colin on the line from oilwell cbd doing a big things big things in texas so colin first of all let me introduce you to farm to table cannabis and our dfz radio land listeners why don't you say what's up hello how are you nice to meet you we appreciate you taking some time to come on the show today we know the scene is popping out there in texas right now and you know there's a lot of legislation going on it seems like there's been a lot of you know back and forth with the local officials there's been some sense of cooperation but there's also uh they also make it really hard to do business too at the same time too so um you know just to give everyone an idea what oil well is all about you know you guys are you guys are a retail store doing um cbd and smokable flowers correct so um i mean we help uh canada's brands actually launch as uh cannabis brands like we create cannabis companies we do you know like uh the design we help them i mean with their infrastructure and stuff like that i mean as a byproduct of having a brand i just want to clarify i mean we've we ended up with you know like our store area how you said uh it's a little bit different of an experience we have a grow we have an outdoor area and stuff like that so as a byproduct we have an in-store experience but i wouldn't say that you know like we were just i wouldn't want to limit us just if that's okay to being just called a retail outlet for sure but yeah absolutely yeah for sure marketing's so important now and you know for a brand to get off the ground you know you've got to be able to know how to market yourself to your demographics and you know that's kind of the that's the service you guys are offering in a retail setting so it's it's one thing to be able to have a you know uh office where you could come in but you guys have actual products on display in your package yeah exactly displayed yeah for sure and exactly i appreciate that yeah for in you know this is our gallery and someone actually i it was really cool that they actually like noticed that and they said the same thing they were like oh this is like an art gallery and it's like yeah you know like we want people just to appreciate all the aspects of beauty and we don't you know if we come up with a product and want to test it out you know what i mean like we have our own people that you know really want our product you know and so um you know like we don't have to wait for stores to give us permission to put our product on the shelf and stuff like that so um you know gives us control over our own downline of customers and so the whole experience that we want to be able to provide for sure in addition to you know helping market and brand a company you guys also have some background in the sourcing department right so not only is it just not only is it just oh hey we can slap a sticker on something but talk about a little bit of you guys do with sourcing and how you're able to you know control everything from marketing all the way to production yeah yeah um that's a great question because i really think that makes us different i mean uh there's you know like i'm i'm always gonna be straight up you know like what you see is what you get um you know but there you know like everybody that i trust around is here you know i mean not everybody's here but you know like you know chase over here you know i mean like we control everything and this is just how we do it you know and to be honest we don't really give a [ __ ] how anybody else does it you know like this is just how we do it and we do it very well you know we care and you know we don't we don't really you know like have we don't go looking for business and i i don't go hunting for good prices you know i i have you know like at this point i've been lucky enough to align myself and been you know like it had people that have gained confidence to give me the opportunity to just work with pure material and good material and you know like work at it at a fair price you know knowing that i'm not the biggest or we're not the biggest but you know we take that and we adapt that you know our own way whether that's you know the look but whether that's even more importantly like the contents like the terpenes and the you know like the other properties i mean and we're doing it all in a illegal state but we're doing it with him and you know like people need to understand that shit's not a fad you know like we have you know our own you know one-to-one cbd the thc formula that we boost with cbg and we cook it all up ourselves you know like we have fun and do all these different you know like strains of you know like it's just different methods of getting it in you know like even if that sometimes just simply is you know just making a fun edible you know that people can enjoy and people enjoy the experience you know like this is our small machine but you know so even sometimes with that you know we have a much bigger version obviously when we're doing larger things but you know people enjoy the experience of knowing that you know not only do we have a line of products but you know um you know like we do custom uh things for people you know based on their needs and a lot of times you know like get it right and they're not hurting people either way and it's just good stuff you know well and it's obvious that you come from a background in business and it's clear that you do marketing very well but um let's die let's dive a little bit deeper into your past if you will let's go on the time machine and talk about you know where your first love for the culture and for the plant came from and how you were able to adapt that into marketable products that you're able to bring to the public um really honestly like i grew up on the border in mexico so you know just um you know like there's not a lot of jobs there and um you know uh product of your environment yeah you know and that but really like uh that's like a cool thing you know because it just gave me a different vision of like you know like even the visions that you know like the work you know like i mean we have the same scorpion stamp that i have on my body that i have on my branding and on my products you know it comes from a different thing you know and uh it just really means something and so where we're not you know maybe officially scientists and stuff like that i mean like we grew up seeing this stuff and you know um it's just you know like yeah i mean it's just more important not to us at a different level having been involved through that and you know it's a it's just a really important thing um you know i can dig deeper but you know what i mean well kind of a piggyback question on that because that was you know that was really well said and you know coming from where you come and i imagine overcoming what you've been able to in certain situations how you know how how do you think marketing applies to that and what do you think is more important um marketing at all costs or holding on to that culture um the culture really to be honest because um like that is your marketing if there you know or maybe it's not i i don't know i don't know what like the right answer is to that like i mean but we just treat it like we treated the weed game you know which is if your [ __ ] isn't really really good then people don't want it and and they know if it works for them like you know at this point we're a little bit more you know mature and focused like we have a product for women's menstrual cycle called moon and um you know it really does get rid of like next to instantly like this the you know the the symptoms of yeah or the ailments of women's menstrual cycles and [ __ ] you know what i mean like it's a it's a different thing you know no um but uh you know like if our product didn't work we'd have a lot of pissed off people you know finding a lot of reasons to [ __ ] on us at least on the internet and tell us that we were foolish like i mean so to me simple principles of like just achieving what the [ __ ] we said we were gonna do you know like and um you know like that that was i knew that you know like i mean i have a back and so we so we you know do really well on searches but you know not everybody necessarily is a prime fit as a business partner and you know like it's important that that uh you know that we just remember why this is important and why this is available in the region yeah yeah you know it makes a lot of sense so like when it comes to the city and the community i guess the whole state how have you guys been accepted i think really well really to be honest um um and uh you know what's really important is you know um you know especially you know we're even you know we have people from california and las vegas um that are even coming to us for knowledge you know and for and to work with them to start their business and there's and again there's no chip on the shoulder i just think it's notable that we've achieved at least that much you know like proven expertise and just making anything happen but again i think that people have seen the hype and they smell what the hype is and they know when there's something that's not just totally [ __ ] full of [ __ ] and uh you know like that that's i don't know i don't pass that we just have fun with our image and try to get people to forget that it's not quote-unquote cool guy weed and [ __ ] you know like it's it is what it is it's cannabis you know i think that's what separates you from one of the some of the other guys that are just white labeling and they just want to get their name out and they're clout chasing really hard and just doing everything they can to try to bring something to the market regardless of if it's really good for the market and i appreciate them being able to kind of um sift through the [ __ ] and you having control over what goes in allows you to bring stuff to the market that you know you see would actually benefit the market and so you know that that being said what is gonna separate your guys's products from some of the other guys um when it comes to like this just picking a product up off the shelf you know you know about the process that goes into growing the hemp and that you pick and you guys so you know what makes you guys process a little bit better um you know like you know like so someone will say like so so what we have a vape cartridge you know like i would say you know okay let's let's start with the sheer thing like i don't try to save money you know which is which goes to get against i guess like economic grain you know like i want to spend money you know on my on my on my sources you know like it's it's i don't want cheap [ __ ] i do not want to save money on my cartridges you know i don't want cheap metals i don't want things that are going to hurt people i don't want cheap [ __ ] flour you know gr you know so i don't pay cheap prices you know and i want you know the farmers that are the best ones in the industry to contact me because they know that i pay the prime [ __ ] you know and even then you know again i've sorted through it and i'm done and you know like i'm i've just put in the leg work to where i don't have to go hunting for you know sources i don't i don't try to have a hundred thousand products i think people want a couple of effective and quality ways to use the product and you know like we know who we deal with because we really really [ __ ] with them and then you know like we don't [ __ ] with anybody else and if they tell us a price is a price you know like the [ __ ] always doesn't always have to be a haggle if it's fair and the shit's helping people we're all going to win we're all going to eat you know well that's something too people are thinking about the farmers right now they're the only class where people are paying top price for their equipment and they're having to pay for shipping both ways the farmers get the [ __ ] into the stick every time we got it hard but those guys got it rough what are some of the challenges you've seen from some of the hemp farmers and and really any black market cultivators in in your area too like what are the biggest challenges right now i mean obviously with the way the laws are but you know on a day-to-day um i think that like a lot you know like but with every challenge there's like that challenge that the people almost created themselves too and i think that people got into such a [ __ ] race to just produce [ __ ] that you know the market had to even out for a minute you know like and really saturated and they shot themselves a little bit and you know there were people that created quality product but when was the last time you really wanted to buy sour space candy you know like when was the last time you wanted to buy lifter and then that creates almost a dishonesty in the marketplace because you know then you have a market that felt like they had to you know like get rid of their crop and they were renaming [ __ ] [ __ ] that was you know like and that's cool it is what it is i guess but you know like i just think that like it's it's where it is and it's in a good place now because you know people like you know sour waves that call people out on their prices and you know people that you know like like don't you know let people get cheaped out in the industry you have let people like work harder and put more quality into [ __ ] so really at the end of the prices that's it if anything sour prove that memes memes dictate the prices and uh if you get if you get called out on some [ __ ] it's all about how you reply and fix it not how you [ __ ] clap back so remember that people out there listening so hey man the new craze thing right now everybody you know they in our area they would have turned their nose and their thumb up to like some cbd sold at the gas station or some smokeable flower but dude in texas it's a it's a viable method of getting what you need when you need it and like there is nothing wrong with that but let's take a little bit deeper dive into that because we all know that you know the smokeable cbd flowers out there but what's with this delta [ __ ] eight man um it's pretty great um like i on uh you know um i'm not the child's parent but i don't mind being the honest voice that reports it you know i mean this [ __ ] really again i'm not a doctor i'm not a scientist but i if you know like the universe can strike me down and take everything away from me if there aren't people that have haven't like brought their kids in here and now bring them often you know that the shit's helped them help them get off medications and [ __ ] you know like it can be a fad for everybody else but you know for me like again like i treated it like i treat you know like i mean anything else you know like that's important i mean don't you know like if you're if i mean you have to start with at least giving it the best opportunity for being the most legit source to evaluate your decision on whether it's going to work or not you know like and so we start with a high potency material and um like it's pretty [ __ ] awesome and the same things that you know people achieve with standard delta 9 thc like we [ __ ] around and achieved the same actual effects without having to [ __ ] people with delta a and you know it's uh if that's legal and that's what we can do and we can do a lot of it and you know not catch any more cases and [ __ ] like that you know like and everybody wins people get to heal you have an awesome product you get to bring to the market and hell maybe even people might learn something at the end of the day off the [ __ ] too so just to dive a little bit deeper into delta eight i mean this is this is basically the same chemical that people would associate with um the same compound that people would associate with cannabis uh thc but it is cbd and it's derived from him um it's not cbd but it is him derived it's kind of like the opposite of cbd like there's a zero percent cbd but yeah it's a cannabinoid and it's definitely him derived for sure yes yeah and then you know this is and i'll be the first one to say i'm not a scientist i'm more like the guy that wants to learn about the growing side of things sure we all want to learn yeah we're all figuring out and when i hear about something delta nine that's not you know when i hear about delta 8 it's not thc but it can get you kind of high how do you describe that high because my first you know thing that i think is people told me cbd don't get me high but i remember how good cbd made me feel and [ __ ] that means i'm that means i'm high right so how does delta 8 differ to this feeling you get from a um you know regular marijuana high um i'm just gonna use the purest version of the of the word high because how you said like some people feel like lifting weights gets you high you know you can technically get hydrophilia from you know like drinking too much water and get some weird [ __ ] feeling and i guess you would qualify that as a high but i mean to put the [ __ ] aside to get you high the difference is you know like it's um you know like we tweak it to where we can play with it you know what i mean like um you know like we make products that we enhance with terpenes so in that sense you we can push the way the high feels you know so in that sense it brings that essence back but if you just talk about the raw delta eight experience um it's actually you know like and i'm and i i feel weird saying that it's like better but like i'm already high [ __ ] strong as it is you know like i like i don't need all the extra anxiety sometimes but i love weed let me say that first and foremost it's just sometimes i can deal without all the extra [ __ ] you know what i mean like sometimes i just want to chill and not have some extra thoughts you know like and and the wrong thing can make your mind go a different way it's a medicine it's a it's a it's an active thing so you know as it is by itself it's great because it's just super chill um you know like i think that i did not even smoke my first real joint of real weed until about two hours ago and you know like if you if you've ever met me in the last 30 years if i wasn't on probation i've been high you know like so but you know to me like i didn't need to necessarily you know like stop what i was doing to do anything else i've been hitting our own vapes and they're great you know we have og kush we have all these different things and you know i can i can make myself feel how i want to feel by using different terpenes and stuff like that so well let me ask you this because the smoking is one way and you know you can control the way you feel how the hell does the delta eight work with edibles is there anything uh more different with it could you really just not over oh you know how i don't want to put that word on how do i say it can you really not overdo it i don't want to say that [ __ ] no i mean um because that's i would never ever tell someone that um just to begin with because you know like that's like you know say what you want to about masks and [ __ ] like that but the minute they said that it's just okay to not wear a mask right now everybody [ __ ] forgot that we have corona so you're gonna get what you're looking for you know what i mean like you know but all [ __ ] aside no i mean i ate three three of our 50 milligram edibles one night because they were just [ __ ] delicious and i mean i had to check myself and i'm a big guy i mean my legs were like spaghetti and i just i forgot i ate some chicken wings i mean it was pretty strong to me and you know but but i think that people are figuring out that um it's kind of like again you know i don't want to i just don't want to answer that question the wrong way because i also have people that you know like um the homeboy jeff who publicly is one of our customers and friends now he buys a whole bottle and goes through a whole bottle of this pure ass you know sublingual stuff per week man if i did that i would not be i'd be ready yeah you know i mean so it's kind of myself on a good level yeah it's kind of a little different but uh it's uh as far as eating it you're yeah i mean you get that same different intensity it's it's really very very much [ __ ] similar to delta nine you're not missing anything i feel like i'm not missing anything i mean i love it i love all great strains of weed and you know like when it's legal we'll be able to get there but for now you can feel absolutely [ __ ] great and taste some delicious [ __ ] you know and it doesn't have as hard of a punch for some people which i mean yeah and if you need a little extra punch i mean so do consume a little bit more you know enjoy a little bit more so i mean so it's safe to assume that we will see dabbable forms of consumption for um delta eight we will see edible forms of consumption what do you mean what do you mean we will see it i gotta we got shields we've got slabs of it here yeah i wish i had one in front of me but oh yeah like we've yeah i've got a whole brick of it that just came in a little while ago oh for sure it's great it's fantastic and so this is the future right now you know we're seeing a lot of more people get into this and a lot i mean it's it's really essentially a loophole that allows this to go through but you know we we see the bureaucracy and we see the red tape come and go do you foresee them closing this loophole in the next two years or is this going to be an ab you know an actual outlet for people to go look at this is a whole big ass slab um i'll cut it open next time and i'll post some pics and i'll tag you in it but yeah oh it's amazingly great and you know like again you can get your giddies off of it or you can use the same ingredients and make you know [ __ ] that you know helps kids not be on a lot of like organ destroying medications you know like i mean it's viable [ __ ] um i'm sorry i don't mean to talk over you i think you're asking do i think about do that do i think they'll focus on us and take it away eventually all good things get [ __ ] over right they've got a way of [ __ ] hating on us and everything we like they want to say is wrong so are they going to do that to this too um i think that i think that it's been inspiring especially like with a smokeable flower thing that just happened for example and you know what there's some really good people and thank god there's some really good people that do have [ __ ] money and they do have power because sometimes i guess that's what it takes i mean it takes a lot of good regular people and a good vest but you know thank god for the people that have those monies for those lawyers that are out there able to fight and you know they're putting stalls in the courts you know even as recently for the cbd flower and [ __ ] like that in texas you know they tried to take that [ __ ] i mean i i mean if they if it's if it's a [ __ ] ill you know like illogical as as intentionally as miniscule as you know the [ __ ] loophole is i mean i hate to say the word loophole but [ __ ] it we gotta use words if you skip the loophole and it's benefiting people i mean then [ __ ] them and i don't know maybe i mean but then you know i don't know i mean everything's possible but i've you know it depends on who who you ask you know yeah it's going to be it's going to be a tricky i think it's going to be a tricky landscape to navigate going forward and i think you know just like we saw the regulations come with a 2018 farming bill and every state has gone legal since then i think we'll continue to see hurdles but if you know somebody was getting their own product off the ground and other than make sure you call [ __ ] oil well cbd to get them to help you out um you know what kind of recommendations do you give to people trying to launch their brand right now um simply put give a [ __ ] you know like you know i mean if you i when i started i just knew that the you know like it was getting expensive for lawyers and um you know like it was getting to be um you know a lot to not have to turn your friends in anymore and [ __ ] you know so i mean i felt like i was like what's the bare minimum i gotta do to see if this thing works and that i feel like was find myself 30 40 customers but provide them a unique thing that i at least really stood behind you know i don't do anything else i don't have a side job and i'm not saying that you have to quit your side job or fully commit but you know again if you know like talk about something else other than the 20 billion [ __ ] bubble that you know people use when they talk about why they want to be in the cannabis industry and tell someone just made you feel better if it did you know or at least be interested in why it may make someone else feel better and talk about that [ __ ] you know and then because this is a living culture and [ __ ] like you do it for the money it ain't gonna [ __ ] reward you you gotta do it for the [ __ ] culture i don't think people i think people will smell it out so like i said you just gotta find your real you know even when we take on brands with companies like one of our first questions when we profile them is we ask them like what is your why like why are you doing this like you know like and it can absolutely be you know tell us if it's for the [ __ ] money and that [ __ ] sucks but you know if it's something more interesting and you know useful than that you know tell us why and you know that's hugely important and i think that you know you have to identify yours your wife or yourself and then once you've done that like mine was my dog i didn't know what cbd was i didn't know what this [ __ ] was but you know if it was if it was up to veterinarians and people that you know like when my dog got sick like literally six years ago i would have put my dog to sleep and he's still alive and he walks [ __ ] funny and [ __ ] and he's deaf and [ __ ] you know like he's kind of a dumb ass but he's still alive and he's my dog and he's still absolutely healthy and it's about making a way out of no way there you know yeah you got to find your why and make that way out of nowhere yeah so um man super insightful i mean i i i already feel like uh i need to i need to start my brand you know what's the process the one what's the process one could go through to reach out to oil well cbd and you know get under the umbrella um appreciate it um you know just check us out if anything you know we try not to fill the internet with [ __ ] or propaganda i mean if you see

winners we'll get you hooked up so saint st patrick's day it's only it's almost six and we're already faded hell yeah that's how you do it it's a good wednesday yeah it's before the before the happy hour even started at least came in there was the the food that dutch uh provided he had some good irish food you know he had uh it's brisket it's called brisket irish food and people are just the way he made it right this is some meat and potatoes and some guinness what corn beef hash is that was called yep that corned beef yeah it's not corned beef hash but yeah that's not more of an eggplant it was more of a texas dude there's some hash plants well it was delicious yeah see what our my recipe my [ __ ] irish recipe of the week is the [ __ ] irish stew with the guinness so you you know use the guinness is like the beef broth in your stew oh my god and then you medicate that [ __ ] and just man you don't even wake up the next day for your hangover damn but um you know we like to start a a new segment this week this one's uh this one's a it's close to my heart all right i come from an era where it wasn't cool to like comic books you know and growing up in high school you know it wasn't okay to just be hanging out talking about you know captain america or miss marvel or [ __ ] teenage mutant ninja turtles and uh you know i'm a nerd by heart but i also love cannabis so this next segment we're bringing out is called comics and cannabis and uh you know big thank you to s upstate grower for another great tune another jingle he murdered [Music] graphic novels with tons of depth get the most out of your life absolutely here comes the hydro shell on each wednesday night when the timing is right oh yeah just to get blazing her while talking nerd [ __ ] classic stories with mass appeal medicating with his cheese we light up here comes the hydrochem what do you think saint did he murder it that was awesome he murdered it every time so this this segment of comic books and cannabis man we got two things going on the end of one division just happened last week everybody's all nerding out over that but they really really [ __ ] [ __ ] the bet on that one they got to get these [ __ ] actors under control because paul bettany the whole time is like talking about some luke skywalk walker s cameo from some marvel cinematic universe character and they never showed up it was just paul bettany dressed as white vision what a [ __ ] letdown saying you didn't watch did you no i wasn't asking is that show even any good it seemed kind of weird to me when i seen it i was like is this the actual part of the movie series or is it the whole spin-off it's just basically four beginning episodes of just like nostalgia con old school 90s [ __ ] with a bunch of easter eggs in it and then like the story develops and it kind of goes nowhere but then it comes back and there's a bunch of new characters that you know they'll use movies for they'll be using the movies later but they're going nowhere now so i mean how pissed are you if you were an actor and you only wanted to be in the mcu and you finally get in and they just crashed you was just some character in a tv show that kind of goes nowhere with your origin story but they're good at [ __ ] cleaning up the messes but i just feel like they got to put something some kind of [ __ ] do not say [ __ ] on these actors because they go to the interview they go to the [ __ ] the the magazine and they talk about how some shit's gonna happen and they don't happen and it's kind of a letdown when the show probably if it didn't have [ __ ] like that hanging over it like the the culmination of the entire series comes down to this one [ __ ] cameo then i'd probably be looking at in a different retrospect but i got sucked into that whole [ __ ] thing paul bettany you [ __ ] got me dammit vision rip that [ __ ] jewel out of your forehead thanos style and then let's go over to the dc universe all right saint you ready to go with the dc universe yeah to new to new earth do you know what that is no lars no new earth yeah no new earth is is what they refer to as the dc universe it's not in the ultimate the dimension but you know whatever and earth in is 393913 if you were wondering what he's not but let's you know in dc [ __ ] the snyder cut comes out tomorrow guys they're re-releasing a movie and everyone knows me i'm no no no this is not a great thing saying rewind so like for me i always [ __ ] uh in the marvel die hard guy i always make fun of the dc guys dc is okay but marvel [ __ ] rules the nest all right but this [ __ ] movie was trying so hard to keep up with avengers and they came out and then you know poor zack snyder he did lose his daughter and then he couldn't you know finish directing the movie so joss whedon had to take over who was the guy who directed the avengers and he [ __ ] can the whole dc movie he just made sure it would never [ __ ] it would never compare to the avengers right which is like the best movie of all time in my opinion so they [ __ ] they totally [ __ ] zack snyder's vision he's depressed he lost his you know daughter and it's you know pretty sad situation but then they they [ __ ] find out that there's a snyder cut out there of this movie and it's unfinished and it was like his vision so what do they do they [ __ ] let snyder redirect his movie they bring back all the actors reshoot scenes over four hours of [ __ ] movie now instead of a two-hour movie it's a four-hour movie and i'm just scared saint that it's just gonna be the same [ __ ] movie but just four hours longer and four hours shittier dude and it's like is it stretched oh i mean how hard could you stretch a [ __ ] movie and think ben affleck was going through his alcoholism at the time right so he left the movie he [ __ ] came back he's like i mean you can see he was an alcoholic now he's not an alcoholic you can see it in the eyes i personally want my batman with troubled baggage like i'm talking eyes like he hasn't slept in weeks for sure a [ __ ] four day binger of just killing people and drinking and [ __ ] throwing people off buildings and moping over catwoman and [ __ ] like that's what i want but no we got sober ben affleck batfleck batflick is sober i don't know so i'm just that's my that's my and then wonder woman she don't have her confidence anymore both are [ __ ] movies flopped you can see it in her eyes too dc's i don't know dc is going nowhere that's just my [ __ ] opinion and uh that's that's my that's my week in comic books and cannabis they cancelled comic con so man you guys are going to be forced to deal with my nerdy [ __ ] for the next foreseeable future i'm making this permanent this is permanent now like rick and like rick and morty karmic books and cannabis for the next three seasons yeah comic books and cannabis forever saint that's our arc that's our entire arc saying that's what we're going to do now it's just can't miss and comic books just forever superman and dc and marvel man ah so that's good we got a floor series box to give away we uh the heavy tee grow shows coming up here in about 10 minutes um we got a big interview lined up with gavita and mike anderson's going to be dropping some knowledge so sit back we're gonna get up in your e-hole this is [ __ ] dfz radio farm-to-table cannabis checking out [Music] [Music] high", "grbaHd86-6E": "[Music] [Music] ah ah [Applause] [Music] you", "OgmH0nRS7ug": "I don't think I can surpass Frank's last talked it was absolutely marvelous for those who were here and I think Oregon right to life will be able to get copies of his talk for you you can ask gail or call the office i always give a handout and i made a hundred so if you don't have a handout i would suggest that you call oregon right to life ask for Jane and she can mail a copy to you because I made I made a hundred of them I learned that a long time ago in medical school and that's why my handwriting is terrible today I could never keep up with the writing on the blackboard by the professors who would cystic earth in a sadistic way say you can't keep up with me and so I think you can sit back relax the main things that I'm going to talk about or on these slides but I gave you a book this year it's 27 pages and there's no way I can cover 27 pages in 45 to 47 minutes so there's a lot more information in your handout because I list from November through this past month all the attacks of over a hundred or so just these last four months on religious liberty and your conscience it's everywhere it's it's exponentially increasing each month so please use your hand out and if you don't have one you can contact jane or oregon right to life I like to begin with the prayer / that special for me and to start this conference because it's really the program this year is the hope of the child and the child if you listen to the lead speaker this morning I doesn't see much hope if you're inside the womb so we like to say a prayer today we pray for all of God's children especially those who are aborted abused or abandoned we pray for a society that no long that not not only tolerates that violence but modestep violence we pray for the men and women who they do not know they are doing that violence and we particularly pray that God's mercy and grace and love transform those people to forgive themselves their victims and to say I'm sorry to their Creator God Almighty amen alright I don't know how you felt after the november seventh with six was the election but took me a day to recover but not only the statue of liberty was weeping i thought it was an end to my life and I've talked to a lot of people about my age and they felt similarly that something happened a darkness was there that prevailed that could not ever be obtained again I there so I felt very dark and if you look at that picture and that shadow to the right I felt that something dark Satan man whomever you want vampires there is a certain darkness over our country our country I thought depending on the result of that election would either regain some of its religion Ossett II its objective values or it would lose those values forever we have a president who has decided on kingship or dictatorship rather than a democracy and the attacks on the First Amendment even though we've heard many many attacks and on both sides for the Second Amendment gun gun control our First Amendment our ability to say what we believe in public without being called terrible names or threatened or criminalized or in jail in prison is under attack we have not only the threat of the inside as Marvis Lee presented to you this morning by our first speaker Lila about abortion and the bravery of those for pro-life people standing in front of a kneeling in front of a raucous crowd to say that we do believe in life they remind me that picture of the early Christians in the Coliseum waiting for the Lions to come out on the other side Robert Spencer is probably the foremost author on radical Islam he has a website and I recommend it you will be depressed if you do he's written a new book about the effect of radical Islam and if the Boston Marathon didn't raise our awareness that there are some Muslims out there that think of only one thing hate and revenge or a moment of glory than you need to read his book Frank mentioned and I think Lila also mentioned about what's going on in our schools it's pathetic it is absolutely pathetic and I spent the last two years talking to you about communism and the takeover of communism or socialism or radical secular humanism they're all kind of connected in our schools and that the primary problem we have in our school is what they're being indoctrinating into the child minds of our children hooked is a lovely book by a doctor who dr. Mack eleni who has said not only do you have to worry about venereal disease and unwanted pregnancy it has a permanent effect just like drugs on the brains of our children who are being hit with over explicit age-inappropriate sex ed beginning in the kindergarten it will have an effect on their brains which will be permanent as they go through life good book to read Makka lainey dr. McIlhenny haha alright hold on for a sec it's joseph and it's MC kappa IL hae n ey he's a doctor of medicine and the other book is not one is this this whole program today is about the child and as we look for gay marriage as you look for all the attacks single motherhood single parenthood who is watching over the children that is the thing as we look at radical sex explicit sex ed has any of these so-called elitist or socialist or thinkers thought about what effect is having on our children that will be permanently affected sorry we talked about and we abuse the word equality mr. Ted Olson who was conservative and try to get to Bush past the hanging chads with the election in two thousand has now turned into saying that it's an equality issue gay marriage and same-sex attract it's an equality issue and therefore we have to think that everybody should have equal rights no matter what orientation a wonderful book by an hander shot I recommended as the poly politics of deviance it's a good read and if you want to be and I I guess the thing I would reiterate that Frank said is that we all need to be educated we're dumb down even those who keep up we all need to be educated by reading appropriate material I call the slide the children of men not God because man now is said we don't need God God has been kicked out of our school rules it has been minimized even in religious institutions certainly in our society we're catered we're not cater to we are patronized saying well you know Hillary Clinton and our president as both said listen we're not taking away your religious worship you're free to worship any way you want just keep it inside the four walls of your church do not bring it to the public square so this book is you know we've talked about Democrat demographic winterization of Europe it will be Muslim nized within probably the next 20 years Italy will be primarily the Vatican will be surrounded by Islamic state because no one is reproducing fifty percent of Italian women don't get married and fifty percent of Italian women don't have any babies so the replacement rate is now 1.2 and it needs to point to your 2.12 we just keep it even then we have again these wonderful elitist scientists social thinkers who say why have children the ethical debate so what are we done to the concept of that beautiful picture of a newborn baby or the excitement of a mother and father when they see their first picture of their baby and an ultrasound what have we done to that then we have some more radical thinkers Hanna rosin is written article in the Atlantic magazine and she said the end of men and she's basically saying two women in college who want to be CEOs and directors of multi national organizations go out and have relations as much as you want but do not get attached because if you get attached then that's going to that's going to be that big bump in your road that will frustrate you from becoming the woman that you were meant to be which is controlling 500 million men in your organization another so-called socialist scientist from Britain said the new rules what are the new rule and she equates having sex outside marriage like having a pizza elsewhere that most of us have dinner at home but we do go out occasionally and eat at wherever and why can't sex be the same way with no certainly no guilt involved and that will make everybody happy these are teaching at cambridge university and hannah has written in atlantic as i said and she is the new betty friedman freedom who said in nineteen sixty who started the feminine mystique for those old enough to remember women need a man like a fish needs a bicycle and that was her cry and women take your apron off get out of that darn kitchen and be equal to your man he's got to do the dishes from now on and everything else so we have a de feminin of women and adi masculinization of men it gets worse you look at the college campuses what are our kids being taught this man wrote a book about sex at yale now if you remember again going way back William Buckley wrote a beautiful book on God men and Yale and what he said wrote that 50 some years ago he was saying what happened to the godlike principles that Yale was founded on where is God well God's gone and now sex is sex has replaced him so now is no longer God and men at Yale it's sex and he goes through and this is a very this is for the strong stomach people among you if you are timid do not read this book it will show you the indoctrination of freshmen Lyla mentioned a little bit to it starting out with not only free contraception but they have one week there where everything goes at Yale same thing happening in delaware and colombia colombian yale are trying to vie for number one on perversion and that's a course that they don't sell papers to but it is there ever bit and then we had last year we had that one speaker talking about that one blind brave Chinese man who was fighting by himself against the Chinese government of one child policy but the one thing that we forget is that you know sex trafficking is a huge sequel a sequel of what happens when we have such sexual human trafficking the Obama said to recently to the US Catholic Bishops Association last year we can't fund you anymore you're giving money to help these poor women and men who are being taken there usually out from poor countries but also right here in the United States and they're having money used in grant money to take care of these women but because the Catholic Church does not believe an abortion or oh my god contraception those funds were eliminated by the Obama administration this year two trials going on one happened in 1946 and doctor called Brandt who was Hitler's personal physician and the head of his t4 program I always liked government words they always use words they're so oblique that you're saying what doesn't sound too bad t4 and it's an address in in Berlin and from there they murdered 275 Germans who were not up to snuff they were Down syndrome defected World War One vets who were wounded and so they started that out even before World War two and dr. Karl branta was the mastermind of that he was hung two years later after his trial in nuremberg in 1948 i would hope we would have enough courage to hang this man who has done as much harm maybe not 275,000 but he has murdered women he has murdered infants and for CB ABC CBS CNN and all the major ones this trials gone on for five weeks and only this past week because of people using social media has embarrassed them to cover the atrocities of what's going on and who turned him in his co-workers and if you read the testimony as Anderson Cooper did he I think he said my god this is what I'm pro-choice I'm pro reproductive rights but this this sounds really bad streams being heard and bloody babies and the snapping of necks after birth of live infants the filth and his own colleagues that he trained a high Sun on high school graduate non high school graduate to do as anesthesia and they wonder why the lady died from overdose of anesthesia so two days before last year's election the nun CEO the spokesman from the Vatican came and talked at Notre Dame and said the persecutions of Christians is a reality even in America and if you don't believe it it's time to wake up I've been saying this now for five years it can present itself in many forms but the first one is we don't want you at the party do your worship keep your religion personalized but don't dare to speak your views at the pile of public square or on social media because you will be persecuted we hear a lot about tolerance and equality and these are words that have been flip-flopped just like a 1984 aldous huxley words mean things and all social engineering begins before the actual or all social engineering begins with verbal engineering we don't know what words mean anymore and so the traditional view of Tolerance was to be egalitarian or equal to someone who has a different view you're going to still respect them he may say black is greater than white and you say white is greater than black but you respect each other you can have a dialogue that's the second mammut right love thy neighbor you may think his ideas are wacko but that doesn't mean you think he's wacko and you treat him with respect that was the traditional definition of tolerance tolerance apply to how we treat people with dignity no matter if we have different color of skin or different religious belief or different ideas but ideas we treat we don't say your false ideas in my opinion are equal they are not that's illogical unfortunately we have flip this around and the gay media and the gay activists have particularly uses Muslim radical Muslim pro-abortion all these tentacles of evil coming in have used it by flipping it saying all ideas are equal but it's you bigots that say you know that the Bible is hate speech so they flipped it completely around and so if you reject my ideas no matter what it is Yuri disrespect me just by saying I love you I'm worried about your eternal soul I want to make sure your soul gets to heaven if you're a Christian and your activity that you're doing right now may not make it you know make it possible for you so I out of love as a Christian I say think about what you're doing no no you can't do that because you hate me you disrespect me you're a bigot and you need to be intolerant and you need to be silenced Anthony etholon is a great writer it's got a great book up right now that's a great read but Aristotle a long time ago he was quoted this morning the first session said define justice as giving each his due okay each is due his definition however admits of equality and inequality and he uses as this metaphor this big 300-pound sumi wrestler against a child right David and Goliath they're not equal in strength size or whatever and so by definition we give that infant or the unborn child his do the protection Bettis do the unalienable right that is due but we may say that we give another protection to that sumo wrestler who's having trouble with his diabetes you cannot you cannot compare each person is equally deserving of his do this is the Christian message but enforcing equality you must have it we must have and now not only with gay marriage we have now polyamory Hillary Clinton is said that she's for the big three now as she begins her run in four years I'm for adultery I'm for polygamy and I'm for polyamory that means more than two okay and then you've got a group of Germans all in Germany so Felix bestiality who are complaining say we don't harm animals we love animals and why can't we love them completely once you change a definition once you change the words then it all comes tumbling down Humpty Dumpty said that many years ago and for that you can't see in the back when I use the word Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone to Alice it means just what I choose it to me neither more nor less but Alice asked whether you can make words mean so many different things and he says the question is which is to be master that's all he who masters words as we saw that from Frank is so what Hitler said you can put right there on Obama script right now persons are different the words and the message are the same and evil is the same so bigotry and the abusive language people who oppose gay marriage are being treated like homophobes bigots intolerant by those who call for tolerance think of it I mean they're screaming and it's you then ya think of the letter to Timothy about st. Paul's litter you know we can't see the two by four inner eye but we can see the splinter and somebody else of the same defect so those are yelling for tolerance and equality and understanding and compassion are the least intolerant compassionate people on earth at this point bigot is now used not to convey a meaning but as a kind of a verbal slap in your face it stops conversation and discussion and a rational manner bad rhetoric makes bad men Ralph Emerson said and every idle word Matthew said in his gospel every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account on the day of judgment and I really really love this man he was a former president of Secretary General of the United Nation he died in a plane crash to misuse words is to show contempt for men we're no longer civil anymore look at the pickup truck that never stops at the side stop sign and comes right in we're flipping each other off on small things just driving etiquette they're your know the f-word has become dialogue and debates on TV and in the home and in the school so to misuse those words is to show contempt for man and it causes man to regress down the long path of evolution so the five stages can you just give me when I have five minutes left a high sign because i tend to could be here three hours the five stages of persecution now the first three have been around since Cain and Abel stereotyping vilifying and marginalizing it so only the last five to six years that if you are bigoted quotes by a group called a bigot you can be criminalized you can be in prison you can be fined you can be not only a beating behind the woodshed you can be physically persecuted which is the last stage and right now there was a wonderful article in January by a Monsignor who said we are now between the fourth and the fifth stages we're now going between criminalization now to physical persecution so as I mentioned the first three been around but they certainly increase since the 60s and most of more ad hominem now you'll hear a lot of people on TV use ad hominem arguments Bob Beckel is classic and O'Reilly and triumph drives me nuts because he said last night that the father of these two assassins was alone how does he know that that's that's an ad hominem argument he's calling name-calling so Christians have been called for Cain and Abel bible thumpers haver drew haters of science hypocrites are characters in posing we're imposing our morality self-righteous hate-filled narrow-minded and you could write a whole book on all that once again the nun CEO from the vatican martyrdom doesn't necessarily mean physical torture and death however the objective are those who desire to harm the faith may choose a path of making you so feeling ridiculous that they silent you and that is a wonderful powerful tool to silence you and felt marginalized where are we today just some examples very brief and I've got six pages on those 27 pages I can't go through them all so I'm going to give you some highlights HHS mandate starting in august of this year so far it's hit and miss on the judges the judges says you haven't been hurt enough so therefore we're going to say that you don't have a stand but it's coming and you will be fined or imprisoned and we'll find out come August Catholic adoption agencies because they were discredited because they did not refer to homosexual couples have been essentially been shut down the last adoption agency in the UK was shut down this past year and you know how many years they've been doing this in the Catholic Church in this country outstanding service for finding homes for children and having wonderful well-kept well clean well-educated orphanages free speech I'll talk to you a little bit more about it but in March of just the north of us in Canada free speech now has been attacked in a landmark case and this man I don't know what his credibility is he's a representative from California but he said this reparative therapy if you have a confused teenager male or female who says I I don't know I've got am I am I homosexual I'm a lesbian I really don't know I I'm teased about it I'm not worried well liked I'm confused I need help he cannot get help anymore in California it is now a crime for a psychiatrist psychologist a counselor to tell this confused kid its class you know why we just sit down and talk about it there is a thing called reparative therapy it's not a hundred percent it started by in part by the priests to forgot his name he started courage I and it's been done in holland by the best book on homosexual re parative therapy is by a Dutch psychologist who's been doing this for 30 years and he has about a twenty-five thirty percent chance of success if they have a strong faith if they want to change they can change and yes there has been suicides and this is why this representative said one or two teenagers got so confused the help didn't help it made it worse and they kill themselves there for a politician now changes an aspect of medicine that was helping these confusions and why are they confused because the explicit sex ed programs starting in the sixth grade that everything goes including your pet dog in Brazil they have so much AIDS along the homosexual population they're dying off like flies they decided this United Nation agency and I've talked about the United Nations before they are primarily not themselves evil but there are a lot a lot of evil going on at the United Nations by people with an agenda and so they want to criminalize homophobia whatever that means because of the high incidence of AIDS and gay men that they're getting persecuted so they want to see criminalize the next step activists in the southern poverty law center splc down south has now officially said to the Obama White House we want to recognize the Catholic Church as a hate group that's okay in Italy 200 homosexual activists was surrounded this Archbishop's house at his home that's the same thing Archbishop house at his home and chanted slurs and everything else threatened verbally that we want to attack you why this is this person here is a bigot and he's not to be trusted because he wears a white collar here's what he said this is what upset them the purpose of homosexual right activists is to undermine what is the cornerstone of civilization a marriage between man and woman and the concept of family founded on marriage equating to other forms of cohabitation he realizes that anyone who tells the guts to even mention this now the first amendment to mention this will be persecuted either at home physically or this happened this is the first evidence of physical violence the united states that happened last year at the Family Research Center where this activist LBGT was working and he said I'm going to go down to those no-good bigots down there at Family Research Center and I'm going to bring a reason for evo over I'm going to kill him and he was stopped by an unarmed guard thank God who was shot in his arm doing fine but this is to my knowledge the first physical evidence of the stages of persecution I live in redmond but just a month ago we had three churches burned down in bed that's been going on for a long time I called that criminalization or personal for persecution now if you want to say you know I'm tired of the United States and all of its problems i'm going to move to iran i don't recommend that trip because this wonderful present ayatollah says the promotion of christianity must be stopped do you realize that there's an article out that since the year two thousand six million Iranians have converted to christianity how TV and bibles their little bible groups are starting now they know if they're caught they're going to be there in that hang position now those are prisoners but you know Iran doesn't have a long ACLU trials that go on for years and years they 500 executions in four months in one prison then I came across this wonderful man he was born a Romanian Jew and became an Anglican priest and these people voices of martyrs you want to join up any volunteers they go into countries that are being Christianity is being persecuted there are 71 countries in this globe right now they're Christian ities not wanted that's where they go that's where they go they're like the early Christians and the Colosseum to me and he mentioned this one brave woman's story tortures are men that never go to church never read the good book holy book or frequent the homes of believers their only chance of making it to heaven to be saved it have a Christian prisoner before them to speak to them about Christ with love even when being tortured and I would say whether you're Catholic Anglican Jewish Medical Pentecostal would have you we've lost that we've lost that we've never been persecuted physically and we need to regain that if we're going to win this fight I mentioned that landmark case here is a man putting out flyers on a corner in Canada saying here are the medical risk if your son or daughter are gay these are the medical risk they're going to lose 20 years off their life the average gay man takes 20 years off his life by that diagnosis if he stays to be an active gay the Canadian Supreme Court just a month ago said aha stop you're fine you do it again will imprison you because truthful statements can represent it in a manner that would meet the standard of eight speechless thing again truthful statements can meet our criteria that can be considered hate speech soul with the Catholic Church and Christian churches have said love the center aids in there saying no more no more that is not eat now it's those two are equal in the eyes of the supreme court therefore you are not welcome in the public square to tell the truth now this will come down as a landmark case unless it is reversed now obama won the women's vote the name and only catholic vote for though that I mean those that go to church on rarely the Latino vote the youth vote the low-information vote but it got sixty-eight percent of the pornographers and in April before the election he told Eric Holder listen let's lay low on persecuting of internet porn we'll give it to a lesser don't have the department of your department do it the local levels can do it better really Larry Flynt mock that Sarah Palin was a disservice to every woman in the United States because she dared to have a child who was born with Down syndrome this is the people he got there is it did you know that Eric Holder's wife as an OBGYN did you know that she has a part ownership of abortion clinic so does that make sense why eric holder who do you prosecute persecute and prosecute primarily was people standing out the little signs saying life is precious did you know that I'm telling you now this is my thought my wife and I teach religious education for entry into the Catholic Church for last five years and I'm saying are we looking at this whole discussion of abortion and euthanasia and all these in embryonic from the wrong way and I think we are that's my personal opinion their symptoms of a greater disease and the greater disease is ignorance of faith you can say ignorance of truth ignorance of faith it can become a spiritual malignancy that affects our heart our ability to love our ability to think or reason our mind and our conscience judging more relax we become more clueless a dumbing down of our faith faith is a gift from God but along with being a gift we have to respond to it James said that a long time ago and it's our responsibility to choose what what does our faith tell us everyone in this room to know love and serve God so we can be with them forever in total love for an eternity for an attorney do we believe that or is it a Santa Claus story and how do we defend our faith with one hour a week out of a hundred and sixty eight hours is that how we know our fate so I think in my lifetime I've seen myself included and dumb down until you have to say I need to be smarted up pious the tenth st. Pius the tenth died in 1914 he said this way back when a hundred years ago all the evil in the world is due to lukewarm Catholics you could say Christians lukewarmness is a disease our Lord said in the Gospel I will spit you out so I think the were one problem as I look at my personal belief is that we as Christians who do have a belief and we have all these social ills and things going on in our life that we have become lukewarm if we were red hot he never would have gotten a second term Swedish education now this is all post-election say and I'm Swedish so I can knock the sweets children may be taken to church for Advent last Advent nice sweet one percent of people go to church and Sweden on a regular basis but you can go to advent but you can't mention the name of Jesus gospel of Asia four hundred percent increase in assaults and Christians in India alone 71 nations persecute Christians and then Canadian hate crime law I love this anybody who says gender identity or sexual orientation girsl these are now considered groups to be protected by anti-hate UN groups and our president administration so basically you can get a snotty-nosed little lying deceptive teenage boy that says you know what it's Tuesday I feel feminine today I want to go in the girls potty room he doesn't need a no from a psychiatrist or a counselor he can choose to be a male on Tuesday and Thursday be a female and wednesday are very not only is in canada massachusetts our land of the free past this in march we call it the bathroom potty law with no documentation because now gender doesn't mean how you are made physically it's how you feel about it then the EU European Union proposal to ban children's books depicting traditional gender oh you cannot show a woman washing the dishes or the man mowing the lawn no gender I so sex and then the scientist well this past 200 years we sterilize those we didn't want to reproduce or kill them in the womb or out of the womb now we're going to do gene or genetic enhancement and if you don't have the bucs you're just going to be a drone you're not going to be on that spaceship two superb existence of increasing your intellect or your beauty and then we had just two weeks ago the poor Alabama elementary I have to say poor because her brain is not in her brain where it should be she said that they had Easter egg hunts but you can't use the word Easter it may offend and her superintendent I love them within 24 hours at a principal we don't mess with Christmas or Easter and so we're going to call it Easter egg hunt but this is how far our educational system if we allow this and we sit back and if we are none knowledgeable of the junk that's going on there they're mowing us down they are mowing us down Hannah's an Han and Han is out that Swedish words for boy and girl but hen is whatever 5th grade they're indoctrinating these kids and the sweetie school a Galia they don't mention sex at all differences everyone is now unisex or not sexy neutral neutral so the little dolls you don't see a boy doll or a girl doll they're neutral dolls designed to make sure that children don't fall into those gender stereotypes unisex but why what is their purpose I'll leave that up for you to deduce diversity day at in Maine women or children this was mid school showed graphic homosexual foreplay to demonstrate tolerance and the irate parents had a calm the waters at home and clean up the vomit their kids has seen this at the ages of 11 and 12 all for tolerance UK schools now at 13 you have an iud put in contraception parents nope no consent the Brits have gone nutso their most immoral country in Europe in my opinion the most immoral and they're saying well why is the premise ray keep going up and these keep giving it to you know preteens now but what are we doing wrong and then in Michigan they showed the Planned Parenthood I love them they can take what's right and make it left up down black white the miracle of abortion film is being shown the miracle of abortion to show boys and girls what a woman's body goes through when she undergoes an abortion sick all right I've got five minutes ok I'm on this basically this indoctrination of parents rights they're getting less in age by bringing up stuff that is inappropriate for the children basically inappropriate I don't think any eleven-year-old needs to know about oral or anal intercourse or the hundred and twenty five positions of sexual and relations I think that's overkill maybe I'm a bigot now I want to just mention these two two families because one case this this is a tragedy again in Sweden Swedish man is married to an east indian girl they have a child and they were homeschooling they did three sins they homeschooled he had a few carries in his mouth a few dental caries ah and he missed about one or two vaccinations so they're on a plane to go to India and he's pulled off literally pulled off the plane separated from his parents for two years their crimes I just mentioned look at his face on the left and the yellow t-shirt that's when he was happy look at his face now picture's worth a thousand words about a year ago this has been going on for three years about a year ago he was reunited with his family but a higher court overturned a lower court just two months ago and now he's been removed permanently from his family the mother collapsed she collapsed at the hearing so this is a Swedish gulag this is Family Education which will come here unless we stop now this family is going to be deported by Eric Holder and the Obama administration on the twenty-third of this month they've been here for three years they're crying homeschooling Germany Hitler nuts no homeschooling we want no other thoughts other than what we teach you in school so it's outlawed but no one did anything about it until they got some wacko in the head of Education and Germany who said we got to start prosecuting these people now that is a beautiful all-american all German family six children they've been living in Tennessee with political asylum for the last two or three years Eric Holder is said that homeschooling is not a human right and because not all homeschoolers believe when all Christians believe that she should have homeschool only therefore they're using the rules of the European Union and not our Constitution to decide that they have no right to have an asylum it's being decided on Tuesday of this coming week by the Sixth Circuit Court you can read about and I don't have time I'm going to end up because I'll be over right I've got what's going on with sex ed and what it does to the mind again please read those slides this doctor saying who studied AIDS and HIV for 25 years he said if you give depo provera which is the injectable birth control you double the rate and transmission of AIDS and the sub-saharan Africa and we got to billionaire saying we got a contraceptive world please read this about mark generis a wonderful sociologist at austin texas who came out with a definitive study last year saying that there is a difference between being raised by a man and a woman and two lesbians of two homosexuals he was vilified threatened death threats threatened with being fired they said his reefer research stunk and he had have an independent a professional organization come and review as literature and they said it's right on and yet this is what happens when you have the courage to speak the truth and you do objective science studies this is what you expect so I'm going to end up with these next four slides we look at baby Chloe found in a garbage can with inbuilt lahore detached this past month in texas and she was the most popular baby in texas so in all of us there is a goodness its god-given it's the natural law Laila's Edison are embedded in our hearts that's natural law that's a gift from God so when you look at that we're saying my gut she was tossed in a garbage can and I think they had something like over a thousand calls within 24 hours saying we'll take her will love her we'll adopt her so that is a hope we have one month mother in East India who says I have too many children so I have to strangle my daughter at birth because she happens to be a girl we have that 88 year old Saint over there who's now dying of renal failure who in her 80s adopted 30 babies in the trash cans in China with her one child her last adopt a baby she was 82 we have a difference we all have a choice in this room what we want to do he wasn't hope yet could that's a cardinal hat but here he is washing the feet of a young boy in a wheelchair who is dying of AIDS we all have that ability to love we were created by love for love to love and this beautiful picture painted by a wonderful Italian I'm going to leave this as the last slide Gail always says I have to give you hope after all decoration how he's going for a double right now this is a quiz post-election quiz in november two thousand twelve not written by me but somebody much smarter it's true or false ten questions it's in your notes you don't have to copy them as we look at this picture of Christ being mocked and look at the gentleness of his hands still reaching out to the mocker and the gnarled hatred in the hand of the person who's mocking we have ten questions true or false whoever won in November Jesus will still be king whoever won our responsibilities responsibilities that Christians will not have changed whoever won the greatest agent for social change to change the hearts and minds and men and women will be the gospel of life whoever won our primary citizenship will be in this order the kingdom of God first and America not vice versa whoever won the tomb will still be empty whoever won the cross not the government will be our salvation whoever won our children will be more concerned with whether we spend time with them rather than who is president whoever won my neighbor will still be my neighbor and loving him or her will still be the second greatest commandment whoever won Jesus is Lord who will be the greatest truth in the world and last whoever won we will know and believe that God is in control thank you you", "4kLDuKe71w4": "assalamo alaikum wa rahmatullah wa barakatu rubbish release of a westerly mb of data be listening
