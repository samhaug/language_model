{"HYMd4rhjF0A": "it's another beautiful day to watch another video and for me to be here with you right now I just want to talk about full-spectrum hemp oil what it is and what the difference is between it and regular CBD oil so full-spectrum refers to when the pure oil extracted from the hemp plant contains all the same cannabinoids and compounds found in the original plant cannabidiol is actually very very beneficial it makes up over 90% of the cannabinoid content in a plant it's non psychoactive and it's the main focus of the benefits of hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil contains cannabidiol as well as everything else that's included with it so in addition to all the other different cannabinoids in a hemp plant full-spectrum hemp oil also has a great variety of essential vitamins minerals omega fatty acids flavonoids chlorophyll and terpenes health benefits of a full spectrum hemp oil go beyond just the therapeutic benefits of CBD itself the array of cannabinoids and other natural constituents and compounds that are in the entire hemp oil like the whole oil work together in what's known as the entourage effect and together these compounds all work harmoniously to magnify their therapeutic properties this mix of cannabinoids essential nutrients proteins essential fatty acids they'll work together synergistically to encourage homeostasis and balance in our health full spectrum hemp oil comes in tinctures edibles they also have like lotions and capsules available you guys might want to know like does it show up in drug tests did hemp THC is a very minor constituent and only appears in under 0.3% by dry weight so this extremely low level of THC in hemp makes the hemp oil the full spectrum hemp oil non psychoactive and safe to use for all ages and today we're gonna be checking out this brand called Veritas Farms which is a farm-to-table full spectrum hemp oil company located in Colorado they also have capsules and gummies as you guys know I have been going through a lot of anxiety lately I do have CBD oil but I'm also you know trying out different brands just to see what's different and what I like and so far various farms has been really great transparency and sustainability is really important to them they use organic ingredients as much as possible they grow extract formulate bottle label and ship all from their farm locally they are third-party tested and they also emphasize so much that they're not a CBD company they're not a THC company they offer full spectrum hemp oil which offers the benefits of the entourage effect this one is strawberry flavored but they also have a salted caramel flavor that I was interested in trying out but I wanted to go simple first so I got strawberry I just placed dropper like straight under my tongue I like using the oil tincture for immediate effects for anxiety and stress the gummies and capsules would be the best for sleep because they set in a little bit later and one more item from various farms that I really really have been loving is this full-spectrum Fido cannabinoid rich lotion and we're talking about full spectrum but CBD for sure is really really good for inflammation stress also like joint pain I've been using this on my face lately my skin has been breaking out my like bumps on my chin have been going away had these little things go on they've gotten better this has been really really good for my skin anyway that's my little talk about CBD oil versus full spectrum hemp oil if you want to learn more about full spectrum hemp oil make sure you look in the description below but now I'm going to go I need to take some of this because it's time to go wake my grandma up so I can get her all ready for the day my parents out of town I'm her caregiver for the day which stresses me out a little bit because being a caregiver is very it's really stressful and also when it's somebody that you are related to can also be I don't know it's caused me a lot of anxiety lately so I've definitely been taking advantage of this full spectrum take some of this [Music] [Music] so I really wanted to go to yoga class today at the studio but my brother I guess wouldn't be home until later so no one could take care of my grandma and it kind of life are shaded me a little that I had these plans that was really excited about because it's by a teacher that I've been wanting to go to but that like it didn't fall through and I'm really really rigid with my schedule and I get really frustrated when things don't go my way because I'm like a control freak I especially like when it's things that I'm planning for and then I'm excited for and then it just like doesn't happen for some reason and it's harder for me to be flexible which is really interesting because this morning I was reading a little excerpt from this book called don't sweat the small stuff it just lies around the house they're just simple ways to keep the little things from taking over your life so before I knew that my brother would be coming late and I wouldn't be able to go to this yoga class that I was excited about I read this excerpt said that says be flexible changes in your plans like once we get something into our mind a plan it can be tricky to let go of it and just go with the flow and it's hard for me to go with the flow is it more important to stick to my original set my rigid schedule or to go with what I planned them to be available for my grandmother is missing that yoga class worth getting upset over just because plans didn't fall through the way that they were meant to be the more general question is what's more important getting what I want and keeping my plans or learning to go with the flow clearly to become a more peaceful person you must prioritize being flexible over rigidity most of the time it's also helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change if you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability then whatever happens you can say here's one of those inevitabilities in this little expert you said like you'll feel more relaxed yet you won't sacrifice any productivity you may even become more productive because you won't need to expend so much energy being upset and worried and I think that's a big thing it's like okay I need to just relax accept the fact that I missed a plan that I wanted to make today well rather than worrying about it and rather than be upset over it I could just make more plans and now I have space and room in my life in my head to just clear it out just relax and plan something better and do something else in that time I feel like this little rigidity that I have is what makes it hard for people around me to to like ask me for things or talk to me about things because I'm so rigid with my plan and I'm like me I don't want to change anything and that's what he says - it's like it'll make the people around you feel more peaceful and relaxed around you that they won't be walking on eggshells to ask about different things my mom definitely tiptoes around me because I'm just really rigid with my plans and I'm like very set in my ways and I get like upset over small things that change those plans so I don't know just a little a little tidbit instead of going to that yoga class I'm just going to do yoga outside in the Sun and enjoy it and also be present over here compromise being flexible me and although this might seem like a normal thing to most of you guys to me it's not and this is something that I personally struggle with and I hope I'm not alone on this but some of you might just be like what the heck Amanda it's just like a change in plans just go and do something else like it's not a big deal to most people but it's a big deal to me [Music]", "fXqFWTGU-_s": "This video is all about full spectrum CBD oil benefits What is full spectrum CBD oil and why is it better than regular CBD oil? Check it out. Hey guys My name is Johnny Ross. I am a student at the University of Kentucky right now And I just did some research on CBD so that you don't have to if anything in this video is helpful for you I would really appreciate it if you would stop by my subscription button over to onder and Smack it maybe leave a comment leave a like if you don't like it. Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant. It is actually very important to know what strain your CBD oil is coming from so You know what specific medicinal or therapeutic properties that you're getting in that oil because it's relevant to the genetics of the strain of cannabis That it came from that's what I got for you guys today except for one more thing Which is a link in the description to get some broad-spectrum CBD oil from a veteran-owned American company that sells CBD called pure American hemp oil Try them out first link in the description below and generally thank you guys so much for listening once again I appreciate your time.

Today, I'm reviewing the Populum Full-Spectrum\nHemp Oil. You've probably seen online a lot of videos,\na lot of articles about CBD oil. I want to talk a little bit about the science\nbehind that. I want to talk about the Populum here, my\nexperience with it, the benefits I felt, and some other things to consider. Let's get started. [music] Marten: I want to talk about the science behind\nCBD. First I want to say, if you want to see a\nlist of my top picks for CBD oil, Google Mattress Clarity best CBD oil. What exactly is CBD? It stands for Cannabidiol. It is a phytocannabinoid, a compound found\nin Cannabis sativa. One of the other phytocannabinoids which we're\ngoing to find in Cannabis sativa is THC. While THC is going to have some stony properties,\nit's going to give you that more of that high feeling, you're not going to get that feeling\nwith CBD taken from hemp plant. While THC is illegal in many states, CBD oil\ntaken from hemp plants is legal in all 50 states. Definitely keep that in mind. In terms of what exactly CBD can help you\nwith, while it's not going to give you that stony feeling, it can help with anxiety, nausea,\nand inflammation. Last but not least, it can help with sleep. As a person who deals with anxiety and that\nhas sleep issues, that's why I want to try out CBD oil. I want to know why you're interested in CBD\noil? Is it to help with your sleep, help with your\nanxiety, or for some other reason? Leave your answer in the comments section\nbelow. I want to see what everyone has to say. Now let's look at the Populum. Before I talk about the Populum, I do want\nto say I am not a doctor. If you're considering adding CBD to your medical\nregimen, or your sleep regimen, do talk to a medical professional. With the Populum here, you're going to have\nthree options -- 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams, and 1,000 milligrams. For the potency I went with a 500-milligram,\ntheir most popular potency. What exactly is in here? First off, you're going to have your CBD oil. This is a full-spectrum hemp oil. While some are going to be CBD isolates, some\nof those competitors are going to get only CBD oil, this is full spectrum. It's also going to have some other phytocannabinoids\nthat naturally occur in hemp plants. In here as well, you're going to have some\nphytocannabinoids such as CBG, which is also going to help with nausea and have anti-inflammatory\nproperties. In addition to that, you're going to have\nsome terpenes. Terpenes are essential oils found in the hemp\nplant, and those are going to have properties. They're going to help with the flavoring,\nalso give you some more sense of well-being. In here, you're also going to have hemp seed\noil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and cold-pressed orange oil. There's a lot in this bottle. These extra elements are going to help with\nflavoring, also going to have some amino acids, help with your metabolism and your immune\nsystem. There's a lot in here. If you want to know exactly what's in this\nmodel, don't worry. Every bottle is going to come with your lab\nresults. You're going to know exactly what is in this\nbatch of CBD oil. It's also a third-party tested. While it's not FDA approved, you know exactly\nit's in this bottle. It's tested for quality and effectiveness. How do you use the Populum? It's very, very simple. You first, unscrew the top here, and it's\ngoing to be a dropper. In terms of how much you want to fill it with,\nit does depend on how long you've used CBD oil for. If you're just getting started, Populum recommends\nusing 8 milligrams to 8.5 milligrams. This is the 500-milligram potency so it's\ngoing to be about a half a dropper. Once I have that, I put it under my tongue\nand then squirt the liquid under my tongue. I'll leave it in my mouth for 30 seconds. They also recommend you can work the liquid\non your cheeks with your tongue. After the 30 seconds, take two deep breaths. You can drink down the liquid and you're good\nto go. Let's talk about my experience with the Populum. I'm going to break that down into three sections\n-- falling asleep, staying asleep, and then the morning after. In terms of falling asleep, this worked very,\nvery well for me. I took it for a few weeks. Every night before bed when I'm watching TV,\nI would take this about 30 minutes before bed, and it definitely calmed me down. My anxiety was less and I deal with anxiety. Before bed sometimes it was hard for me to\nfall asleep. With the Populum, I definitely fell asleep\nmuch more quickly. In terms of staying asleep, I slept through\nthe night with no problem. However, that's not usually a big issue for\nme, staying asleep, so take that into account. But it did not negatively affect my sleep. The morning after, that's where I had some\nissues with the Populum. Waking up, I did feel a little bit groggy,\na little bit washy as I'm started out my day at work, out of it a little bit, having trouble\nfocusing. I will note this is my first time using CBD\noil. I lowered my dose over the next couple days. It did seem to work itself out. But keep that in mind, if you're just starting\nto use the CBD for yourself. Let's talk about some of the pros and some\nof the benefits I experienced using the Populum. First off, it made it easier to fall asleep. If you're looking for a CBD oil to help you\nfall asleep more quickly, definitely ease you down into a nice state of relaxation before\nyou sleep, take a look at the Populum. Also, if you want something to help you stay\nasleep all night, the Populum worked for me in that respect. If you want to sleep throughout the night,\nthe Populum could also work for you. I'm also a big fan the fact the Populum is\nfull spectrum. You're not just getting a CBD isolate, you're\nalso getting other phytocannabinoids. You get the full effect of the hemp plant\nwith this full-spectrum hemp oil. Lastly, speaking about the third-party testing,\nI like the fact they bring in outside scientists to come in and test this product to make sure\nyou get the best quality, the best effectiveness with the CBD oil. Let's talk about the cons. Some of the things you might want to consider\nif you're looking at the Populum. First off, I experience some morning grogginess\nthe next day. If you want someone's going to help you wake\nup clear-eyed and refreshed, the Populum might not be the best match for you. Keep this in mind. If you're looking for something with a lot\nof potency options there are only three with the Populum -- the 250, the 500, and the 1,000-milligram. Some other companies are going to have five\nor six options, so more options for you in terms of potency. Also, this CBD oil is not FDA approved. That's not necessarily a con for the Populum\nbecause most CBD oils are not FDA approved. But keep this in mind if you're going to add\nthis to your medical regimen. Lastly, in terms of price, right now it's\n$99 for a bottle for the 500 milligrams. That is very affordable for a CBD oil, but\nif you're comparing this to other sleep supplements, it might be on the pricier side. In the end, I enjoyed my experience with the\nPopulum. It helped me fall asleep more quickly, stay\nasleep, very much a nice experience overall. I will just note, if you're looking for something\nto have you waking up feeling more refreshed, you might want to look elsewhere. That's about it.

we're going to discuss the types of CBD products go over some basic guidelines cover a few specific product guidelines discuss the issues with perhaps taking too much and then wrap it up with some final thoughts and guide you to where you can maybe get some more information about CBD so I'm Blake Armstrong and that's a picture of my dog Rosie and I run the website cannabis supplements for pets so if you need any other type of information regarding CBD for pets you can head over to that informational website so let's talk about things to consider when treating your pet with CBD now before we look at all the specifics about CBD dosage for dogs and other pets it's important to cover just a few basics remember a lot of different factors can influence the exact dose of CBD your pet needs now I'll be discussing this in regards to dogs because that's where all my experience is however the same information applies to cats and other pets now one of the main factors influencing dosage with CBD products is the type of product you use now the supplement brand would also be something to consider so CBD products are typically available in three forms oils capsules and treats another major factor influencing dosage is your pet size now in general dosage for dogs varies once they weigh more than 20 pounds and lastly also remember that your dog's ailment can also affect how much CBD they should be taking so the dosage guidelines I aligned here are general and they can be adjusted to suit your pets needs so CBD dosage basics in general CBD oils are always administered in drops now the exact amount of drops needed for a dose can vary from one product to another but in general it consists of maybe two to four drops take in two to four times daily CBD capsules on the other hand usually contain between 150 and 200 milligrams of hemp extract each now again the exact number of capsules needed for a dose vary from one product to another but generally it consists of roughly one tablet taken one or two times per day now unlike oils and capsules CBD treats can contain varying concentrations of CBD and they should be given to your pet as per the package instructions so here's the bottom line with this whole subject matter whenever using any kind of CBD I recommend following the dosing instructions that came with the product seeing how your pet responds and adjusting the dose as needed here's some great news CBD has no known toxic level and is considered incapable of causing an overdose so just follow the product recommendations and the only real issue in giving too much is that you actually just waste the product so you don't want to be irresponsible and give too much to your pets but don't worry if you give them a little too much because you know it's not going to hurt them at the very least you're just going to waste some of the CBD products so just follow the instructions and you should be fine so here are some examples dosing example one this is from a product from Canepa their advanced max CBD liquid it comes in a ten milliliter container and which contains about 300 individual drops so here are the basics dosage guidelines for this particular product for small dogs they recommend a dog under 20 pounds you give them two to three drops three to four times daily now for larger dogs over 20 pounds they recommend with their particular product three to four drops three to four times daily so for dosage example number two here we'll look at a product from King canine they're another popular brand and their recommendations are slightly different and a little more specific so when you order CBD oil from King Kaena and you'll get a dosing chart and you also get a syringe and basically the chart has four columns the column on the left lists different weight categories and then the center columns are standard therapeutic and medicinal so you'll basically want to find the category in terms of weight that applies to your pet and then go along and choose whether you're going to give a standard therapeutic or medicinal dose and whether it's daily or you know situational so in examining those three center columns they're labeled standard therapeutic and medicinal standard is general immune support and situational so you know perhaps driving in the car or there's a bad strong thunderstorm outside so you want to just apply a standard dose therapeutic this refers to things such as anxiety nausea inflammation arthritis or maybe dealing with some pain or injury and then medicinal this refers to other situations where a larger dose is recommended so this could be things like cancer epilepsy or hip dysplasia so here are a few examples if you have a Terrier who weighs about 15 pounds that is suffering from anxiety due to traveling in a car or due to a loud thunderstorm a standard dose of 0.2 milliliters would be fine and you can find that dose on the chart given by King canine another example if you have an 80 pound German Shepherd suffering from hip dysplasia a daily dose of 3.2 milliliters would be appropriate so you can see here how the weight of your pet and the ailment that they're suffering from really determines the dosage now there might be some overlap between therapeutic and medicinal but just remember to monitor your pet and understand that CBD is a non psychoactive and non toxic substance that is considered incapable of causing an overdose do you want to follow the guidelines from the products but don't worry too much if you give a little too much or a little less just monitor your pet and they should be fine now if you need more specific information about CBD oils and products for pets you can certainly head over to cannabis supplements for pets calm and get some more detailed information and recommendations choosing the right product many pet owners struggle to decide which product to use for their pet now I generally recommend using CBD oil whenever possible when administered under the tongue CBD oil offers the fastest relief from symptoms capsules and treats on the other hand they need to pass through the digestive tract and can take at least 45 minutes to take effect however remember that oil treatment is the most difficult to administer and has the strongest taste if your dog is a bit picky and sensitive to strong tastes you may find better results using either capsules or treats you may also consider mixing the oil with food instead of directly applying it under your dog's tongue and directly in their mouth so here are some final thoughts on these dosage recommendations this video covered basic guidelines which may change depending on the size of your pet their condition and the type or brand of product that you use nonetheless remember that CBD is a non-toxic compound and cannot cause an overdose so for more information on CBD products for pets please subscribe to this channel and consider reading more of our guides on our official website so you can head over to cannabis supplements for pets calm and there you can find a ranking report on the top CBD oils for pets and we keep this updated when we're testing out new products

brands of CBD oil that I mentioned in this video and you can head over to the official website cannabis supplements for pets calm you can find links directly below this video as well where you can find more detailed information on tin canine and canna pet so I hope that you found this video useful and I truly hope that if you are giving your pet CBD that they start seeing some great results take care", "_qNbztygtRI": "[Music] what's up gentlemen today I want to talk about a hot topic something that you guys have been probably hearing a lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "Ju-M1VNL2ME": "a CVD for dogs and cats currently it's all the rage but here are the seven things that you should know before you start giving CBD to your dog or cat [Music] hello welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome I'm having an upcoming webinar called what you need to know about CBD for dogs and cats you can click the link in the box below for more information the CBD II it stands for cannabidiol it is the largest component of the hemp plant and it's the non psychoactive component before you start giving this to your pooch or your kitty cat there's a number of things you should be aware of first you know what's the source do you really know where those plants have come from you know is it a company that had actually growing their own plants are they just you know outsourcing it getting it from the cheapest available seller they may say it's organic but how do you really know so what you want to look for is verified third-party testing and that they're using a thing called green extraction methods you want to make sure that the using co2 to break down you know there's green plant leafy material to then extract that essential oil companies are they're cutting corners will you'd solvent such as acetone and residues of those solvents can then still be in the CBD oil and they themselves can be carcinogenic summer even neurotoxins the point one his third-party testing [Music] a second if you're going to be giving CBD oil to your dog your cat you want to make sure that's a whole plant extract think about it like taking vitamin C and is it more nutritious take a vitamin C tablet or eat an orange clearly is eating the orange of which I will proceed to do now maybe kill the orange summer break there are no native crazy combos this is based on a principle called the entourage effect you've got over a hundred and different separate ingredients within the canvas plant and those can all interact with each other in a very positive way going so much further in terms of promoting health and wellness that in your dog or cat versus the Dyke just singly isolating a single part a single compound and expecting that to do the same thing so if you're not clear just think orange better versus tablet not so good accurate dosing and this is one of my pet peeves I've actually treated a number of animals with cannabidiol also with THC but anytime I'm using one of these liquid tinctures it has been so difficult to get an accurate dose so you want to look for companies which are using like a medical grade tincture bottle where one drop can be carefully measured and is accurate so as you can see here with this think to your bottle my actually CBD tincture bottle one drop is one drop and you can clearly give the exact amount [Music] for what is the carrier oil so what that means is CBD comes are very concentrated from the hemp plant and a thing called the carrier oil is then added in to help with dilution also help to preserve it and make it easier for you to dose it adequately to your dog or cat most people are using this mzt oil there's a couple problems with that first of all many animals as with many people can get stomach upset from MCT oil last thing you want to have is be dosing your dog or can they're having vomiting vomiting and/or diarrhea secondly you're also asking the body to them metabolize it completely different oil from a completely different plant so if you're gonna have the you know the best benefit from using CBD cannabidiol you want it to also come from the hemp plant so in my opinion the ideal carrier oil this is hemp seed oil v can there be any drug interactions it's a great question most the sites you're gonna read on the internet safe on there's zero interaction but that being said cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver by an enzyme called cytochrome p450 and many of the veterinary drugs that your dog or cat may be on are also metabolized by that same enzyme but fortunately most dogs and cats that are on CBD they're on a low enough dose that there should not be any significant interactions so if you're dosing your dog or cat this suggests the dose of about one milligram per 10 pounds of body weight in all likelihood there won't be any significant interactions but there can be so always talk to your veterinarian before you're gonna start on CBD so if your dog or cat is in on any other veterinary medications two most common veterinary drugs that use the same enzyme the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs metagame REM Adele etc along at the corticosteroids you know such as prednisone so if your pet is on either one of those meds and there's other ones just like heart medications etc you can discuss this with your veterinarian what's the best way to be giving CBD cannabidiol to your dogs or cats it edibles you know you just squirt it into the mouth we're on a bitter there food just encourage them to eat it a CBD in an oil form is best absorbed just on your pets comes or just underneath the tongue because ideally what we want to do is bypass the stomach get higher blood levels also make it easy to give to your dog or cat you guys how easy it is to give tutuila her dose is actually one drop twice a day so she's on it support one drop is two point four milligrams I'm gonna put it on my finger and I'm just gonna rub it on your gums good girl cuz then you're gonna absorb more of that and it's gonna get into your bloodstream quicker making you feel a little bit better there okay - laughs you love the hemp seed oil you over the CBD oil you feel like their little Rastafarians nelson dog don't you good girl yes [Music] point number seven does it allow for topical absorption Murray here's a great example many cats are really difficult to get anything into their mouths or orally especially in an ongoing basis there's some research showing that CBD to be beneficial for animals with diabetes Marv he's been getting a drop a day so not only can I just put it orally put a drop of my finger and I can put this Murray you stick around and get a cap and a drop in here either I'll show him how easy it is just to put it in transdermally okay and because this CBD is decarboxylated there Murray I didn't have to put anything into your mouth well thank you guys so much for watching this edition of venery secrets I really encourage you to sign up for my upcoming webinar and cvd for dogs and cats you've yet to do so you can click that link in the box below", "y3-pdFk19e4": "We all care about our pets. Some of us even care more about our pets'\nhealth than our own health. The reality is, we really want to make sure\nthat they live a pain free life. We want to make sure that they live for a\nlong time. So in this video I want to talk about some\ninteresting ways that CBD is starting to help out the life of our furry friends. I want to start off with one particular study. The study was published in July of 2018 in\na journal known as the Frontiers of Veterinary Science. Now, what this study was looking at was overall\nthe effect of CBD oil versus placebo for pain management. Well, the results ended up being pretty darn\ninteresting. You see, what they found was utilizing what's\ncalled the Hudson Activity Score, they found that the dogs that ended up taking CBD ended\nup having much less overall pain and much more activity, and ultimately more mobility\nas well. Now, the Hudson Activity Score is just a way\nthat we can gauge basically how a pet is feeling and their pain management based on questions\nthat the owner is presented with. So, sure, it's somewhat subjective, but when\nthe responses are as stark as they are with this study, we know it's really working. You see, they saw that 80% of the dogs that\nwere in the study had decreases in pain and increases in mobility. 80%. That is pretty darn astounding. Now, here's the best part; no side effects\nwhatsoever. Normally when a dog goes on some kind of anti-inflammatory\nor pain management drug, they end up having side effects. It's hard on their liver, it's hard on their\nkidneys. There's all kinds of things that they have\nto be careful of. So CBD is seemingly a pretty harmless way\nto get a good quality of life back. Now, how does this work? Well, the thing is is dogs have the same CB1\nand CB2 receptors in their bodies that we have in ours. Simply put, what that means is that when they\ntake in CBD, their bodies end up producing more of the natural endocannabinoids. So when humans take CBD, we produce more of\nthese naturally occurring endocannabinoids that help us feel better. They elicit bliss, they make us feel calm. But they also affect our inflammatory signals\nand inflammatory markers in the body, making it so that we have less pain. Same things happens with dogs. Dogs have inflammation, and that inflammation\ncan lead to joint pain. That inflammation can lead to disease. So the cool thing is is that these endocannabinoids,\nlike andandamide, that are produced when we have CBD coming in, actually stop some of\nthe production of tumor necrosis factor 1-alpha and nuclear factor-kappa B. So it makes it\nso that these dogs can modulate inflammation better without having to take a bunch of anti-inflammatories,\nbut also target inflammation more at it's chronic core, not just for pain, but at the\ncellular level, too. Now, we can take it one step further, because\nthere are some studies that start looking at the effects of CBD on seizures in dogs. Now, some of this is a little bit inconclusive,\nso I want to go ahead and cut right to the chase. The fact is is seizures are complicated. We don't know a lot of what happens with a\nseizure in a human body or in an animal body. It's just complicated, but what we do know\nis it's some kind of disruption of the electrical system, and we have concluded that there is\nsome correlation with what is called a voltage gated sodium channel. This voltage gated sodium channels are channels\nthat allow an action potential, like the potential to move or the potential for energy, or potential\nfor electrical current from the brain to actually get somewhere. So it's really important. But if we don't have a system that's properly\nfunctioning, like with our Nav 1.1 system, which is essentially the sodium gated channel\nthat transfers that energy, that's when we have issues. That's when seizures can occur. Basically we have random surges of action\npotential and random surges of energy that should or shouldn't be there at a specific\ntime. Well, dogs have this too. CBD has been shown to inhibit the Nav 1.1,\nNav 1.1., meaning less instance for seizures to potentially occur. Now, it's so complicated because we don't\nreally know how it's working. We can only hypothesize, but the fact is we\nare seeing improvement in dogs with seizures. So it's simple. It's really a no-brainer when it comes down\nto it. We question things that we put in our bodies\nbecause there's so many bodies of research, but when it comes down to our animals, a lot\nof times we just throw it aside. We don't even think about it. But the research is there. The research that shows that dogs and cats\ncan start feeling better if they utilize CBD in an efficient way. And it's a heck of a lot cheaper than being\ndependent on pharmaceuticals for your poor furry friend all the time. As always, keep it locked in here with Octagon\nBiolabs, and I'll see you in the next video.", "Bpd7nvQQJKc": "hey guys what's up its Kenny bang and today we are going to be talking about my experience trying hemp oil for a week with my Doberman so I'm really excited for this video and let's just get right into it so a little bit of a back story before I get into this video this is my job and jazzy and she's my pride and joy she's five years old and she was not socialized properly when she was younger I'd have run throughs younger um and so she has some anxiety and insecurity when it comes to being without their dogs she's just a very high stress dog I know Dobermans as a breed can be a little bit on the higher stress side but she just kind of takes it to another level I'm a dog trainer and she's actually the reason I got into dog training because when she would feel insecure she did attack other dogs um so she kind of got me into dog training and so yeah I was really excited to film this video kind of try to figure out a solution for her problems I have taken her to the vet and they've suggested different medications like Prozac for her and I have not felt good about that it has a sat well with me to put her on a high anxiety medication when she's doing okay I just wanted a little something to take the edge off and to help her be more comfortable on a daily basis so I never really went forward with that I didn't feel good about that I have like to go the natural route and one day I was looking at hemp oil stuff and I heard how good it was not only because it helps with anxiety and pain management cancer prevention and many other things but because it's way safer than fish oil is and has the same omegas that fish oil does so it's a way safer way with way less negative side effects like fish oil has to get them there good fatty acids I already shop to a company called Empire pets they are the cutest I love their packaging and everything I'll show you in a second and I asked them if they would be willing to partner up with me because this video was something I really wanted to make so I was like I might as well reach out I saw really great reviews on their product and yes I'm going to show you their packaging and then we'll talk a little bit more okay so their packaging is so cute and a couple things I want to point out is their first thing it just says hemp oil for pets it's 100% natural it's a supplement and the ingredients are raw organic unrefined hemp seed oil it's cold-pressed and it has the suggested use for your dog's weight compared to how many drops on it which is really nice so for proven benefits it helps with allergies arthritis inflammatory bowel disease heart disease diabetes liver or kidney disease and cancer so that's a lot of great things on here on the package it doesn't say it helps with anxiety but I'm going to be showing you my experience within the last week of how I've seen it help with that here's just one clip a day from every single day of the week to kind of show how it went here we are we have the hemp oil all the dogs are going crazy as always because I said jazzy's name and jazzy really likes food so she's like can you give it to me so we're gonna try this bad boy buster try it like three times a day for best results I think I'm gonna do twice a day morning and night to start she's like yeah I mean do you want it yeah me oh she likes that I've just been giving Josie a little extra food when I give it to her I turn it with the just hemp oil the first day and she liked it but I kind of like giving her a snack I think that's better so all I do is unscrew this hold on then we just drop [Music] just don't just sit Jersey down so I'm here with Jazze we're just chillin watching the show but this is the third day of the hemp seed oil we've been doing it morning and night a little snack after the walks and stuff and I could not believe like if you look at her right now her demeanor is just a lot calmer she isn't pinning her ears back she used to always have her ears pinned back so much anxiety just in the house and as a dog trainer I was walking her hours a day she just it was one of those things where I looked into it because I was like we need something to just take that job and it's completely done that so now I'm on the couch with her she is chillin she's doing all I can see in the face hi Jesse we just got done she went for a walk this morning a training session now she's just chillin like normal and one thing that I just wanted to document really quickly is I think I used to have the preconceived notion that like because it's hemp oil it made them like dosed off they weren't listening as well she is a very very attentive still she's listening super amazing the only difference is she doesn't seem she's shaking she likes to shake thanks for your paw the only difference is she doesn't seem as stressed out as she used to be she's not overthinking things and yeah so I just wanted to point that out because I think I used to think like and trying this I was like oh no what if she isn't able to listen but she just seems a lot more calm and like she's able to enjoy a life a lot more so Josie is come lately obsessed with her homeboy that can serious but so much and it's just I cannot believe how much it's changing her temperament so later jazzy look at how calm good girl Elena jazzy no cheating good girl right now and I just really quick wanted to take a second to say when she walked she's a very challenging dog and she's not even pulling at all she just seems like she's not as stressed out walking she's just enjoying it a lot more and I'm honestly so amazed that she's just this comfortable because she used to have so much anxiety no matter how much we walked and now she's starting her walks off calm let me get the rest okay so now it's the time to talk about how I feel about the last week I'm not gonna be like Tora bearing in this I'm just gonna tell you what kind of happened what I saw and I'm a little nervous honestly just sit down and talk about it because I had such a good experience with hemp oil I saw so many things that I didn't think I was going to and just witnessed so many improvements from it so I was like dang I might come off like preach here like I really want you to get this but I honestly do because I saw so many improvements in jazzy so the one thing I really quick wanted to point out too that I found out was that fish oil actually has a lot of risks in it and the hemp oil has the Omega acid like the fatty acids without the risks so if you're getting your dog on fish oil it's probably better to switch over to hemp oil and I saw so many improvements with Jazze one that I didn't expect to see I don't know why I didn't expect to see this because a lot of use for hemp oil is for pain management and jazzy actually because she is super insecure started in a dog fight one time when she got threatened and her leg got ripped really bad so that's healed up but there's still like scar tissue and she's still wimple on it a little bit when she over exerts herself running in the yard and stuff but with the hemp oil one thing I noticed is she didn't limp ones and the smelling actually that I didn't even know was swelling I thought it was just scar tissue started to go down a little bit more so that was really cool and fascinating to see so hopefully within the weeks to follow it'll keep it going down another thing that I wanted to know is how much better jazzy got at walking and I've been working with her for a year and a half on walking and she's always been good but it's been to the point where I have to keep correcting her a little bit she's always a little bit on edge and this really just took the edge off it made her able to go on walks a lot easier she wasn't stressed and I don't think it really trained her to walk I think the last year and a half has done that but what I think it did do is get her to the point where she was calm before we went on the walk because before the walk was to get her calm and I think adding the hemp oil and as a supplement into her diet really just helped her get to the point where she was calm before we started walking I had a very good experience with hemp oil I'm going to actually start using this on my little dog now too because of just how many improvements I saw I think if you have a dog with any anxiety especially separation anxiety or anxiety around other dogs or just anxiety triggered by the outside world I think it'll be really really beneficial to try hemp oil out and also like I said if you're unofficially I'll definitely try it out make the switch so you're not putting your dog at risk and yeah I'm really excited and I think like another cool thing is how it really helps prevent cancer and a lot of different inflammatory problems that can occur so that's really nice knowing that not only is it helping with her anxiety and a more natural rather than anti-anxiety meds for dogs but it also is having a bunch of little health benefits on jazz that was really nice to know and I feel really comfortable giving this to her which I'm a crazy dog mom so I don't feel comfortable with a lot of things but if you want to get it all the way get down below and yeah I hope you enjoyed this video ok I hope you enjoyed this video I had so much fun making it let me know what you think in the comments down below and if you're willing to try it on your dog which I think you should and yeah today's future claw is going to go to let me look stinky feet geckos so thank you so much for being so supportive I love you and I love all of you and I will see you next video fine", "1mnSg9Kh8us": "In today's video I'll share with you 19\namazing ways CBD oil, nature's arthritis, anxiety, pain management and cancer\ntreatment benefits your dog. Cannabidiol, CBD is one of the most\nremarkable compounds in nature. CBD oil has proven very effective for joint pain\nand inflammation. Increasingly, clinical studies have demonstrated CBDs abilities\nto halt cancer cell growth and shrink tumors. There are 60 compounds specific\nto the cannabis plant called cannabinoids and CBD is one of them,\nwhich holds the key to a variety of medicinal and therapeutic effects that\ncannabis offers. CBD oil is extracted from the stalk,\nleaves and flowers of the cannabis plant and contains hundreds of natural\nbotanicals in concentrated form. Just as in humans a dog's body houses an\nendocannabinoid system as part of its immune system which runs throughout the\nbody, and this system is filled with receptors that bind to the cannabinoids\nin the CBD you give to your dog, and this stimulates all kinds of changes in the\nbody which are beneficial. CBD is not psychoactive, the psychoactive effect of\nthe drug cannabis comes from THC only so basically CBD won't get you dog high,\nsimply relaxed with zero psychoactive effects. And more scientific research is\nbeing conducted on the therapeutic effects of CBD than ever before as new\nand exciting evidence uncovers major medical benefits. And with this in mind\nlet's look at 19 different ways CBD oil benefits your dog. CBD provides fast\nresults, usually signs of improvement begin within days. CBD reduces stress,\nseparation anxiety and nervousness to allow your dog to be more calm and\nrelaxed. CBD reduces the effects of arthritis quickly and increases mobility.\nCBD hydrates your dog's skin. CBD reduces inflammation and alleviates joint pain\nand studies have proven CBD is highly effective at\ncanine seizures. CBD Boost's your dog's immune system to provide optimum\nprotection. CBD reduces skin irritation and itching. CBD restore shine and\nsoftness to a dog's coat. CBD improves a dog's appetite. CBD improves alertness\nand mental clarity in dogs, it improves your dog's gastrointestinal\nhealth, and it's important for effective canine cancer pain management. CBD aids\nin post-surgery recovery and it also improves comfort and pain relief for the\nlast days of life, it's also really good as a cortisone replacement. It aids in\nweight loss. CBD aids in thunderstorm and firework phobias and CBD has no known\nside-effects. I've researched these benefits myself\nover the years directly from thousands of dog owners, so I can confirm that\nthese 19 benefits are real, effective and working right now to heal canine\nailments and assist dogs all over the world. Many dog owners report that within\ndays their arthritic, limping or in pain dog is greatly improved with\nfreedom of movement a much reduced pain. There are also lots of reports of\nrenewed energy, alertness and playfulness especially in senior dogs with reduced\nanxiety, more calmness, appetite and reduced use of vet prescribed drugs and\ntheir side effects. You may even notice that once your dog is experiencing the\nbenefits, they'll happily encourage you for more. As a side note, one owner\nrelated how her dog had never let her near the dog's mouth,\nso CBD was added to the dog's food. Well the following day while the owner was\nsat in her armchair, the dog came up to her, place her head on her lap and was\neager for her to administer drops directly into her mouth.\nCBD comes in different amounts per bottle and depends on the strength\nneeded. For dogs you want it in the 350 to 500 milligram range per bottle.\nHigh-quality organic CBD oil is not cheap because extracting CBD from hemp\nrequires a lot of plant material and careful monitoring of the growing\nenvironment. I only recommend an organic product as hemp is known as a hyper\naccumulator, meaning it absorbs contaminant\nfrom the ground it grows in and will pick up heavy metal toxicity\nunless it's organically grown. CBD oil must come in a glass dropper bottle, not\nplastic and be organic. CBD is dispensed into your dog's food or can be given\ndirectly by mouth under the tongue. I recommend giving under your dog's tongue\nif that's possible as it's more effective by this method, simply because\nit gets directly into your dog's bloodstream rather than eaten with food,\nwhich means your dog's liver will filter out some of its effectiveness. It's\nimportant to note that prices range wildly from $20 to $65 plus for a 250 to\n500 milligram one ounce bottle full plant organic extraction. This gives you\n8.3 milligrams of actual CBD, enough to be effective with dogs for the\nbenefits I discussed. Another important thing to note is that I've been working\nwith CBD oil for 15 years and it's only recently that CBD products have taken\noff and for good reason. However the information on CBD oil can be confusing\nas large online retailers like Amazon are not allowing product manufactures to\nmention CBD in their advertising and so confusion arises about whether any given\nproduct is true CBD oil or just made using the hemp seeds, not the whole plant\nextract. So I'll link to a product in the description below\nthat's genuine CBD oil, it's organically grown in Colorado USA and has been\nextracted using co2 full plant extraction and contains all the\nbeneficial terpenoids, flavonoids, essential oils, vitamins A and D, trace\nminerals, phytochemicals and omega-6 and three oils for dogs and cats. And for\nchronic health conditions like phobias and fearfulness, you can give half the\nstate to dosage and this will mean cost savings while still getting effective\nresults. My recommendation is to start with half the stated dosage, observe the\neffects for five days and work up to a full stated dosage if you don't see\nnoticeable effects for the condition intended. If your dog has major health\nissues like cancer, try working up to a double dose, as every dog, just like\npeople have their optimal dose, and there are no side\neffects other than a potential to sleep more soundly during the day. If your\ndog suffers arthritic conditions and especially if they're on vet\nprescribed medications for the condition don't even second-guess this natural\nalternative, get a bottle, stop the meds and treat with CBD and you'll be amazed\nat its effectiveness, without the side effects and the expense of veterinary\ndrugs. Raise the dose if you need to, it's safe and to find an effective level for\nlonger term use and the side benefits and numerous has discussed. Also if your\ndog has arthritic movement issues, an excellent complimentary dog supplement\nto feed alongside the CBD is bacon flavored soft chews, they contain many\nnatural ingredients including the CBD to aid pain free movement with universally\nexcellent feedback. They're also USA made with a hundred percent money-back\nguarantee with excellent customer service, again I'll leave a link to these\nin the description below.

can see all the ratings here you can check that out you click on it all the information's here and then coming down here you'll see the capsules because some people prefer to take the capsules it's easier it's simpler no dropper two people can share it we're here you know do you really want to put another dropper one dropper and share it with someone we're here you can just share it and then of course there's another one where it includes vitamin c d and zinc which is really nice down here we have gummies gummies are available and this is all full spectrum by the way there's chewing gum and

store at hello MD today we're going to be looking at a raw full spectrum hemp oil extract from cured I'm really excited to talk about this because it is a full plant extract so unlike a CBD isolate which will work on its own this product contains all of the other cannabinoids that naturally occur in the plant they work together synergistically to give you the most benefit from the CBD there's 30 milliliters and 500 milligrams of total cannabinoids in each bottle all cured products are made with Colorado grown organic hemp the ingredients are full spectrum hemp extract and MCT oil MCT oil is a very healthy fat that metabolizes quickly it's hard to see but on the other ingredients it lists may contain CBD CBD a CBG cbc cbn and THC all in less than 0.3 percent these are other cannabinoids similar to CBD that allow this product to be most effective by using the whole plant it's very easy to use you simply unscrew the cap take a dropper full which is about 17 milligrams of CBD and squirt it directly under your tongue now you want to keep the oil there for about 30 to 60 seconds to allow it to absorb sublingually it means it'll feel the effects a lot faster than if you simply swallow it I personally tried some of this oil to treat some pain in my shoulder and felt the effects in about five minutes but I also noticed a general sense of centeredness and commet then typically feel when I use the CBD product so in my opinion it's an extremely effective product that works very quickly you can check out the cure or other hemp CBD products at hello MD com thank you and we'll see you next time you", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "NtFSeWNJCHg": "so our full spectrum that CBD and hemp tincture is the baseline for everything I use I use this in the morning and in the evening I personally do the thousand milligrams so one dropper full is about 33 like what does that even mean half in the morning is somewhere around 16 milligrams and in the evening why because I like to start my day and ease into it knowing that I'm giving my body what it needs to be stress-free and in the evening of course that's part of my relaxing and going to bed regimen but this hemp in here started on our farm again with our family of farmers and it's full spectrum it's the whole thing in here so this is just what I do like a little half drop like that under the tongue hold it there over there for like 15 20 seconds and then swallow what's left over and baseline yeah I use it as a baseline every single day I wouldn't travel without it and I just add lots of other things to it", "hoYe6eja0YU": "let's review our broad-spectrum oils our plant health broad-spectrum oil is a hundred percent natural hemp oil extract and various potencies this is a pure

hemp oil suspension has many B vitamins present within the oil and can be beneficial for gastrointestinal issues CBD benefits include mediation of pain inflammation and anxiety due to its influence to the 5 ht1 alpha hydroxy tryptamine serotonin receptor the augmentation of Amanda mine also brings on a GABA tone in the neurological field and helps to lower cortisol which is a stress molecule so CBD helps calm the mind this product is manufactured in sanitary ISO certified conditions the only thing you want to be aware of with any pure hemp oil product is that some people's stomach might be a little bit sensitive to the material especially at higher dosages so if you find that you have any dysbiosis or you have any loose stools back off on your dose again we always suggest starting with a lower dosage if you've never taken CBD before start with somewhere between 5 and 10 milligrams per day and slowly increase your dosage every 3 to 5 days until you start to feel the change let us know

CBD is everywhere so right now I'll show you the lab results and then I'll go over everything good or bad that I found on CBD FX let's get to it okay they claim 500 milligrams one thing here I don't like that the label doesn't say milligrams on the front 500 series what does that mean but anyway that's a small thing they claimed 500 milligrams of CBD and our lab tests found 624 milligrams of cannabinoids and that includes 595 milligrams of CBD that's 19% more CBD more CBD is better than less but accuracy is also important and this ain't exactly accurate but it's alright this is a breakdown of the cannabinoids you see CBD d CB c CB g CB DV it's a decent broad-spectrum CBD that means no THC however they claim it's full spectrum full spectrum should have THC and that's a problem for the people that want the additional benefits of THC they expect it and they're not getting it you can see the official lab results here by the way and the link to this review is in the notes below cost per milligram of CBD it's good 12 cents under 15 cents is good some are 5 cents and my last video I think I had one that was 30 cents so this isn't bad not great just good an American good maybe a British OK I like the ingredients MCT oil helps with the absorption healthy fats increase the absorption of CBD and nothing else but the CBD oil well they say it's a full spectrum CBO but you need the THC for that for all those of them dismal effects man here's the milliliter dose breakdown okay about the company CBD effects is out of Chatsworth California I'm in Santa Cruz so I give it to the California companies even though they're getting abused by the taxes I'm sure they won't pass those on to you those costs but good regulations here in California though okay over a hundred products in 61 countries plus urban outfitters in Kroger damn they're big company that's that's good the Kroger part I don't know about Urban Outfitters I don't even know if they're still in business I really couldn't find anything bad about them as far as negative reports I searched for about a dozen keywords and they come up clean they did have a d-minus rating previously with the BBB Better Business Bureau but I just checked and it's up to an a-minus so looks like they took care of any issues they might have had with consumers that's it I told you a short if you appreciate that I paid for an

treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "b8jdkbwXuvc": "[background music] Cody: Hey all, it's Cody from Sleepopolis,\nand today we're taking a look at the CBD PM Sleep Aid from cbdMD. Packed with all-natural CBD oil and melatonin,\nthis product is designed to lull even the most restless sleeper straight off to dreamland,\nbut does it actually work? To find out, I tested the oil myself and let\nme tell you, I was genuinely surprised with the way it affected my slumber. Was it good, bad, awful, magical? I guess you'll just have to watch this video\nto see. Since launching in 2015, cbdMD has been on\na mission to produce the highest quality CBD oil in the industry. Though that's quite the lofty aim, the brand\nis endeavored to pulling off with the rigorous third-party testing and to focus on domestic\nhemp production here in the United States. In addition to it's more straightforward oil\ntinctures, the brand also sells CBD capsules, gummies, sleep aids, topical creams, vape\noils, bath bombs, and CBD oil for pets. The kind folks over at cbdMD were nice enough\nto send a ton of these herb products for us to try, many of which I was able to test out\non my own. We are going to be focusing almost exclusively\non the CBD PM oil on this review. I will say though that of the other products,\nI really loved these CBD gummies. You take one or two a day and you get this\nreally nice, strong, relaxing vibe that made me feel totally zen as I was going about my\nday. Out of these other products, I would definitely\nrecommend checking out the gummies. Back to the CBD PM tincture. To start, we're going to talk about all the\ningredients in this oil. The CBD PM Sleep Aid from cbdMD is both primarily\nwith CBD oil and melatonin. A lot of you out there may already be familiar\nwith melatonin, but the term CBD may be a bit of a head scratcher. Let me break it down for you. CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of more than a\nhundred different phytocannabinoids contained within the flower of the cannabis plant. The most popular, which is the psychoactive\ntetrahydracannabinol or THC. However, unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive. I repeat, CBD does not trigger hallucinations\nor intoxication and is most commonly incorporated into creams and oils to treat everything from\njoint pain to anxiety, loss of appetite, and yes, even poor sleep. I should also add that it's totally legal\nto buy, purchase, and sell hemp-derived CBD in all 50 states. While the Internet has been buzzing about\nCBD's positive health benefits for years, there hasn't been that much research done\ninto its side effects. However, a 2011 survey, which aggregated data\nfrom numerous studies, did find CBD to be totally safe up to doses of up to 1,500 milligrams\nper day. In a 2017 study, which sought to add data\nto that survey, further found that not only was CBD safe for long-term chronic use, it\nalso had a better side effect profile when treating certain medical conditions like epilepsy\nand psychotic disorders. CBD is not the only thing that's going on\nin this oil. As I mentioned up top, there's also a lot\nof melatonin. Melatonin is the body's sleepy hormone. The idea here is that when you take an outside\nsource of melatonin and add it to your body's own natural supply, you're essentially increasing\nits overall effectiveness. We've got the CBD oil, we've got the melatonin,\nso what else is in this tincture? We've got a bit of what cbdMD is calling their\nproprietary blend. That's a blend of all-natural ingredients\nmeant to help induce, calm, and reduce anxiety. This blend is made up of Valerian root, chamomile,\nCascade hops, and lemon balm. To finish everything off, there is just a\nbit of mint flavoring, which helps to get rid of some of CBD's grassy taste. Now that we've gone over the ingredients,\nlet's get into my experience with the CBD PM Sleep Aid. The CBD PM Sleep Aid comes in a 30-serving\nbottle and retails for $45. If you're taking the oil for restlessness,\nthe brand recommends taking a full dropper of this stuff every night about 15 to 30 minutes\nbefore bed. A full dropper contains 16 milligrams of CBD\nand about 5 milligrams of melatonin. For reference, that's a pretty low to mild\ndosage of CBD and a really high one of melatonin. You may want to play around with the dosage\nto find the one that's going to be right for you. They recommend taking a full dropper but they\nalso say that maybe a half dropper could work for you, a quarter of a dropper. I would suggest playing around with the dosage\na little bit. I'm about six feet tall, 165 pounds, and already\nfamiliar with CBD and melatonin so I decided to take a full dropper every night before\nbed. When I talk about my experience, I'm going\nto break it down into falling asleep, staying asleep, and the morning after. Before I do any of that, I've got to let you\nin on a little secret. Though I would look fabulous in a white lab\ncoat, I'm not a doctor so everything I'm about to share with you is based solely on my personal\nexperience. If you're looking to change your sleep regime\nor looking to try CBD or melatonin for the first time, I highly recommend that you consult\nwith a medical professional before doing so. All right, now let's jump into my experience,\nstarting with falling asleep. One of my biggest nighttime problems is falling\nasleep. As soon as my head hits the pillow, it feels\nlike my mind is swirling with dozens of thoughts and ideas, which make it so difficult to slip\ninto the syrupy half-consciousness of slumber. When I'm looking at a new supplement, I really\nneed to know that it's going to be able to relax my body and quiet those thoughts so\nI can get to sleep. I've got to say the CBD PM Sleep Aid was a\nreal winner in that department. About 15 minutes after taking the supplement,\nI could feel this really intense wave of calm washing over my body. My shoulders felt relaxed. Even my knee caps were relaxed. I just felt totally zen. My thoughts were quieted as well so it was\nreally easy for me to get to sleep. If falling asleep is my number one problem,\nstaying asleep is a very close number two. For me, most nights I wake up in the middle\nof the night around 2:00 or 3:00 AM, either from a stray thought or a bad dream or simply\nbecause my body is so tired of trying to fall asleep that it's desperately hoping that it's\nmorning. When a take a new supplement, I need to know\nthat it's not only going to knock me out, but it's going to keep me dreaming all the\nway until morning. Unfortunately, the CBD PM Sleep Aid didn't\nreally do that for me. It was really easy for me to fall asleep when\nI took it, but it didn't keep me sleeping throughout the night. I found that I woke up most nights around\n2:00 or 3:00 AM. Finally, the morning after. Typically when I take melatonin supplements,\nI notice a deep sense of a grogginess the next day. My limbs are really heavy, my mind is foggy,\nso much so that it makes me wonder if it was even worth taking the sleep aid in the first\nplace. The morning after is a really important factor\nfor me to consider when thinking about sleep supplements. I'm happy to report that the CBD PM sleep\nsupplement didn't leave me feeling groggy at all. I felt clearheaded and ready to go in my day. [background music] Cody: All right, now that we've gone over\nthe ingredients and dug into my experience, it's time to wrap up this sucker with some\npros and cons. Let's start with the pros. First and foremost, I loved how well the sleep\nsupplement was able to get me to sleep. I found that as soon as I took it, about 15\nto 30 minutes afterwards I was feeling calm, relaxed, and ready to drift off to dreamland. Number two, it tasted great. CBD usually has this grassy, mossy taste to\nit, but the mint flavoring that they put into this sleep aid really made it taste super\nyummy. If you've stayed away from CBD because of\nthe taste, I think that this could be a real winner for you. Finally, price. At $45, that's a pretty affordable price for\nCBD, which usually goes for around $100 and $140. I think price-wise, it's a nice budget buy. Now to the cons. First and foremost, the CBD PM Sleep Aid didn't\nreally help me to stay asleep. Though I got to bed super easily, I found\nthat I woke up most nights around 2:00 or 3:00 AM. Secondly, it was kind of hard to open. Most of these oils that have the dropper,\nyou know, you push down and twist off and it's really easy, but for some reason I had\ntrouble opening this one. If you're someone who has difficulty opening\npill bottles or other oral tincture things, you may want to watch out for that here.

I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "AgQyBw5YRw0": "hey guys Alicia here so today I'm super excited to talk about something that you could actually find online and try for yourself okay it's a CBD oil so for anyone out there who's suffered from an injury whether it was sports related work-related or whatever you know the pain and the frustration that comes with that kind of injury you also know that most of the pain medications that doctors will prescribe you just don't ever really take away the pain fully or even at all actually that's why if you're struggling right now with pain or even anxiety it's time you checked out non-traditional medicine so CBD has so many positive effects and there are so many studies and TV shows and articles that really back this way of treatment and so many people can be so so skeptical and I get it but honestly if you are suffering and you are in constant pain what do you have to lose and for most people the results are a very welcome surprise I would say most people are seeing results between like what three and four days sometimes less but yeah I just wanted to quickly make this video to share with everyone something that could seriously change their life and help them start actually feeling better", "42VWI-ArKPU": "hey guys I'm back and I'm reviewing Bluebird botanicals they actually sent me a 1500 milligram CBD oil so this is what it looks like so that is that I've been using it for roughly about two to three weeks and I've been switching it off between my other CBDs so I haven't solely been using this one but I have been using it a lot and it kind of helps just like seeing day to day which CBDs work for me and how they differ from each other so I've been using a lot of my met Tara that I reviewed last time and the Bluebird botanicals I think about the same which is like 25 milligrams to 35 milligrams for each depending on the day and what I need what I've noticed difference wise I met Tara as I said before is more of like a clear calming feeling and I could feel like clear-headed clear minded while I'm on it whereas with the bluebird coat a Nicole's I get kind of like I guess they're gonna loose feeling or a headache kind of calming feeling which they're both great I really enjoy the differences to be each I guess they just differ on what I need them for so if I have a day where I'm not doing anything and I'm just chillin and hanging out then I really like to use the Bluebird botanicals because I like that other feeling and just being able to like know that I'm on CBD and like hang out and chill whereas the matera when I use it I like to use it at work or if I'm like having to run around and not really feeling like I can like completely chill out it helps me be calm but still be clear minded and be able to multitask and do a ton of stuff not saying that I can't multitask on Bluebird botannical but I like not feeling or not knowing that I'm on CBD when I'm doing a whole bunch of things and just like having that calm kind of in the back of my mind not necessarily at the forefront but yeah they have both been great and I guess more about the Bluebird mechanicals it's six times concentrated the 1500 milligrams like I said I've been doing the 25 to 35 milligrams depending on what I need that day another great thing to look into with the Bluebird roti nicole's is the batch number online so they'll give it to you on the back of the bottle mine has rubbed off a little bit because it's been in and out of different curses and I've been traveling with it and stuff but you can look up the batch number online and it'll give you the exact you know COAS certificate of analysis of this batch that they made so you can see the residual solvents the microbes and terpenes and the purity and potency and just know what you're ingesting into your body which is great so look into that if you do get you know got a CBD oil because it's good to know what you're taking aside from that taste wise it kind of tastes a little bit bitter I'll give you a spot reference so it is it's it's pretty bitter compared to my other CBDs and it's not bitter to the point that it's disgusting I mean it's fine it's whatever it goes down smoothly but it tastes a little bit more bitter um kind of more plant like and it has like an irony taste like on the tip of your tongue I guess but yeah it goes down smoothly and it's not disgusting it's more compared to my other CBDs it's more of like a blackish-brown tinted color to it which is interesting yeah it's main and bottled in Colorado so that's really cool the weed state yeah okay I think what else I could tell you guys on this one like I said before let all see bees on your tongue for like 30 seconds to a minute just so that it could absorb into your body faster and you can get the effects the CBD sooner yeah alright so that's it for the 1500 milligrams CBD bottle that they gave me next on the list they also gave me a hemp companion so for my puppy dog they gave me 250 milligrams and for about 15 drops it's forty two milligrams I've been giving him anywhere from like 7 to 15 drops just to see how he likes it and how he reacts to it I I use it when I know he has a lot of anxiety that day and how I know is when I leave my house I can hear him whine because he gets a little bit needy some days when I leave and that's how I know you know he has more anxiety that day or he needs me around or so I've been giving him CBD on those days and also when we travel so when we go on flights and things it helps him just like chill out and relax like CBD helps me obviously I guess what I've noticed is that he stops whining as much if I give him some CBD and he just like chills out and calms down you know like takes a nap or something or just like doesn't feel the need to be so anxious and need me around when I leave he loves it and it's helped him on the plane yeah I'm still seeing how much he needs depending on his day but I basically variate depending on if he's like you know more whining about when I leave on things and if he's feeling that anxious feeling to have me around yeah it's been working for him he's been chilling out with me so we've been on our CBD kicks let me show you what the ball roll looks like and last on the list I got a hemp CBD vape juice thirty-three hundred and thirty three milligrams currently I have not tested it I don't have a vape pen yet but I'm going to be getting one and I'll do a review on it as soon as I tested it out and things I'm super stoked about it because I haven't smoked CBD yet and yeah I'm just excited to see how it goes I did accidentally taste some of it because so my bottle that I was using for CBD oil I brought it over when we were when I was going out with my friends and they broke they dropped it and broke the little distributor cap or whatever this guy it broke and so I didn't have a top for it that's why I have the tinfoil on this one because I've had to cover it and just like use my dropper like switch between using my dropper for me and my dog but at first I was like trying to use this dropper and it's too small to even get into this bottle so like when I used it I tasted some of the fake juice and it was it was pretty disgusting it was a very strong taste and obviously you probably shouldn't be ingesting it that way anyway yeah I think that's it so overall it has been a great experience I love Bluebird mechanicals so far and compared to my other CDs I love the aloof feeling of it and just being kind of like noticeably more chill whereas my matera is not noticeably more chill but obviously I still enjoy the effects but yeah depending on my situation I do love Bluebird botanicals and I suggest that you guys test it out because it's great stuff stay tuned I'm going to be doing some more reviews on different CBDs coming up and possibly like the next week two weeks three weeks just keep on the lookout and I will be back thanks for tuning in guys you", "gwPdmwRbT2g": "[Music] pets help us with our anxiety and cbd helps with theirs basically cbd helps them calm down in situations such as holidays and special occasions when there's fireworks going off and they get very startled also cbd helps keep them calm when we introduce new members of the family to them such as new babies or if we have guests coming over it just helps keep them calm in those occasions as well as keep their coat nice and smooth and prevents dander and dry skin", "Qofq6bjOlh4": "[Music] hey guys Justin Ross here with green valley Nation I'm gonna give you a quick review of CB distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil CV distillery uses American grown hemp that is non GMO not certified organic but it is third-party tested in each one milliliter dose of CBD oil you get 33 milligrams of CBD which is printed clearly here on the box see if you're still earning one thousand milligrams CBD oil uses a co2 extraction method they don't add any flavors to the oil itself they do use coconut oil as a carrier so that the product tastes like coconut oil and hemp plant so if the smell or the taste of hemp is not something you enjoy that might be something that you want to consider when purchasing this product see distillery 1,000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil comes in this individually packaged in this nice bright orange box with CBD really easy to read across the top the other thing about this package is the milligrams of CBD per dose or easy to read right here on the front as well and each box comes with a informative pamphlet kind of gives you a little information about CP distillery itself and the product and how they extract the oil and all that the other thing I like about this is the label on the bottle matches the label on the box so if you lose the box no big deal so I'm taking CV distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil for about six months now I usually take between 20 and 35 milligrams at one time I started taking it to see how it would help in my chronic back and knee pain and I noticed after about 20 minutes that I had significant reduction in pain and inflammation in my lower back and my knee I also take it in the evenings before bed to help me calm down from the day so that I sleep well all through the night and I don't wake up with any pain that's an added bonus so the things I like about CP distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil is that it takes away the pain after only 1/2 I can also take it before bed and it'll help me sleep all night soundly and I'll wake up without any pain in the morning the other thing is that it's easy to fit this into my monthly budget the cons are the plant light flavor and the fact that I don't feel like it's quite as strong as some of the others that are in a similar concentration so overall if you're looking for a more economical high concentrated full-spectrum CBD oil and you don't mind a little bit of a plant flavor you can't go wrong with CBS tillery's 1000 milligram full-spectrum or CBD oil my name is Judson Ross and if you liked this review and would like more be sure to follow us at Green Valley nation for your most comprehensive review on hemp products [Music]", "pJAu3xO0IzQ": "hello viewers alright so today I want to talk about one of my favorite CBD companies met Tara and present a few of their CBD products so if after watching this video you're interested in buying if you have these products just click the link in the video description for the best prices alright so why do I love met Tara so much a few reasons they have affordable prices they provide 99% pure CBD that's grown in the u.s. they're a hundred percent natural and non-gmo which means they're free of any contaminants they contain zero THC meaning that they can ship internationally except for Canada and Australia sorry guys they have to ship really fast and they provide really fast customer support and they have a great variety of products so I just wanted to present a few of those products to you alright so I'm gonna start with the CBD oil which is the most common CBD product around they sell these in three different strengths they have be 500 a thousand and 3,000 milligrams and those start at 3499 the the oil has minimal taste you can put it in pretty much anything which is just makes it really easy to consume you can put it in your morning coffee or you can even use it externally if you want to rub it on an area in pain or if you're feeling any discomfort they have the CBD gel capsules so these are just really easy to take with a glass of water for a regular or even daily intake they have two strengths for these capsules the 25 milligrams and the 50 milligrams and it starts at $44.99 these are also travel friendly since they contain zero THC so you can even take these on an international flight which can be really convenient if you just want to take a cool relaxing no stress flight they even have a specific morning blend that combines the CBD with caffeine and the b6 and b12 vitamins so it gives you that really good energy boost to start your day off right then they have the dissolvable sleep tablets they start at $55.99 and those combined CBD with 10 milligrams of melatonin so if you need a little help getting to sleep at night then these would be the perfect solution for you they're also spearmint flavored so you can take those right after brushing your teeth and it won't you know screw up your fresh breath just put it under your tongue let it dissolve and to just sleep like a baby these are a great option if you're trying to weave off sleeping pills these are natural products and don't have like weird side effects like sleeping pills can so I really recommend for you to try these and as med Tara has a 30-day money-back guarantee then you have nothing to lose so give it a go that may have the cooling creams which is great if you have any eggs and pains in a specific area they provide the cooling creams in a few dosage they have the 250 and the 750 milligram starting at $49.99 those are a blend of CBD menthol and arnica that provides that rapid cooling effect to help with any muscle or joint discomfort I've been using the creams to help with knee pain after I go for a run outside I don't know if it happens to you but when I run on the pavement my knees kind of hurt and the CBD creams have really helped with that and lastly they have the pet products so if you are an animal lover like myself if you've got a cat or dog that's a little old or you know needs help getting around or is is nervous taking a flight I really recommend you tried the CBD oil for pets these are great to mix in with their food and they offer those in true format so you can give these to your dogs or your cat as a treat oh and they offer different bundles depending on your needs they've got the comfort bundle they've got the evening wellness bundle that contains the oil and the capsules if you're having trouble sleeping and they have a few pet bundles as well all right thank you for watching if you're interested in any of these products just head to the link in the video description it has the best deals and it's updated regularly all right have a great day", "LQO8AIEbr7k": "[Music] the next thing up for review here is our

pets sleep decrease nausea for travel or whatever they got going on anti-inflammatory it's a fantastic product it is organic it's double tested it's a authentic and you're going to love it your dogs you know that's for sure [Music]", "Ue5Kk_UsSbw": "[Music] hey guys it's Brandi with green wellness life I am here today to chat with you about a new line that we've decided to carry a cream on this life from koi that's koi like the fish koe they've got a pretty broad range of products including topicals lots of vapes tinctures as well and we've started by carrying just a few of the options to see when people think of them so this product line is new for us we would love to hear your feedback love to hear what you think they do have a few things going for them that are unique that that's one of the reasons that we decided to start carrying this product it's apparently Wild Kingdom day in my house today because I've got a cat fully distracted so here we go this is normal see people alright let's start with the tinctures we've chosen to carry the koi Naturals tinctures and orange flavor they also have a lemon line and then they also have a line that has not considered their natural so what makes it natural you say well they've not added any color into it and they're not using any artificial flavors so that is what makes its eligible to be in their Naturals line so we're carrying their t-shirt their orange t-shirt in two strengths a 500 and a thousand milligrams both of the bottles are gonna look like this little cutesy black frost and bottles and they've got the same ingredient list so they've got the full spectrum CBD natural orange extract and coconut oil so again a lot of our products do contain MCT or coconut oil as the base so that's something to be mindful of if you've got a coconut sensitivity definitely reach out if you want to to avoid that otherwise it's a great healthy oil to add into our bodies so one thing that is unique about koi and one reason we decided to carry out is that they utilize a process that manufactures a full spectrum oil with zero THC so you might have heard me talk about isolate before where the CBD compound is ice and added in to a product one they do the opposite they isolate the THC and yank it out so they're leaving him the rest of the full spectrum the plant matter and the other cannabinoids that are naturally occurring in hunt plants they leave it all there so that's pretty cool they've also figured out how to make it taste decent so with the tincture you're just gonna shake it up and then measure it out so we talked a lot unfortunately this one does not have a measurements on the pipette boo we wish that everybody did because boy wouldn't that make serving sizes a little easier and we talked in terms of full drops full droppers so when you press and release the bulb top here you can see I think you can see then that's really about three-quarters of the way full it's not all the way full but that's considered a full dropping your full dropper rather you're gonna get about forty of those out of each and B is one ounce bottles so on a 500 milligram we do that math handy-dandy calculator take 500 divide it by the forty servings at a full dropper pool which really looks like more like 3/4 you're gonna get about 12 and 1/2 milligrams of CBD so that is a reasonable middle of the road starting serving size if you find you want to step it up then you could always look at going to the thousand milligram because then you'd be getting more like 25 per dropper again zero THC otherwise full spectrum this is the orange mmm it smells in it taste it's actually really good they've done a nice job of adding a flavoring that compliment that hemp flavor and really controls it so the orange is really nice that is Charlie that is moseying around the table no worries we never actually eat at the dining room table it's strictly for show okay moving on we've also carried the koi gummies gummies have a little bit high price point per milligram of CBD we get a lot of requests for them and I was pretty Costin to carry them there was a company with a similar name to ours that was manufacturing some gummies that were not terrific and putting people on monthly reorder programs so we got a lot of calls for them when we were initially in business thankfully they have disappeared and we've had a lot of requests for gummies so we did decide to carry them I'm in my opinion a Gumby is a good booster I got occasional if you if you just need that quick boost of CBD it's not something I would include daily as a supplement the price points not great and then quite frankly it's a gummy so it's got all of the stuff in it that you would consider a gummy to be it does have gelatin so this is not a vegan product something to keep in mind does have artificial colors what they have done though in is that a lot of companies just kind of dust the CBD on the top and they actually use it all the way in the gummy so they believe that to be a better product I will tell you I have eaten a lot of gummies too many guys and these are actually really good so they taste good and I have noticed that if I'm struggling a bit in the day then they do give me the boost that I'm looking for so good product good occasional booster if you will to add into your daily regimen if you're looking for coming we're also carrying the Kois soft shoes the price point again on these is a little high it's higher than some of the other dog treats that we carry we're kind of talking about this for the picky pups so these are nice and soft and meaty they are pretty small two and a half milligrams of CBD per juice and you've got a big dog keep in mind that you'd be giving them a few of them but the dogs really like them kara that I work with she has a great day have a seat Lily oh good dog she has a Great Dane named Molly that will not touch any of our other pet products this is a serious dog snap not interested and she goes crazy for these helps if I show them so you got a picky eater that you're looking to add some meaty into their regimen this might be a good fit for you 25 choose about two point five milligrams of CBD per chew and they really like them Lily is enjoying hers camera right now okay then we move into the e-liquid quois got lots and lots of you liquids to choose from we chose two flavors and two strengths as a starting point something to keep in mind when you're buying a bottle a liquid which is what these are they're not in a cartridge form and they're not disposable these are bottles so keep in mind how many tanks you're going to be getting out of that bottle for example this is the koi a thousand milligram this is the blue the flavor of the blue I don't know if you can see that but it's blue raspberry and dragon fruit that is the flavor of this one this is a traditional a liquid in a bottle which means it does contain VG it does contain a PG so vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol if you're someone who's concerned about those ingredients and it's not something you would want to add they really like Italy everything smells plus I'm not usually home during the day so I think that it's an added benefit any you not really okay these do have VG and PG in them which means that you get that nice big smoke and a nice smooth vaping experience they taste wonderful but these are not the natural signs they do contain some artificial flavors they are a little stronger that as I was mentioning before I got distracted is you have to keep in mind how big new tank is and how many tanks you're gonna get out of it so the tanks that we carry and sell are just little guys these are a point 5 ml is the line where you're going to fill it up so this is a 30 ml bottle so you're gonna get sixty tanks so again if we grab our calculator and do our math this is a thousand milligram CBD bottle right so if we're gonna divide that if I get my calculator to work that'd be super so I was a milligram bottle we're gonna divide it but we're gonna see how many of the tanks we can get so we'll know how much our thousand is so we know 30ml bottle 0.5 milliliter tanks so that's gonna fill this little tiny tank that we carry 60 times so a thousand milligrams in a bottle divided by six seriously 16 so when we've got some of our high-strength cartridges that we carry from other manufacturers that are about 250 milligrams per tank this is going to be about 16 milligrams per tank so something to consider that it's not going to be nearly as strong with that set these do taste wonderful and they've ate really really nicely so if you're someone who really likes that traditional CBD vape no nicotine know th team wants it to taste delicious and sweet like candy then this is a good fit but if you're looking to stay away from VG or PG then I wouldn't go this route or if you're looking for something that's going to be really strong to me then this isn't going to be a great thing for you between this and my animals that apparently need all the screen time in the world I think that's where we are going to wrap it up we are here and available if you've got questions concerns anything that we can help you with that's what we're here for so our email is support at green wellness Life come again that support at Green Lomas life.com

is in full spectrum a broad spectrum and the spectrum really refers to the different compounds that are in the natural extract so when you think of a CBD oil it's not just CBD that's in that oil there's different fats there's different terpenes potentially different cannabinoids and other things that create the full picture and so in that sense a full spectrum product would be just that it has the entire full spectrum of naturally occurring compounds that are found in that extract so on the totally other side of the spectrum would be what's considered an isolate and as that sounds it's the CBD that's been stripped away and isolated from all the other naturally occurring compounds in that extract and then in the middle between an isolate and a full-spectrum extract you have the whole range of broad spectrum and as that sounds it doesn't necessarily have the full set of compounds but it has a lot of them or most of them for example at uncanny wellness we remove the THC from our products so that is technically part of the spectrum which is why we don't call ours a full spectrum extract instead it's a broad spectrum extract so it has the CBD it has the terpenes the flavonoids and all those other naturally occurring compounds in the extract a common misconception that people have is that you need THC in order for CBD to work properly there is some truth in that because THC and CBD work synergistically together but you don't need the THC for the CBD to work going off of that something like an isolate would work it just doesn't work necessarily as well as a full spectrum product so full spectrum is going to have apps everything in it as such if you remove any part of that spectrum whether you're removing the THC or even if you're distilling down and concentrating what's in the extract you're getting into the territory of broad spectrum so really most of what's out there in the market is gonna be a broad spectrum and not a full spectrum because full is just a very absolute phrase and as a natural result of the processing and extraction and refinement in to that final product form you do lose certain parts of that spectrum another important thing to understand is that the spectrum a full spectrum broad spectrum directly relates to what's known as the entourage effect and the entourage effect basically says that when you have CBD in conjunction with the other naturally occurring compounds that it's usually found with it has a greater amplified effect versus an isolate which is just CBD has no entourage has no other components of the spectrum and is less effective than a full or broad spectrum product so you can kind of think of it like there's more entourage effect happening the more full the spectrum is and as you start taking things away you're removing naturally-occurring compounds from that spectrum you're losing members of the entourage and over time you go all the way to an isolate format which has no entourage effects happening whatsoever the nice thing about a broad spectrum extract is that you can do something like THC removal which is what we do and that's nice for people that may have to get drug tested or just don't want any trace THC in their system or maybe they want to give it to their kids or a pet or they're a pilot or any reason like that they can still enjoy the benefits of the entourage effect and of a broad spectrum CBD extract without having any residual THC because the legal limit for hemp products is 0.3 percent THC so a full spectrum product could have at most 0.3% but you could easily remove that making a broad spectrum or end up removing everything for an isolate for most people the best option for a CBD product is going to be a full or broad spectrum extract isolates are kind of the pharmaceutical reduction of CBD it strips it away from everything else reducing its holistic nature and making it more controllable as such isolates are the cheapest form of CBD available and a lot of times people will actually just throw isolate into a product to make it a really high milligram count and then end up charging you more even though you're getting a lesser quality product so when you're out there trying to figure out which CBD product is best for you it's fair to either ask the company or look for where it says it on the label to see is it isolate broad spectrum or full spectrum and that should help you decide exactly what you're looking for so in summary on one end you have an absolutely full spectrum product that's gonna have the most other compounds besides CBD and it's going to have the most entourage effect on the other end you have an isolate where the CBD is stripped away from all the other naturally naturally occurring compounds there are no extra compounds in the extract and there's going to be no entourage effect and then in the middle you would have the range of broad-spectrum extracts that don't have all the naturally occurring compounds but have most of them and you're still getting the benefits of the entourage effect because of the turbines the flavonoids the polyphenols and all of the other array of compounds that are naturally present in a CBD hemp extract so that's it that's the breakdown between full spectrum and broad spectrum and isolate thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a like

Welcome to Remedy Review. My name is Melena, and today we're gonna be unboxing and reviewing CBDistillery CBD\noil. I ordered this package last week, so it came pretty fast it got in the other\nday. So, this is a really cute graphic from CBDistillery. They're based out of\nColorado, so this screams like Colorado skiing vibes to me. There's a couple of\nother like fun things in this box but we'll get to those later. This is the CBD\noil that I purchased. It is a thousand milligrams in total or 33 milligrams per\nserving which is basically just the amount of CBD that's gonna be in a full\ndropper of the tincture. So, I'm actually gonna try that right now. I've never\ntried their CBD oil before so I'm not exactly sure what its gonna taste like\nor anything so we'll just give that a go. Oh, yeah it's definitely a very easy CBD\noil to take. It has a mild, earthy flavor. It's not as much as I thought it would\nbe considering it's a full spectrum product, but it's definitely natural and\nsmooth overall. The oil itself is pretty smooth - it's so clean when you see it on\nthere. Like it's very orange in this bottle but like there it's like that's\nhow I felt about Naternal, I was like oh it looks so clear on there. As I\nmentioned before, CBDistillery is based out of Colorado, and all of the\nplants that they use to extract their CBD are also grown in Colorado so that's\njust a great thing to keep in mind and you also know you're getting a high\nquality product because they have all these lab tests on their site for each\nof their products. So, you can see the cannabinoid profile, any presence of\npesticides, or anything they've been tested for all that.\nI think one of the main call outs for CB Distillery as a brand is the\naffordability of their products. They're some of the least expensive on the\nmarket but they're not cheaply made they're really high quality so this one\nwhich is a thousand milligram tincture only cost $60 but they also have a ton\nof other products that range in concentration and price point depending\non what you're looking for. So, to finish the unboxing portion of our review we're\njust going to take a look at a couple of the other fun things that CB distillery\nsent us one of which is this 15% off coupon that you can use on any future\norders which is super nice if you end up really liking the brand and you can just\nbuy more products at an even lower cost. And then last but not least, there's this\ncool beanie that they sent us yeah I'm gonna try it on. Might not look great. I\ndon't usually wear hats but I don't know what sound off in the comments below! But\nbe gentle I'm sensitive. So, I would say the main takeaways from CBDistillery as\na brand is that yes, they're super affordable but they're much more than\nthat. They also have a ton of different products that you can choose from and I\nwould say that they're a great brand for beginners because you're not paying a\nlot to try quality products and I would recommend this to anyone that's thinking\nabout giving CBD a try or if you've already been using CBD and you haven't\ntried CBDistillery I'd recommend them as well.", "mpV1-Vv43KM": "[Music] pets help us with our anxiety and cbd helps with theirs basically cbd helps them calm down in situations such as holidays and special occasions when there's fireworks going off and they get very startled also

video for humans you all know that I've been experimenting with CBD for the last couple months because I was looking for a solution to deal with my stress and it's worked out so well for me and I'm so happy that I found a natural solution to my problem and I thought you know why not try it for my dog I have a 12 year old chihuahua chichi and she's been struggling to get around more and more so I wanted something that could alleviate her pain and just you know kind of give her energy boost so I've tried a few different oils from different brands just putting a few drops in her meals twice a day and that's worked really well for her but you should definitely figure out what dosage works best for your dog but first let's explore oil options so here we go my top 5 CBD oils for dogs starting at number five just CBD ok this is number five but honestly it was really hard to order them because they just all worked really well so with just CBD you have quite a few flavor options that can appeal to your pooch they've got bacon chicken salmon and beef I personally went for bacon and I was a little tempted to try it for myself but I didn't so jess CBD offers 3 CBD strengths for their oils and at a pretty good price as well the hundred milligram bottle is at $17.99 the 250 milligrams is at $29.99 and the 500 milligrams is 49.99 Gigi's pretty small so I just went with the hundred milligram bottle and that was enough but if you're looking for the best deals on CBD oils just click on the link in the video description and honestly you'll find the best prices there next in 4th place I put Charlotte's Web there CBD oil is offered as chicken or unflavored this time I went for the unflavored because I figured it would be easier to mix with bigger variety of food again this one worked like a charm just make sure that you test and adjust the dosage when you switch from another CBD provider their oil is also from USA grown hemp and they make it really easy because they only offer two sizes they have the 30 milliliter bottle at $64.99 and at a 100 milliliter bottle for one 59.99 both sizes contains 17 milligrams of CBD and they offer a 30 day satisfaction guaranteed so if you're on the fence you know you can just try it and see if it works with your pooch with little risk in third place we have CBD FX so you might have heard of these guys they've been mentioned by vogue NBC News BuzzFeed etc they provide real high quality products and they also have a huge variety of products they're also 100% natural and organic they use the co2 extraction method and they keep their lab reports available on their websites if you have any concerns and want to have a look so in their pet range they offer three CBD oils and they basically depend on your pet size so for small dog breeds or even just animals weighing less than 20 pounds you have the 150 series at $29.99 for medium breeds there's the 300 series at $44.99 and then for the large breeds there's the 600 series for $69.99 now next on the list and second place med Tara okay first thing to mention about these guys is the price point they're the most affordable and they start at $19.99 for the 150 milligrams bottle you can also get the 300 milligram bottle for $29.99 and the 700 milligram bottle for 39.99 I think 750 is the highest I've seen which you know could be good if you have a mastiff or a Great Dane or something like that like all products in this video matera CBD oil is made in the u.s. non-gmo all natural and doesn't contain any THC which is the psychoactive element of cannabis meaning your dog will not get high and neat little thing that these guys provide also is their pet dosage calculator so you can just scroll here just input the weight of your dog and then you'll get dosage recommendations and if you're out of the u.s. matera ships internationally so you can get your hands on the CBD oil except if you're from Canada or Australia all right now for first place I put honest paws so why did I put these guys in first place well several reasons the first one is these guys only provide CBD oils for pets so that's their main focus second their products are also 100% natural non-gmo from premium grade hemp farmed in Colorado and their soy free so if your dog has soy allergies this is a really good option they also offer the 30-day money-back guarantee their website offers a ton of information on CBD for pets so it's definitely worth a read if you've got any questions or concerns okay now for the main reason why I put on his paws as my first choice is because I had to take a five-hour flight with chichi she is usually a super nervous traveler which in turn makes me super nervous but oh my god what a difference I mean I gave her some CBD before the flight and she was so calm but yet she was you know looking around kind of taking it all in but without like I could tell she was so much more at ease so that's why I put it at number one alright that is it for my

"s4LCzj5l69M": "[Music] have you ever wondered what exactly is meant by the phrase full spectrum cbd oil is there really any difference between a full spectrum product and say another type of cbd product let's take a look let me go ahead and remind new viewers to subscribe to the way of leaf youtube channel we deliver the industry's most accurate and up-to-date information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the topic of what actually full spectrum cbd oil is it's really pretty simple cbd is just one of more than a hundred different compounds naturally found in the cannabis sativa plant a full spectrum cbd oil well contains pretty much all of these compounds a product like cbd isolate oil on the other hand contains just the cbd compound by itself after it's been filtered and fractionated off during the manufacturing process depending on what exactly you're trying to achieve full spectrum cbd oil can actually work better than a cbd isolate in fact research shows that when cannabinoids work together rather than isolated by themselves they're potentially more effective in terms of a therapeutic benefit this phenomenon is known as the entourage effect but we'll talk more about that later as far as what a full spectrum cbd oil actually contains they can include a variety of natural ingredients found in hemp and other types of cannabis these ingredients include things like phytocannabinoids essential vitamins and minerals beneficial fatty acids like omega-3s and omega-6s plant-based protein and fiber chlorophyll terpenes and flavonoids also it's important to understand that full spectrum cbd oil can come from both hemp and marijuana most of the cbd products you see for sale online and in places like gas stations and grocery stores are made from hemp that contains 0.3 thc or less full spectrum cbd oils can also be made from marijuana these oils have higher levels of thc but are only available in dispensaries in states that offer legal medical or recreational cannabis one of the most important studies relating to full spectrum cbd oil took place at the hebrew university of jerusalem in 2015. the study compared the performance of a full spectrum cannabis extract with one that contained cbd only and concluded that at least in mice the full spectrum oil was more effective for pain and inflammation in fact authors of the study claimed the whole plant cannabis extract was ideal for clinical use as compared to isolated cbd another great quote we like to use in order to describe the effectiveness of full spectrum cbd oil comes from dr ethan russo in a 2019 publication in frontiers in plant science dr russo's paper claimed that one molecule i.e cbd is unlikely to match the therapeutic potential of cannabis itself as a phytochemical factory in other words while pure cbd can be effective it appears that full spectrum cbd oil is the better option for therapeutic purposes do you have any more questions about what full spectrum cbd

this is your first hour episode with us welcome today I will be reviewing the entire line of the Pachamama full spectrum CBD tinctures there's six options so there's five flavors and then there's one all-natural flavor all of them full spectrum tinctures I want to point that out so there are the trace amounts of 0.3% of THC nothing higher but those will not induce the intoxicating effects that you get if you smoke you know cannabis you won't get stoned so you don't have to worry about that but I'm very excited to review these Pachamama line of CBD teachers just because of the uniqueness of them there is many many ingredients such as you know goji and cacao kava kava and valerian agencia and green tea you know many of these ingredients have been leveraged for thousands of years in ancient medications so I am excited to review these because I think they will be a perfect pair with a full spectrum hemp extract and really kind of elevate the potential effects because many of these ingredients have really been studied so there's known benefits about these known health benefits associated with it that many of which pair perfectly with the potential benefits of cannabinoids you know such as CBD the trace amounts of THC and many of those minor cannabinoids you know CB and CBD so on and so forth that's present in a full spectrum tincture so let me go ahead and actually walk you guys through the six options of the Pachamama CBD tinctures before actually jumping in and reviewing them oh I do want to point out the Pachamama CBD teachers they're available in 750 milligrams and seventeen hundred and fifty milligrams so one thousand seven hundred fifty milligrams per there milk bottles so very very awesome stick around until the end where I will have I will let you know of an exclusive discount code that you can use on your first purchase of the Pachamama tinctures from wallace e-comm and you know what I'll give you a little hint if you check the description below you can access this exclusive 15% off discount code that you can use at well as c-calm starting right now so let's jump right into the appacha mama line alright so first up we got the goji and cacao mmm alright that's unique some goji berries with cacao so I'm expecting you know a little maybe a notch goji berries with I guess a little bit of a chocolate taste so I mean hey I'm excited about that then next up we got the green tea and agencia okay let's get that party started I mean who doesn't like some green tea at Trent see I'm not really sure how that's gonna taste but hey piqued my interest for sure then next up we got the kava kava and the valerian CBD teacher from Pachamama okay alright and then we got this is a very unique one I mean it makes sense but I mean some of you may be like oh that's interesting is the we got the black pepper and the tumeric tincture from Pachamama okay I'm excited about that see I see I hope you're starting to realize how unique these flavor profiles are these aren't you know for if your user restricting by a product off flavor which I never recommend you should buy it for the effects this maybe not be the line for you because this is for this line is really designed for the all natural health and wellness consumer that doesn't really mind an all-natural taste of many of these ingredients and yeah I think these ingredients are gonna be great tasting they're very unique it's not gonna be like a blueberry or a strawberry or like a fruity cereal that you see you know there's a lot of flavor teachers and even vape juices out there so I want to point that out guys these are very all-natural tasting teachers and you know you should at the end of the day when you're buying a hemp products you should be buying it for the potential effects that you're experiencing not strictly based off the flavor next up number five for Pachamama is the holy basil and yelling laying teacher okay baby here we go and then of course last but not least is the the all-natural patre mama DVD teacher which is just full spectrum hemp extract and MCT oil that's what Pachamama leverages as they're carrying agent in all of their teachers is MCT oil so you know there's only the base ingredients only what's required is what's in there it's all natural ingredients from you guessing mother earth you know Pachamama literally means mother earth so you know like the goji and cacao there's goji berry extract cacao and then there's MCT oil and then full spectrum of extract that's it guys and what's awesome all the ingredients are right on the box and it'll even say i'll walk this through once i get into each product but it even has some potential the effects right on the side of the bottle based off of the ingredients you know because you can't make any health claims around CBD or full spectrum hemp extract at all that is against the law but many of these ingredients have been studied many many times and for years upon years and they have been proven to have these effects so let's go ahead and try our first tincture and all of the teachers i'll be reviewing for Pachamama today will be the 750 milligram version so very excited i mean a very very potent option you know so basically how you figure out how much dope how much CBD you're getting per dropper full is you just do 750 milligrams or the size of the bottle 750 or if you have the 750 milligram bottle then you would just do 750 divided by the size of the bottle and that's how much you get your serving per milliliter and guess what guys that comes to 25 milligrams of CBD per milliliter which is um you know these dropper foals it's a full milliliter so let's go ahead and do the goji and cacao from Pachamama looks really good beautiful packaging very very solid you know it even has right on the side of the on all of the boxes it has a little explanation of the Pachamama hemp like where they source it from what's really awesome is that this that they say you know it's a single origin sourcing it's from it's made with less than 0.3 percent THC which is great It's Made in a cGMP compliant lab non-gmo Fairtrade triple lab tested very key all naturally sourced ingredients and it's all made in the USA with ingredients sourced from around the world you know goji berry extract cacao and then right on the side of the cacao box it says it's got focus because let me actually walk you through before I actually get into actually tasting the goji in cacao you know so what are some of the potential benefits of you know goji cacao you know goji has really high nutritional value it's an excellent source of vitamins it's high in antioxidants very very key provides immune system report of support you know if you're feeling sick this should be a great king sure to leverage and it promotes healthy skin you know goji berries contain beta-carotene which is great you know for skin health and last but not least about goji that I really wanted to touch on is it first uses were recorded you know in the year about 250 BC so like I said guys these ingredients have been leveraged for a very very long time and then you know then we got the the cacao cacao I mean you know let's kind of get a give you like the the chocolate chocolatey taste you know this is rich in minerals high in antioxidants 40 times the antioxidants of blueberries we all know how much we've been told by our doctors to eat these blueberries because of their antioxidant benefits and it's a natural mood enhancer and antidepressant very very good seat pairs perfectly with those potential benefits of cannabinoids it supports energy production sparks libido oddly yeah in case you're looking for that and it can also help relieve stress so you know all of those sort of effects and benefits that you're experiencing from the goji in cacao many of those are the potential benefits you experience with CBD and cannabinoids so that's what I'm talking about guys Pancho I really took their teacher line to the next level by pairing these ingredients with these Kanab with a full spectrum HEPA extract which i think is just a brilliant idea so I applaud you guys on that nicely done Pachamama you guys um I mean I just I love your products I love your product lines so let's do it I'm I just want to point this out just like with all my review videos I'm honest I don't get paid by Pachamama at all to do these videos so I just want to point that out again beautiful packaging so shake it up as always boom child-resistant cap and what's awesome look at that that nice golden hemp extract look it beautiful and what's awesome is right on the droppers right on the t-shirts they're actually labeled so there's one male point seven-five half mil and a quarter of a mil so you know precisely how much CBD you're getting every single time you dose yourself out so let's go ahead and there's sublingual delivery do not vape these lift your tongue and drop the oil right under your tongue let sit there for 30 to 60 seconds you know mmm wow that is taste like chocolate mm-hmm ooh all-natural taste you know I do get right when I drop that teacher the God you can accounting sure right into my mouth I do immediately start getting a I start tasting that cacao you know the chocolate the all natural source of chocolate you guys guessed it I like that and then as I swallow it I do get like the aftertaste is obviously chocolatey but I am really getting sort of a faint kind of caged I believe what would be the goji berries I mean I've never actually personally eaten goji berries so I'm not sure what they exactly taste like but I feel like I am getting a residual sort of berry taste out of the goji and cacao um so you know it's I like that I like that sort of chocolatey taste that is along with it and then the sort of berry taste kind of rounds out the flavor um you know as I always like to give flavor rating just so you guys know but at the end of day should not be buying a product strictly off of flavor and plus guys flavor is very very subjective so if I had to rate the goji and cacao on a scale of one to ten hmm that chocolates still linger in my mouth I do like that a lot I would have to give that a seven point five out of ten so actually a very solid score I'm impressed by that then next up in the review today we got the green tea and echinacea full spectrum hemp extract tincture from my good friends over at Pachamama CBD look at this bad boy you know it's just looking at this the branding of this you know it just feels like I'm about to you know eat like a green or drink a green tea smoothie earth or something you know but before just like with the goji and cacao it will walk you through some of the benefits that you experience with the green tea and echinacea you know for the echinacea for example it's great for reducing inflammation it supports and improves your immune system health which we can all benefit from next up we it can help treat health ailments and illnesses which I mean hey you can't argue with that whoo why wouldn't you want to take something that can potentially help with that and it also helps to aid in healthy cell growth and helps manage anxiety guys helps manage anxiety anxiety it makes sense while the echinacea is inside of this tincture with the full spectrum hemp extract because I mean many many people use full-spectrum hemp backstrap broad-spectrum or CBD in general for its potential anti-anxiety effects you know we live in an anxious world nowadays guys so it's that it makes sense why CBDs one of the largest use cases of cannabinoids is for you know anti-anxiety then for the green tea benefits we counted touch on that I mean I'm sure many of you do know of the green tea benefits could green teas all over the place but some of the best benefits are its anti-aging properties it's rich and anti-aging antioxidants you know that such as the EGCG which is a poly phenyl that actually increases cell turnover to fight those wrinkles guys RIT and it's rich in these polyphenols which are micronutrients that are packed with antioxidants and other many health benefits it provides metabolic support cellular support strong antioxidant properties okay and it can also help to improve brain function so I know I don't I take CDs just for it it's Jenn CBD excuse me general wellness benefits I don't have any diseases they're ailments but one of the largest use cases for me is my focus and concentration that's what I've noticed that really really helps me so the fact that having this green tea teacher from Pachamama and knowing that the green tea can help to improve brain brain function I it's just a match made in heaven in my honest opinion so let's try the green tea and echinacea full spectrum teen chef from Pachamama again beautiful packaging right on it let me take a look at this real quick Oh yep perfect they got the QR code right on the label so you can scan it for the third-party test results then they even make it super easy and let you know how much of like the green tea and echinacea and plus the hemp extract how much you are getting per dose which is very very crucial guys there's a lot of companies other than that that really make dosing very confusing for you guys as the end consumer and what's really awesome right at the bottom there's a sticker if you guys can see this but it's batch tested which is a win in my book you know there's no there's no regulations in the the hemp space yet so I just like here at Wallace II we regulate ourselves in an unregulated industry and Pachamama is following suit as well so I do applaud you guys on that there's just simply not enough companies that are regulating themselves you know and just trying to hide things from the in consumer which is not OK in my honest opinion so green tea and echinacea tincture for Pachamama boom look at that okay ooh I mean honestly like it just smells like a natural full spectrum had that extract like that's what it smells like so all right let's go hmm okay now I wonder a little different I do it does kind of feel like I have like green tea leaves kind of in my mouth but I mean that's kind of what to be expected it's natural so it honestly just tastes like for me it's like it's not very overpowering but it's very I taste the natural hemp extract you know but I just feel like I kind of just have sort of some like green tea leaves like I was kind of just like it's almost like I was sucking on like a really small small bag of like green tea leaves you know like kind of like a snus pouch you know for like true like if I had like a snooze pouch of like green tea leaves in there and I just like had it in my lip like it's very faint like it it honestly isn't a like it just more than anything it does kind of just remind me of like having faint a green tea taste in it with um you know the full spectrum hemp extract so I am a fan of it it's very very faint it's not like you don't put in your mouth at you're not like uh it's a great solid flavor all around I mean it's not like flavorful to the max but the great Teaneck Anisha teacher I mean it really doesn't taste like much I mean I taste the green tea though faintly but I mean like echinacea it's you know it's sort of like a flower and so it's not I was expecting maybe a little more floral taste which I mean I guess maybe that's a good thing they kind of muted it a little bit but I understand just take the taste the all-natural full spectrum hemp extract with the faint sort of green tea leaves that I that I was describing uh a few minutes ago but I I like it I mean the goat cheese cacao I feel like I like to go Jade cacao a little bit more just because I did like that cacao and that sort of chocolatey berry taste and I rated the goji cow seven point five out of ten on the flavor scale the green tea and echinacea I got it just because it was kind of lacking in flavor for me if I had to just strictly base it off flavor and I'll touch on the effects on everything later on in the review video towards the end but I mean I'm gonna give that a six point five out of ten on the flavor rating so it's not horrible but I mean like like I enjoyed it like I'm just basing it strictly off of flavor but I liked using it it was it just tasted like an actual full spectrum hemp extract and I like natural flavors so you may or may not so just keep that in mind next up we the kava kava and valerian root full-spectrum extract t-shirt from Pachamama so kava kava and valerian here's the cute little box I you know let's just call it cute just has got that nice little pink you know it's got some of the the benefits for the kava kava just read on the box and valerian is for relaxation so you know if you're looking to relax you know reach for this kava kava and the the valerian you know whereas the goji like the goji in cacao you know that was for focus and then the green tea and echinacea that was for recovery so now if you're looking to relax and chill after a long day you know who doesn't like to do that reach for this kava kava valerian so what are some of the potential or the benefits that have been associated with let's say kava kava you know it promotes tranquility it promotes muscle relaxation aids and feelings of anxiety so combat some of those things those anxious feelings that we're always talking about and aids and feelings of restlessness so the relaxation benefits can really help you know so you're not having that anxiety when you're laying in bed and then you could really reduce that restlessness so then you can actually go to sleep at night because guess what guys sleep is very very important if you don't sleep and your whole entire life begins to just go downhill next up we got the valerian root so what are some of those benefits associated with well valerian you know it promotes relaxation has calming benefits anti stress benefits aids and feelings of sleepiness and promotes hi-hi promotes a better quality sleep so as you can see guys up makes sense why Pachamama paired the kava kava valerian root with a full spectrum hemp extract could provide those relaxation benefits alright let's go ahead and now taste the kava kava and valerian again beautiful packaging 750 milligrams pop this box open here we go and guys every time you go to use as teacher or even an oil anytime you a full spectrum HEPA extract oil or a CBD ISIL oil broad spectrum oil you should always before you use it just just to do it just shake it up you know mix up all the ingredients and everything so there's no separation or anything so I always just sit here and kind of shake it kind of quickly you know just and then you're good to go all right beautiful beautiful bottle as always and then so and now it's also got the batch testing so sorry guys I'm kind of just looking at the label the levels really beautiful all the information you really need from this product is read on the label so if I rating the Pachamama tincture labels 1 to 10 I give them a 10 at a 10 it's very very solid everything you need is right on it they're not hiding anything from you so I applaud you on that Pachamama alright kava-kava valerian look at this oops alright so there's a full mill let me make sure you get a full mill in there oh look at that golden goodness that's how you want your full spectrum extract you know a little maybe a little bit darker maybe a little sort of a brown gold or a gold like this that's what you want that's how you know it's a high quality full spectrum hemp extract all right now look John mm-hmm okay I mean many of you guys have maybe leave a comment if you take cava cava or valerian or any of these ingredients kind of on their own on the side let me know what you take it for and some of the benefits you've experienced so I'm talking my mouth full but huh that one was very very like a natural taste with it you know the kava kava and the valerian valerian root I mean I've actually tried kava kava before and that's definitely what I taste out of it I mean like kava kava taste very very natural and earthy I don't know if any of you ever had like a kava kava tea but that it just it tastes just like kava kava in my opinion it's just a it's just a natural earthy sort of tasting a sort of an ingredient that goes in there but it's not I mean I like the kava kava valerian Pachamama teacher better than just drinking kava kava tea that I can't do that I was like but it was too much for me but I feel like it's very toned down and it's a nice mixture and I think just having like those terpenes of the full spectrum headaches fragmented with the MCT oil and then you know just that terpenes in that hemp and that full spectrum hand back stroke I really think they kind of just blend nicely together and you know at the end of the day Pachamama just their overall formulation of these products is very very solid you know it's not like you know if you eat some like kava kava for example and you were to just like dump it in your mouth they're like drink a tea where you'd be like it they just really I obviously they did a ton of our I need to make sure these formulations were perfect so it doesn't make you gag but at the same time you still know when she dropped in your mouth like okay this is a very natural teacher that I am taking right now and I can definitely taste these ingredients so if I had to you know rate the pot or the kava kava and the valerian tincture on us just based off the flavor you know of effects are most important I got to keep saying that guys I you know I think I do like that one I mean I still got to put that with the green tea and agencia I'm gonna put that at a 6.5 as well you know I mean I'm not you know it's not like I haven't had any of the three teachers I've tried they're not making me gag I'm not like well you know spitting it out I'm able to need you know put in my mouth swallow and as you can see I'm not I'm not even washing it down with water because I just want to show you I mean you could certainly do that if or even coffee you know either ooh that goji and cacao would be really good mixing and coffee side no and you want to point that out but you know just you can always rinse it down with some a liquid or something but I mean at the end of the day in my opinion I don't think the flavors are too you know they're not gag-worthy in my opinion right now number four the fourth teacher from the Pachamama line full spectrum have extra teachers on if reviewing today that I love is going to be the black pepper and the tumeric so here's a quick little look you know it's got the hem and the black pepper and tumeric box right on the side it says this is intended for you know some detox benefits so let's go ahead and discuss some of the potato and tumeric so let's first start out with black pepper you know it's a bio enhancer which you know this means that it increases bioavailability of turmeric anti-inflammatory compounds plus with that black pepper can help to increase you know that bioavailability of the cannabinoids you know the bioavailability that's crucial when you're taking a a hemp extract product as CBD isolate broad-spectrum whatever you're taking bioavailability is key you know it varies from consumption method to consumption method you know whether you're using a teacher edible capsule vape juice they all have very bioavailability so violet bioavailability if you aren't aware is the amount of CBD that is actually delivered into your body you know CBD and other cannabinoids that's actually delivered into your body after going through and being processed their internal bodily rate system so you know after being digested after being processed by you know either you're inside of your body which then delivers it into your bloodstream so bioavailability is key you know typically you know edibles capsules have a lower by a bioavailability and then teachers and vape juice are more higher up on the spectrum so some other benefits of black pepper of course is a it's a CB 2 which is cannabinoid receptor number 2 receptor agonist very very crucial and it contains the first the world's first bio enhancer piperine interesting enough now some of the tumeric benefits is it's rich in poly phenols which we talked about a little earlier which you know these are micronutrients that are packed with antioxidants and many other health benefits and turmeric can help improve digestion it aids an oxidative stress which you know this occurs naturally and plays a role in the overall aging process and this can actually be harmful to your body if you know you have extensive oxidative stress and then also turmeric helps to you know support inflammation just like cannabinoids such as CBD and you know some of the minor cannabinoids very very crucial and it has antimicrobial and anti oxidant properties that improve skin health so guys many of these things have been used you need detox it makes sense you're detoxing your body the oxidative stress you're detoxing all those harmful chemical all those harmful things inside of your body so it makes sense for these black pepper tumeric all right yeah the black pepper and turmeric are paired together with a full spectrum hemp extract who I am starting to feel very very good like I just feel like my overall alertness I just like as I was talking I just say kind of just like all that all hit me by storm at once because I mean I've been doing a milliliter of each of these 750 milligrams teamsters I've been taken I mean 25 milligrams 50s at 75 milligrams of a hemp extract that I've taken you know CBD inside of my body so I am ver my overall alertness verbal fluency focus concentration I feel good right now and just my general wellness I feel very very high the edges I'm very content in life right now so and it just it's easy to feel that way because I mean it when you're taking a high-quality HEPA extract product it of course you're gonna I mean I can't guarantee any effects but when I know the way my I react to taking CBD and I just know that I I can feel it and when I take a high quality product such as for Pachamama I I know I'm in for I know some of the effects that I can begin to expect so now we got let's go ahead and jump right into the black pepper and tumeric here we go guys look at that nice little label I like to show you guys this batch testing right at the bottom and you know they got the CRC caps of child resistant caps and they also come with those little shrink wraps that I kind of just don't really I don't really rip off I can just twist them all off but look golden goodness black pepper tumeric let's see hmm I mean all of them really do do smell like that all natural hemp extract but I mean maybe faint like tumeric or maybe maybe a little bit of tumeric a black pepper but I mean let's see I'm keep I'm interested to see how this tastes here we go whoa definitely contains that black pepper once you initially drop it and I taste the full spectrum hemp ex-truck right and then the black pepper starts to come out and as it sits in there the tumeric starts to come out but it's not like it's not like you were to pour black pepper into your hand and just putting your mouth you know that probably make you cough sneeze and no it doesn't taste like that and then same with tumeric you know it's not overpowering like you were to just eat like a handful of tumeric it's good it's I I'm surprised I thought the black pepper into work might be with the one that was like they threw me off but I like that a lot like it's very subtle though like I could see like you know that black pepper and turmeric if you're making like some spaghetti or something you know like a meal at home you could like mix that in with your food anyway I think it would just like enhance the overall flavors you know if you're cooking with black pepper and turmeric I feel like this black pepper and turmeric teacher would be a phenomenal additive into your food or whatever whatever your main I mean obviously food but I feel like whether you're making like a sort of like a gravy or like a dressing or you know pasta or something that would be a great additive I like that I'm surprised I'm saying this I like the black pepper in Toomer more than the kava-kava and the green tea and at Trent and the green tea I like that one better I mean I rated both those you know 6.5 so I mean the goji cacao that's still my favorite I mean the black pepper and turmeric I got to give that a 7 out of 10 on the flavor rating alright so the last flavor teacher from the Pachamama line is I mean of course you got two more but that's natural is the yel ylang-ylang and holy basil okay and you know right on the box it says right here these us if you're looking for some creativity boosting effects you know that's what the holy basil and yeah Lang Lang teachers for you know it's for that creativity helps stimulate your brain and help you really you know if you're at work that's where I could see this works cool let's do or you know at home when you're doing your side house or whatever you're doing reach for that yeah ylang-ylang and holy basil teacher from Pachamama so what are some of the benefits of y'all angling well I'm glad you all us it can reduce stress it promotes relaxation throughout the body and your mind okay I need some of that improve skin and hair health all right I mean the skin health out here I live in Colorado so I as hell so okay I'm getting behind that has anti-inflammatory properties and it's popular in traditional Chinese medicine now what are some of the potential benefits of holy basil I'm sure you guys basil you know probably cook with basil or have in the past so you're familiar with it so now what are some of the benefits of holy basil you know basil you cook with it you're familiar with it I'm sure I you know it helps your body to adapt to stress okay we live in a stressful world so we can all use some of that it can take hundreds of phytochemicals that have proven to be beneficial for human health all right and it helps maintain homeostasis you know balance equilibrium throughout your body that is what happens that's why you feel you know that's how CBD and cannabinoids can be so effective because it works with your endocannabinoid system it stimulates your endocannabinoid system works with those cb1 and cb2 receptors provides relief where you need it because your endo cannabinoid system is in charge of many important bodily regulations so once you take it it helps to promote homeostasis you know cannabinoids do that it helps promote homeostasis so it's even better that holy basil can help to promote homeostasis as well throughout your body you want balance and equilibrium in your body and holy basil can also protect your body from toxins and infections um what what else are some of the benefits you know it's high in vitamins A C as well as calcium and zinc and last but not least some of the most important benefits of holy basil are its antioxidant antiviral antibacterial and mewn enhancing benefits you know as you guys are starting to realize like hope many of these ingredients also play off the backs of the potential effects of cannabinoids such as CBD so it's just all of these ingredients are a match made in heaven you know Pachamama didn't just like randomly like oh we're just gonna throw these all-natural ingredients in here just for the hell of it you know they did not do that they did it because they were calculated they did their research and they want to do it to make sure that you guys at the end consumer have the best possible product with the best possible effects so let's go ahead and do the you ylang-ylang holy basil ii you know the creativity boosting effects I like that um you know I honestly am thinking that like it's gonna taste like some like basil that's what I'm that's not feeling alright so I you know I'm expecting that the you know the legal angling is going to you know taste like what am i what should I say I'm like basil I mean obviously it's got basil but also I mean some of the yelling like I don't know if you've ever tried your ylang ylang but it's sort of like like I guess the taste could be you know compared to like a honeydew and sweet complex enough to stand out on its own you know kind of like a honey sweetness flavor maybe I mean it's honestly I mean a lot of people like compared to like you know your ylang ylang should be like the new vanilla like a new sort of additive it like it's a sweetness kind of thing so let's see how the Elaine going taste with the basil whoa it's smell this one shows a little differently I can smell the basil but like the your ylang ylang I think that's like the sweetness and I'm getting all right one full milliliter beauty-full left the time hmm all right basil all the way but it's sweet that's the you ylang-ylang mmm so you know Lang Lang's like a sweet flavor kind of um basil we all know a bit you know you're familiar basil mmm you taste like basil a sweet basil honestly see I'm kind of impressed by how much I like that flavor like wow it's sweet and then it's got the basil to flag I didn't think those would pair well together but surprisingly enough they do and I mean if you're cooking with bass I mean you know that you're angling and basil mix together but I mean even if you're like making tea or something else I mean I would just I like these just right under the tongue Wow it's sweet sort of like I guess sort of like honey air like yeah it's a little sweetness of honey I guess you could look compared to with the taste of basil perfect paired it's not like too much basil it's I like that a lot you know flavor scales had to rate that out of a scale of one to ten you know I Nana I actually do like that it's up there with a go gene cacao with me so I got to give that a 7 point 5 out of 10 boom here we go so that is it for you know the flavoured options of the Pachamama line of full spectrum have extract tinctures but you know there is one more option there is if you don't like any of those I mean I would recommend trying them at least you know especially because of all those incredible ingredients that they got in there I would recommend you know if you want if you just want an all-natural option Pachamama has an all-natural option because guess what you know what's in here full spectrum have backtrack and MCT oil that is it it's no no additives nothing so this one I mean I'm not really gonna be able to do flavor because I mean it's all natural it doesn't taste like it just tastes like full spectrum hemp extract but you know I do want to use it just to you know finalize the review so I can say you know I did all of my shake it up here we go and the natural guess what MCT oil all natural hemp extract boom there we go beautiful all right boom I love it I enjoy all natural tinctures it's just I love the taste of hemp extract I liked terpenes you know those naturally-occurring terpenes I don't think there needs to be flavor I get it while some of you do want it that's why you know like it well c-calm our full spectrum tincture we have a chocolate mint that people love but i enjoy the natural so just like with ours the pocket our mom and natural phenomenal it doesn't make me again very easy to use boom it's dropped in on my tongue held it there so all it you know and the natural you know this should be really good you know if you're making like salad dressings if you want to mix it infuse it into things that's when the natural would come into play but i mean you could be making a spaghetti sauce and mix that in there if you want or even the yelling of basil you know so start thinking of it like that you can use this as tinctures but you can also cook with these you know or mix it with beverages I mean might be a little far of a stretch to make sure the beverage unless like the green tea and the echinacea that would be good you know your drink green tea mix it like that so just think of it like that but you know overall the Pachamama line of full-spectrum tinctures are incredible you know like so for example let's walk through my ratings on the flavor you know the goji cacao that was a seven point five out of ten you know the green tea and echinacea that was a six point five out of ten the kava kava and valerian that was a six point five out of ten the black pepper and tumeric that's going higher that was a seven out of ten you know the ylang ylang and holy basil I give I gave that a seven point five out of ten and you know the natural I can't really it's just a natural hemp extract so I can't really just say the flavor but overall very very solid but again guys the Pachamama did not set out to make the you know the best tasting teachers they made they set out to make the most effect give tinctures that have the greatest potential to work for you and your personal needs and I think they achieved that goal especially because they're available in 750 milligrams and 1750 milligrams at CBD per a 30 ml bottle hey guys I did want to jump back in here you know it's been about 45 minutes since I started taking the Pachamama CBD tinctures and let me tell you so I take CBD cannabinoid you know full-spectrum have an extract isolate broad-spectrum for the general health and wellness benefits because I'm lucky enough where I don't have any you know illnesses or you know ailments that are really kind of deterring me from function in my day-to-day life you know I'm not I don't have a disease or anything so I just take it for the general health and wellness benefits and the sort of the mind inducing effects like the mind boosting effects I guess I should say of cannabinoids and let me tell you so here's what I'm really experiencing right now is my general wellness health and well-being I just feel fantastic like I'm just happy I have a positive outlook on life and I'm just I just I feel good I'm I'm happy right now my verbal fluency is on point I really feel it if you guys you guys would probably start telling throughout the review video that I feel like I can just start talking and talking and talking and just the words there's no delay from my thought process to my mouth it kind of just flows so that verbal fluency is on point and then my focus and my concentration levels are really really there and that's what I become to expect when I'm taking a quality hemp extract product because like I said I take it for the general health and wellness benefits and those are the things that I really look for and that is exactly what I have noticed since taking the Pachamama CBD teaches and I feel very relaxed and just chill I'm just I'm happy in life I'm content you know and I just feel like you know what while I was kind of sitting we know waiting for the full effects of everything to kick in and for tea know where to start stimulating my endocannabinoids system I did pause this video so that I could come back and film this but I did start to notice that my mind was starting to really wander and ideas were really starting to generate in my brain so I feel like that's the cannabinoids starting to work and you know help with that you know the the sort of the mind effect so that's I'm really noticing that because especially like you know the holy basil in you ylang ylang like did mention that that does have sort of those creativity boosting effects so that's where I think that's coming from and honestly guys I feel like I need to stay here and talk with you all day and I just I feel great so the overall effects that I'm getting and the improvements in just what I'm feeling right now this is knowing me guaranteeing or expressing that you will feel the same way or anything at at that but right now the effects that I'm experiencing after reviewing the entire line of Pachamama CBD products I gotta give it a 10 a 10 10 it's a very solid line of products very unique and just the ingredients in there are just top-notch so nicely done 10 out of 10 guys so that's you know I mean hey you can't argue with the results that I'm experiencing but who knows what you'll experience maybe it'll be less maybe

It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "Ig6wsfxfNv8": "hey guys Dallas Norton with pure spectrum here today I'm going to be telling you all about how to use our hemp oil tincture our tincture comes in two different strengths a normal strength and an extra strength normal strength comes in a 15 milliliter and 30 milliliters serving size extra strength comes in a 30 milliliter and 60-million or serving size our THC free hump oil contains the full spectrum whole plant profiles including terpenes omegas flavonoids and other trace vital cannabinoids it's infused with an organic MCT oil and boosted with our pure CBD isolate finally third-party testing ensures purity and potency there are several ways to use our hemp oil tincture the most common way and the one that we recommend the most is doing this sublingually by placing the full serving dropper underneath your tongue holding it there for at least 30 seconds to let it absorb and then swallowing the rest down our tincture works best when taken consistently we recommend taking one to two servings daily and the time depends on your name", "Gkw27wXh0W0": "Are you interested in buying CBD for\nyour pet and need a little help on where to start?\nGreat! This comprehensive video will walk you through the ins and outs of\npurchasing CBD for dogs and cats. We'll quickly review what CBD is, how its\nmanufactured, what it's used for, what you should be looking for when you decide to\npurchase, and where to safely buy quality CBD with confidence. We hope you\nenjoy! So, now let's quickly discuss CBD and CBD\noil. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a powerful cannabinoid derived from the\ncannabis plant which has been used for medical and therapeutic reasons for\nthousands of years. The extraction process of CBD from the cannabis plant involves\nusing a solvent, such as carbon dioxide, to pull the element from the plant. Then\nthe CBD is infused with a carrier oil such as hemp seed oil. Popular reasons\nfor using CBD for pets include; fighting both chronic and acute diseases in pets\nsuch as arthritis and autoimmune disorders like allergies, immune system\nfailures, and cancer. CBD has also been found to have incredible results in\nmanaging pain, anxiety, neurological disorders, stimulation of appetite,\nepilepsy, and the reduction of muscle spasms. You may hear different\nterminology when it comes to CBD. You might have heard or read the following\nphrases like full spectrum, broad spectrum, and isolate. It's important to\nrecognize the differences in each one. Full spectrum CBD, also known as whole\nplant CBD, includes all of the hemp plants naturally occurring cannabinoids,\nterpenes, and flavonoids. This form of CBD also includes very low levels of THC. THC\nis a cannabinoid which gives the users that high feeling. However, the amount of\nTHC in hemp derived CBD is under 0.3% which is not enough to get you or your\npet high. Broad-spectrum CBD is very similar to full-spectrum CBD but with\none key difference. Broad-spectrum CBD contains absolutely no THC. Aside from\nthat, broad spectrum CBD includes all of the other cannabinoids and terpenes just like it's full-spectrum counterpart. In 2015, a study was done by the\nLautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology. It was determined that\nfull-spectrum CBD extract has a greater anti-inflammatory effect than CBD isolate\nalone and was more favorable in usage overall\nthat's compared to broad-spectrum CBD. CBD isolate is cannabidiol in its purest\nform. The CBD is thoroughly isolated from all of the cannabinoids and terpenoids.\nCBD isolate is made by refining raw CBD extract down to its molecular level, leaving behind\nonly the CBD molecule itself. So, now let's cover the different CBD pet\nproducts and what to look for when making a purchase.\nCBD pet tinctures also known as CBD oil, comes in the small glass bottle filled\nwith highly concentrated CBD. The glass bottle will usually include a dropper\nwhich makes it easy to administer the oil. You can drop CBD oil in food, water,\nor directly into your pets mouth. Remember that purchasing full-spectrum\nCBD oil is preferred as it will allow your pet to experience the full benefits\nthat hemp has to offer. Second, check the ingredient labels to\nsee the types of oil in the tincture. Coconut oil and hemp seed oil are two of\nthe most commonly used. Hemp seed oil is a great option as it includes a high\nconcentration of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which promote healthy skin\nand coat for your pet. Finally, look for CBD oil that is organic, grain free, and\nnon-gmo. As pet owners it's our responsibility to make sure our pets are\nreceiving the highest quality products possible.\nIn addition, choosing a CBD product that is manufactured in the US is strongly\nrecommended. Avoiding non-regulated and questionable supplements from overseas\nis crucial. CBD pet capsules are another easy and effective way to administer CBD\nto your dog or cat. You can hide the capsules in their snacks or split them\nopen and mix them in your pets favorite food or water. When considering the\ncapsule option, look for organic, grain free, and non-GMO capsules, as most\ncapsules sold in stores contain animal gelatin as an ingredient. For a healthier\noption look for a plant-based or vegan capsules. CBD treats are a great option\nfor dogs that have problem taking pills or tincture drops. These dog treats are\nalready infused with CBD oil so there's no need for mixed\nor any other additional work. Our holistic pet CBD dog treats come in\nthree yummy flavors each with a different formula for your pet's a\nspecific condition. Our treats are all-natural and only contain non-GMO\ningredients. They never include artificial colors flavors or\npreservatives. Furthermore, they're all gluten-free grain free and dairy free\nmaking them a smart choice for health-conscious pet owners. Topicals are\nideal for pets who are either suffering from serious joint and body pains or\nskin allergies. You can apply them directly to your pets skin to deliver\nimmediate relief. The topical is only for external use so make sure that your pet\ndoesn't ingest it. With the recent CBD boom it seems that there are hundreds of\nbrands out there selling CBD products for pets making it very hard to\ndetermine who to trust. The first thing to look out for is the source of the CBD.\nWhile there aren't countless numbers of hemp farms in the United States, all hemp\nhas not grown to the same standard and caliber. In order to cut costs and\nincrease production, many suppliers of CBD grow their hemp farms using\nartificial fertilizers pesticides and chemicals that are very toxic for your\npet.

while back I made a video about my extremely shy cat Kate Moss who was so skittish that she runs under the bed when anyone walks into the room now Katie's been with me since she was a tiny feral kitten but while the rest of her litter were all quickly socialized she just never got over her intense shyness katie spends most of her time on or under the bed in our guest room but she loves to eat and so she'll usually venture out when it's dinnertime just to make sure she's not forgotten sometimes she'll allow one of us to pet her but after a moment she quickly bolts away it's like she'll forget for a few seconds to be scared but then it always comes right back I think Katie does want affection but she has a very strong fear reflex which is something all cats instinctually have as a survival mechanism Katie is now almost 15 years old and while age has mellowed her some she's still very shy she has a great life she gets along well with the other cats but I've always felt bad that she's just so nervous I recently read about the use of CBD oil being used to help calm nervous cats so I thought I'd give it a try and see if it might help Kate Moss now what exactly is CBD oil well it's an oil made from the flowers and leaves of the hemp plant which is a cousin of the marijuana plant unlike marijuana hemp lacks the THC compound that makes you stoned but it does have other compounds called phytochemicals which some have claimed can heal all kinds of ailments from depression to inflammation to even epilepsy I even take it myself sometimes when I'm feeling like I need to relax a little and it does help but whether this supposed miracle oil would make any difference in Katie's anxiety would to be seen I decided to try two different brands of CBD oil formulated for cats this one by pet relief and this one by Bluebird each dose contains about three to four percent CBD oil and it can be mixed into the cats food the oil has a pretty strong herbal smell that some cats might not like but Katy never a picky eater scarped it down without hesitation Katy received a morning dose of the pet relief oil for two weeks and then I switched to the blue bird oil for the next two weeks I figured a month would be sufficient time for any therapeutic effects of the CBD oil to take place and so did the CBD oil turn my achingly shy Wallflower Kitty into a high struttin attention seeking party cat well not quite but here's my observations I do think katie has been more relaxed and she's not hiding as much under the bed I've even caught her cuddling with singsing on a chilly morning and she's ventured out to other areas of the house which we'd rarely seen her do before as for her interactions with us I think she's a little bit more tolerant of being petted there was a point a while ago and Katy wouldn't even come out from the guest room and we'd even have to take her dinner to her now she's usually right under my feet meowing the whole time when I'm preparing food in addition to the increased relaxation I've also noticed some positive physical changes since Katy started taking the oil such as the improvement in her fur which has always been a little rough and scraggly probably because she won't allow me to brush her after a month of the CBD oil her coat looks thicker and more lustrous though I really wish she'd let me comb out some of that loose fur the CBD has a coconut oil base and it also contains antioxidants which can contribute to skin and code health so what are my conclusions after Kate Moss's month of CBD oil well while I think it's helped to take an edge off her nervousness she's still a very shy skittish cat and won't allow us to get too much closer to her than she did before but I do think she's calmer and happier in her daily lightning and she's interacting more with our other cats so for now I will continue giving Katie the CBD oil but these oils are not cheap they run between 30 and 70 dollars per bottle so I'm only going to use them if I continue to see benefits while CBD oil has shown promise in some studies it is not an FDA regulated supplement and Moore's research is needed to confirm its effectiveness there is a lot of hype out there for pet supplements which generate billions of dollars and sales so I can be kind of skeptical about miracle oils or herbs when there's just not a lot of scientific study to back up the big claims there's also a lot of low quality CBD oils that are being sold and contain few of the beneficial compounds at all so be sure to buy from a reputable CBD company it won't hurt to try CBD oil for your anxious cat and perhaps it really can help but you know your cat better than anyone and if you don't see any results after a month of giving it I say don't waste your money thanks

products say that it helps them with general stress anxiety they sleep better if they work out at the gym all the time it helps with inflammation and just provides an overall well-being so when and how do most people use full spectrum hemp the most common form is oil otherwise known as extract or tinctures at minted leaf we use a thirty milliliter dropper bottle which makes it super easy to get the exact same amount every day make sure to give your bottle a little shake before you use and place one full dropper amount underneath your tongue and hold it for sixty seconds and then swallow it actually has a mild mint flavor which is refreshing some people like to add it to their favorite hot beverage like tea or coffee for any supplement to work properly you want to make sure you're using it on a daily basis you want to build it into your routine I like to take mine at the same time every day missing days or not using the right dosage it's gonna mean that you're not going to have the amazing benefits so now it's time to get a little personal so a few years ago I underwent a spinal fusion surgery I mean I was dealing with daily pain in my neck my jaw headaches I mean I couldn't sleep it was causing anxiety and stress it was just awful and I tried everything from massage therapy injections physical therapy acupuncture pain pills I mean that he wants to have to take pain pills right so to be honest before I started with minted leaf I hadn't heard of full spectrum hemp or specifically using it to help aid pain so of course when I started I was like live to try this and I'm a bit skeptical and really in full transparency I didn't feel like it works for me the first couple of days because I was using too low of a dose so I upped my dose and I upped it twice a day and now I feel really great I can tell you what it does for me it makes my competing muscles just feel more relaxed so I'm not gonna say that the pain is a hundred percent gone but I just feel better it also helps with things like just focus and clarity throughout the day again I put it in my tea at night it's a great way to just relax before you sleep and like a little hint for my crazy active

"8cAHF-AL8rs": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back to tea gardens TV today i have a special product that i want to share with you all we've been getting a lot of questions about this here at the shop and i figured a million of you out there will probably curious about it as well we're gonna talk about the hemp green leaf CBD product is Nick come on in guys all right everybody let's dive straight into these products here so we're doing two review today on the green leaf hemp oils here okay there's no difference between heavy oil or CBD oil it technically means the same thing I just think it's slinking purposes okay I mean this really we're gonna tackle three things today it's gonna be the difference between isolates and and full-spectrum hot into how to divide into your dosages how to actually dose your dosages properly okay in a different basis that they offer widows VG base or water base or even PG base okay how they're all used alright so the first thing we're the tackle is isolating and full-spectrum here you can see on these bottles it says isolates and in the red labels as a full spectrum what is the difference difference is full spectral I mean isolate means pure CBD it's been through an additional process to remove all the other cannabinoids okay all the other like THC and all that jazz and it's only just pure CBDs okay I generally always ask people before selling it here do you know does your job test and and if they do go with the isolates do any pop up tez or any drug test in that nature always use the isolates it's gonna be safest when it comes to you know just in case you get that even though in California or whatever state you're at the legal limit is 0.03 percent out here in California if you take the full spectrum and you take enough of it you might store you know your fat cells might hold enough THC where you get pop of the test so just on the safest side isolate means pure CBD there shouldn't be any THC at all okay now full spectrum means all cannabinoids from from the plant okay now like I said the legal limit in CBD here that's not sold and any collectives or dispensary is supposed to be 0.03 percent why did why don't you some people hear that it's better to take THC with a little bit of THC with your CBDs okay because they do work in conjunction somehow now CBD here doesn't have any THC in it I've taken this before I feel like it's about the same I mean such a low low dosage of THC may not make a massive difference or I mean very little difference at all because it's 0.03 percent member is not 0.3% its 0.03 percent okay how do we dose this the best way to dosage dose this CBD here is now generally always tell people 15 milligrams is kind of like the dosage where you can feel the CBD enough for you to feel the relaxation okay if you take CBD and a compound dosage you actually can feel the CBD working through your nervous system okay so it's much more relaxed as much more body of foreign but if you take it in a low dosage look for instance let's just say you take under 10 milligrams per dosage it's probably like a dietary supplement you may not feel it most likely you won't depending how sensitive your bothering body is depending which a tolerant level is okay everyone's body tone is a little bit different but generally under about ten milligrams you may not feel the CBD at all okay so that's how I generally tell people how much they take now how do you actually know how much to take let's just say you're trying to achieve a 15 milligram per sitting okay number one you get the bottle shake up really well obviously - you can look at how much milliliter this bottle is okay by volume this here is a 30 milliliters so you take 30 milliliters divided by the milligram by volume this is 750 milligram by the volume by the bottle okay so I think the math comes out to 25 mgs okay now in in the 30 milliliter bottle each squeeze of the dropper the entire dropper if you pump one full dropper into you know your cup or your directly under your mouth it's actually a 1 milliliter per vial per pump okay not per drop per pump okay that means I squeeze I'm squeezing and let go one full vial take it out squeeze it into the cup that is one milliliter verse and now now if you remember this bottle is thirty milliliter that means you have thirty pumps here okay that means each pump is a total of 25 milligrams I don't know if I made that clear but you take the number from the milliliter of the bottle divided by how many milligrams the volume of the bottle that will give you the milligrams per one squeeze which is one milliliter okay that's how you do the math for anything whether it's a thousand so I take a thousand divided by thirty which gives me thirty-three point three three mgs per pump okay that's one milliliter thirty three point three three mg milligram per vial per squeeze okay now if pretend this was 33 and you want to drop it down the half obviously you would squeeze half the vial that'll give you 15 point three three or fifteen point something all right so that's how we're able to dosage dosage how much milligram you're getting per content so somebody like me I have lower tolerance I take 15 milligrams I am all good alright I feel it any more than that you might get a little more nosh not nauseous sorry a little more tired a little more relaxed a lot more extra relaxed depending on your your your body weight to the fat ratio okay you like I said there's a talk there's a self learning curve between you and and the product I would start off with 10 to 15 milligrams see how you like it if you want more in the next usage you just you know throw in an extra full squeeze or one and a half squeeze okay however you come figure this out now the different basis of your CBDs here now we're talking specifically bottles dropper bottles here okay there's three types of bases here there's water base which is the one I'm holding right here okay there's PG which is propylene glycol base okay Andrews VG orders actually PG VG alright the water base and the water base and the VG base and the PG base you can actually directly do sublingual under your tongue or your foods or drink okay now the PG VG is all if you if you want to vape these oils in your vape pen okay they have to be a PG or VG base or both is okay PG VG or PG PG alone or VG alone you have to make sure you use a propylene or VG base not water base okay if I take this water base here and drop it into your CBD tanks or your slim tanks and you run that you're gonna get a lot of leakage because remember the solution is so much thinner just gonna seep right through the Cotton's out the breather hose it's gonna get all over your pants or your duffel bag or your backpack wherever you have it it's gonna leak right out okay so I don't recommend putting water base into your tanks only PG or VG base here okay I believe that's it if you guys have any questions comment below we'll get that we'll get back to you guys there if you guys have been using these products you have your suggestions for the audience for this community we're always learning about this stuff this is such a new industry we're still learning here we're trying to teach what we we come across here most of the time please share it with all the communities of CBD users and until next time if you guys like this

our fur babies which means searching for the best cbd products one of the biggest choices we'll have to make is between hemp seed oil and whole plant hemp oil which is the best oil for dogs keep watching hemp seed oil hemp seed oil or simply hemp oil is derived from the seeds of hemp plants the seeds are pressed together squeezing the oil out of them the seeds are believed to contain no cbd and potentially no thc either however some studies suggest that this may not be the case what we do know for sure about hemp seed oil is that it's high in omega-3 which can benefit the skin and prevent potential heart problems if your pet has a potential risk for heart problems you may want to look into getting hemp seed oil for them whole plant hemp oil whole plant hemp oil is usually just called cbd oil unlike hemp oil cbd comes from several different parts of the plant more specifically it comes from the stalks flowers and leaves also unlike hemp oil cbd oil contains cannabinoids including the one it's named for however hemp oil and cbd oil are similar in that they're supposed to contain little to no thc the exception is full spectrum cbd which often has small amounts of thc left in on purpose we should offer a word of caution before talking about cbd though marijuana doesn't seem to harm humans very much high doses of certain products like recreational marijuana could potentially kill a pet the good news is that most products sold for pets won't contain anywhere near a high enough concentration to cause serious harm as long as you follow the dosing instructions everything should be fine safety the biggest concern most pet parents have is the safety of their fur babies this has led many to question whether cbd and hemp oil is safe the truth is a bit complex but the simple answer is yes your pet should be perfectly safe when taking hemp oil or cbd products designed for pets like most medicines pet cbd products are portioned by how much is safe the ingredient in cannabis that can potentially be toxic to pets is thc but serious injuries can only occur if you give your pet a lot of thc medical marijuana in general often has reduced quantities of thc compared to what's available recreationally 10 thc content in medical products for humans is considered extremely high by the us government and it's about as much as you can get with medical marijuana already having much less thc than recreational pet sources are going to be incredibly low on thc cbd products cbd comes in a few different forms even for pets we've been focusing on oil but there are others many companies sell treats and chews that also contain measured amounts of cbd hemp seed oil usually comes as oil but there are also capsules containing hemp seed oil which of these is the best option though oil is the most popular option but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best the best may depend on what you're looking for cbd doses for dogs should begin at one milligram per 10 pounds of pet weight twice daily cbd treats tend to come at a lower cost and are much easier to find doses for but they may not be the best bang for your bark oil costs more but the number of doses you will get often vary for each pet it could be that your pet needs a small dose which means that a bottle of oil will last longer than a bag of treats so there you have it these were some potential benefits for your furry friend here but there may be many others it might be a good idea to do more research so be sure to check out some of the other in-depth articles shared on the site or

introduce you to somebody this is Cory Cory is a Chihuahua mix and they think he's about nine years old he's been with me for about four years now and he wants to tell his story so he came to me pretty pretty beaten up and abuse his action inside her house program which means the Humane Society considers them unadoptable but he's been an absolute sweetheart and the doll but a couple weeks ago he had a seizure in the middle of the night and if you've ever seen the dog have a seizure report it's for me it was scary anyway and I gave him some Reiki and he calmed down after a little while I was very relieved but then in a day or two he had another little seizure and then a couple of days after that he had another big seizure in the middle of the night so obviously I was worried and was giving him Reiki and biofeedback and I obviously didn't want the tremors or the seizures to come back again so I started doing some research and what we ended up doing is I'm gonna show him your product we ended up getting him on us pause it's a CBD I don't normally rep products that this is awesome we started giving him these little biscuits for joint support and also have CBD oil in it and then also started giving them six drops of the Lazarus Lazarus Lazarus naturals it's called on a biscuit so I give him a little half a biscuit yeah you like these don't you already have it yours today though so give him this little half a biscuit you can have one more once a day and then six drops of this on another biscuit once a day and he has not had any seizures since we started doing this and his joints and legs have actually been much better he's been sleeping great at night and so if your dog is having seizures I would highly recommend you check out some CBD oils for them their work for Cory and I hope it works for you and your dog", "chBuSIJ2fbQ": "guys it is Sam again and I am back with another video for you regarding CBD and the last video if you didn't watch my last video it was on a vape pen so if you didn't see the vape pen a review on CBD FX I would highly recommend going over there and looking at that but for this I am doing a CBD oil now this CBD oil is called kidney B the company Canady is very reputable I believe I believe they have about four point four to 4.8 stars out of five on several platforms you can go research them yourself but I would highly recommend listening to what I have to say about it I have been taking this for three days only three days but I have been taking CBD for over three years so this is full-spectrum CBD oil what that means is it has THC in it it has less than 0.3 percent THC in it the reason why is because it is the legal dose that you can take in America in all 50 states except for Oregon carrot California Colorado Washington they're all recreationally legal for anything but in other states the point the below 0.3% is 100% legal and safe so the reason why I brought up TC is because I like products with THC in them the compounds of THC and CBD works so well for me together if I just sorry if I just use a CBD isolate I am going to not feel right I'm gonna not feel good at all because it's something that doesn't do anything for me like it does do stuff for me but it makes me feel off it makes me feel weird so this has enough THC in it for me to feel good I just feel good with it and I do feel THC and especially in small amounts I'm very sensitive to THC so if you're sensitive to THC I wouldn't recommend this if you still if you still want to try to each see in your system and you still want to try having it in your CBD oils or your CBD vape pens I would do some more research on the products that can Navy has or if you want to CBD FX or go to pure relief com now I want to talk about what I have in my system right now so right now I have this in my system about 20 to 24 milligrams I have something else in my system which is a CBD joint it's a pre-roll from peer relief and it had point zero three percent to each C in it and I had about 20 milligrams of that this morning this I take throughout the day this I supplement or the smoking I supplement to this this I take every day all day and I think I want to start taking the one dose in the morning and one at night because I feel like it's gonna make me feel a lot better especially with something with THC in it because it can make you a tad drowsy because I have about because I have about forty to forty four milligrams in my system I'm feeling a little bit drowsy but I think it's because of the THC in this that I'm having a little bit of a haze if you will but it's nothing it's nothing bad I don't I don't feel high well I feel slightly buzzed but that's just because my body is what my body is that doesn't have to be your body also I wanted to mention if you are 18 plus continue watching this video if you are not 18 plus if you are below 18 I would not get any of this because you're not allowed that it's still illegal for people under 18 to purchase so I would be careful with that you can't purchase it and I don't condone anyone below 18 to be using this and also I don't condone anyone to be I'm not saying anybody should use this it's actually not for everyone but I do I do strongly recommend looking it up for yourself and researching it because this can be a life changer this can be a very big game changer any CBD product so this product specifically is $69 it is the 750 milligrams but 'el it is 30 milliliters in lemon-lime full-spectrum CBD oil I got it for $69 now you can look up a coupon code for this I used a coupon code it saved me roughly 25% I believe so that'll be super handy if you're you know tight on cash as the pandemic is making you but yeah I would highly recommend looking at this and trying it my consensus on this as it makes me feel hazed it makes me feel groggy if I take too much or if I take it with something else I took this with another CBD product so they're kind of making me feel more groggy than normal but this would make me feel hast not groggy not tired hazed and what I mean by that is a relaxed pace and it's because of the THC like I said but it makes me feel extremely calm extremely clear-headed extremely clear minded and I don't feel like and I feel like I'm in control of my emotions more so and I feel like I'm in control of my daily tasks and things that I can get done during the day another thing about this is it's rated I think I already said that this one is rated at 4.7 out of 5 stars so I also have really good sleeps at night from this I have 8 to 9 hours of sleep per night and I was starting to before I took this I was starting to not get any sleep at night I would take this and I would weirdly or not take this sorry I would take this and not weirdly stay up I would weirdly fall asleep right off the bat as soon as I just like thought about bed and I put my head to the pillow I would just get sleep people with insomnia I should really try this and people with insomnia 25 milligrams is probably not gonna put you to sleep I think 50 milligrams is gonna put you to sleep so literally two servings of this also you have to shake well before you use it and it has directions for that but so yeah insomnia anxiety depression because I had probably problems sleeping I'm not saying or diagnosing this to insomnia patients I'm saying that I had trouble sleeping so this helped me now this is something that I never really talked about but I have digestive issues everyone really has digestive issues at some point in their life but I haven't tried digestive issues that kind of make and manifest my anxiety and depression on a daily level and especially when I eat something that is not good for me so I take CBD to also supplement that it doesn't cover it up like a lot of people say it does like cover up symptom or it covers up symptoms but like in a good way and it's also a natural pain reliever it's not temporary the pain relief is supposed to be there or that the pain is it there anymore when you take this and you're not supposed to just take this to supplement to make yourself feel better you can take this while being healthy because it restores your gut bacteria backed back to its natural flora I'm sorry I'm slurring my words anyway so that's what I take this is what I take for digestive issues because I have IBS borderline Crohn's disease so I take this and this makes me feel ten times better so it doesn't recommend nobody recommends you driving on this I can drive I can drive on this very well I'm actually way more focused than any other time but nobody recommends that you drive on it and that's because of the THC content but also because for some people it makes you drowsy and that's with the CBD and the THC so you can also walk take full walks and exercise very good very well with this I walk every day and this just amplifies it amplifying meaning making it a lot better to walk and a lot better to run or jog or exercise it makes you feel a lot better it doesn't make you dizzy it doesn't give you any weird side effects when you exercise now that that's just for me it doesn't give me any weird I'm saying you because I would think that it doesn't really happen to anyone else but I can't say that as a fact because I only know my body now I also want to tell you that you don't get high off of this that's the one thing that you want to take away you don't get high off of it so you're not gonna get a legal high off of this I get a legal buzz because I'm very sensitive to any form of THC any it doesn't matter how much is in the oil I still get a little bit affected that's not to say that you will but this is still not a high product so anyway if you are not feeling too well if you're not feeling the best right now if you're not if you're feeling more anxious and depressed as opposed to normal as opposed to have how you normally feel I would greatly suggest looking this up don't go off of my word go look it up for yourself online and do some research before you try to try this but I tried it it works for me it makes me feel very good I don't know if I come across high in this video but I'm buzzed to say the least it's just a buzz it's not like it's not like I'm higher placed so it feels it I feel it most oh my god I can't talk I feel it most in my head like right here and it feels good to me it makes me feel comforted and calm and just down-to-earth and relaxed for anyone else if you don't like that head feeling I would recommend getting something again without THC but anyways try to take care of yourself during the pandemic try to take care of yourself during a protest also black lives do matter just so you know they really do and hopefully you will take away that with the message of CBD oil being your relief from any anxiety that you're feeling from any emotions that you can't control from anything that is going on in the real world right now a lot of people have it way worse and they matter so I just wanted to end on a good note I really hope that you guys try this out and you can put in the comments if you did like I said I'll have a link to the website and to this specific tincture in the description below and I hope that you all have a beautiful day night evening wherever you are in the world bye", "CQWaU_v8q18": "hey we just wanted to do a real quick review on the hemp oil that we bought for our dogs zero our dog zero suffers from a little bit of stress and anxiety and we were looking at different medications and we tried different medications and we wanted something just a little bit more natural that wouldn't be so hard on his organs and we decided to give hemp oil a try now real quick before we get into it I just want to say it's been working great for him we love the results and he seems to really like it if he was in here he'd probably tell you but let's talk about the product a little bit so we ordered it from bark box we got it on Amazon the reason we decided on bark box is product is because we really like bark box as a company you may have seen some of our monthly subscription bark box unboxings and heard us talk about how amazing their customer services as well as their company so we felt comfortable going with them hemp oil is supposed to help with anxiety stress pain relief and inflammation we're using it simply just for the anxiety and stress relief now it has none of the THC it doesn't get your dog high or anything like that and for our dog it doesn't make a Mathare Jick nothing like that just takes that edge of anxiety off so he doesn't get so withdrawn now since he's six and a half years old we can tell when he's gonna have a bad day we can just kind of notice by his behavior so on those days is when we give them the hemp oil we don't give 0 the hemp oil every day now there haven't been a lot of long-term actually I don't know of any real long-term studies done on the cumulative effects of hemp oil on animals so kind of taking a risk here but we felt that it was worth it given that we didn't want to pump our dog full of drugs you apply it with a little dropper you can put it on food you can put it right in your dog's mouth the dosage is dependent on the dog's weight it's made a huge difference in zero we've used it for about a month now and on those days where it seems like he needs a little help it really helps mout he's more playful he's more active he's out and about a little bit more and we're really happy we're really happy with the results we can tell when zero is having a bad day just kind of by his behavior almost immediately in the morning so those are the days we give him the hemp oil we don't give zero oil every day again since there haven't been studies done long-term studies done on hemp oil on dogs we're not sure how it'll affect them but we were trying other drugs that we knew are gonna affect his kidney and liver so we thought this might be a better way to go we were willing to take the chance if you want to try this for your pet I would definitely suggest doing the research also talk to your vet to see if they think it's a good idea some vets endorse it some vets don't it might be better to have a conversation with your vet to see what they feel and their experience has been with hemp oil for dogs again we just wanted to do a real quick review to say how happy we are with the results of the hemp oil and how much we're happy that we gave it a shot we're gonna do another review in a few months to see how zero has reacted to the hemp oil after being on it for a while and be sure to let you know how things have progressed and if you have any questions by all means we're not experts but we more than happy to talk about it thanks again for watching [Music]", "2yZkulTsDYg": "[Music] what's going on yo shout-out to tweedle farms if you have not heard of them I don't know where you've been CBD products awesome CBD flour

power of a concentrated dose of CVD with a higher than usual concentration of CBG using only TAC free high CBG distillate this tincture boasts a twenty to one ratio of CBD to c22 one CBD CBD ratio that means that for every 20 milligrams of CBD you ingest you also get one milligram of CBG all right so uh I guess you wonder what the hell CBG is all I'm gonna tell you kena biker all is one of more

mil one is 1 mil is the dropper and the serving servings per container is 15 so you can drop this right here it's saying it's 15 servings in here so you will use this 15 times depending on how you medicate this one besides when I last you too long so you're able to get this up into a 30 mil bottle and a 30 mil contains 30 doses per container but again who knows how much you will you need to

use there's not really a wrong way to use your thing to use are tinctures but we suggest that you put them under your tongue as you saw we do so that cannabinoids can be absorbed by the mucous

a finger while giving her a treat I love her too little grunts and her snorts and when she snores one of the reasons that we named her potato is because she was a little overweight when we got her so she has dropped lots of weight and when we groomed her we found all these little tumors all over her that looked like little spuds growing on a potato at the beginning we would give her a full dose of

can be harmful for your pets and that's why I recommend our pet products for your pets because we have absolutely no THC so I recommend you starting very low a low serving size for your pet so whether

like on the go wherever i am did you take cbd today of course how do you think i'm gonna survive this podcast i think it's definitely gonna get us through", "zZPtvghoqeQ": "hi my name is Emily Gibson and I want to talk to you today about how CBD and hemp oil can help inside of your body first of all I want to talk about how it is not going to get you high this was the biggest question that I have for myself and it's the biggest question that I still get from others when I first was looking into hemp and CBD oil about two years ago this was the thing that for me I was most uneducated about I remembered seeing a hemp plant thinking that looks like marijuana I don't want anything to do with it and it was very uneducated of me because I didn't look into it I didn't learn about it to understand that it was not a drug so first of all something that's really exciting for you to know is that the way that hemp oil and CBD oil is produced in the United States it is legal in all 50 states so this is not something that is illegal this is not something that is going to get you in trouble with the law and no matter what your religious beliefs are this is not something that is going to interfere with with any sort of any sort of moral standards that you live by if you abstain from drugs and alcohol this was a huge concern of mine so it's really important for you to understand that because it was important for me when I was looking into deciding if this was something I wanted to put inside of my body so just in review there is the hemp plant and there is the marijuana plant the hemp plant is going to have point 0 3 of THC in it that is going to have zero psychoactive effects inside of your body you will not get a high from it it is not a drug and you are not going to be breaking the law the marijuana plant which is a completely different breed is something that will give you a high it has those psychoactive effects to give you a high it is a drug and it is illegal on the federal level ok different states have different laws but on a federal level it is illegal so the hemp plant is a breed but it is not the same thing as the marijuana plant okay everyone's with me on that hemp plant good legal safe no hi zero psycho affective or psycho psychoactive effects you are not going to get a high from it point zero three of it is going to be in there because it is a breed of the marijuana plant but you will not get a high it is legal you are okay to take it alright so there are lots of different kinds of hemp plants and CBD oils and there's hemp oil and CBD oil and hemp and so what's the difference between all of these things first of all CBD is just a piece of the hemp plant so they're extracting one piece of it and it's the CBD that they're extracting out it's a small small percentage of the plant so if you're looking at an oil that says it's a CBD oil and that's all that's in it you're not going to be getting as many effects as if you were to have a CBD hemp oil that is a full spectrum now the full spectrum is what I have been using for the last two months and it is what I am so passionate about and what has helped me with my health so significantly so when you see a full spectrum hemp that's even better than a normal hemp oil or a CBD oil because it has the CBD it has CBG it has the cannabinoids it has the terpenes it has the flavonoids it has all of the things that are going to help your body in all of these different ways so how do they help your body right like this is the big question once you are comfortable with okay it's safe okay it's legal okay I won't get a high then what you want to know is how is it gonna help me what is it gonna do inside of my body and that's what I'm so excited to tell you about today so first of all at the end of the 90s they found out that we have a system in our bodies that's just like our circulatory system our lymphatic system all of our systems in our body right except this system is called an endo cabin oyd system and when these cannabinoids from the full-spectrum yep plant not the marijuana plant right we're not talking about the marijuana plant we're talking about the full spectrum hemp plant and they are actually going to bind from your binder receptors and that is gonna cause an effect in your body of homeostasis of healing and there's all sorts of receptors inside of your body there's a ton of concentrated receptors inside of your brain there are some inside of your reproductive organs inside of your intestinal tract this is why it's so exciting for people who are really catching on to the idea of why hemp and CBD oil has so many healing qualities and that's really what I've been looking at over the last two years and as I have researched it and learned from friends about this I have become more knowledgeable about why this is something that my body needs and why I want it and why I'm so excited about it so as I've looked into this the first company that I ever tried will probably be the last company that I ever try because it's the company that I represent and I'm so grateful that that's where I started there's so much that I love about their oil and that it's done for me so I really want to focus on just one of the things that is in it because regardless of whatever hemp oil you're using or CBD oil that you're using this one is so special because of this so it has MTC's in it and if you look on the back of a bottle or sorry M C T M C T's in it and it's using it's derived from coconuts so what is that like what is an M C C because I had to do all the research on this to figure it out it's basically something that is going to be a carrier right and oil is like a carrier so it's basically going to be a carrier to make sure that you are absorbing all of the healing properties of the oil MCTS are really really great because they have some things that they are they may help to do so for example MCT oil from coconut may help to promote healthy weight loss it may help to be an instant source of energy that can also that can be used as fuel for your brain so MCTS the multiple chain triglycerides that's what that stands for they travel straight from your gut to your liver they don't require to be broken down by bile so since MTC's easily enter the cells without being broken down they can be used as an immediate source of energy so this is huge for athletes especially right because if they're gonna use something like a product like a hemp oil or a CBD that has MC T's in it they can use it right before their workout and it's going to basically may help to on lock the burning of fat instead of carbohydrates so it's gonna help them have more energy faster energy in the gym especially it's great for people who are on keto because it can be converted into ketones in the liver these ketones can pass through blood-brain barrier so it's making them more convenient source of energy for our brain cells also MCTS MCT oil may reduce lactic acid buildup in athletes so that is huge because it helps you to use fat for energy use fat before carbs this is so huge and exciting right MCTS could help manage certain seizure things again these are not proven things this is not the research I'm just saying that MCT oil may be linked to these things so that's really important to understand other things is MCTS contain powerful fatty acids and that can help fight yeast and bacterial growth MCTS may reduce the risk of factors for heart disease such as weight loss and cholesterol and all of those things and what's really exciting about this is that the reason why they say it may help to or it could help to is because what find is when they do research on people and animals and everything what they find is that it doesn't help every time in every situation so they can't say it's proven too because they don't have a large enough group of people that they can make those claims about so what I always tell people is that this may or may not work for you but give it a try because if it does work for you wouldn't that be so great right and then the final thing that MCTS really helped with or they may help to control blood sugar levels and support clutch support the management of blood sugar imbalance so the biggest things that I've seen with this for me personally and I am a healthy person that has never been diagnosed with any sort of disease or issue or whatever but I have noticed that for me personally when I started using it within two days my sleep was so deep that I felt dead like my husband would say I've never seen you in such a deep sleep before my sleep is more restful I am falling so deep into my pillow and my bed I feel like I sink down deep into the middle of my bed like the only way I can describe it is when I'm sleeping at night I feel like I'm sleeping like down halfway into my mattress I feel like I've sunk down deep into my mattress because I'm so deeply asleep another thing that I've noticed with it is my my inflammation is not as high so when I talk about that whenever I eat sugar I noticed that I can feel it in my hands almost immediately within several hours and by the next day if I've allowed myself to you know indulge in a treat or for some sort of a party or a festivity or something I will feel the consequence of having that sugar in my hands especially and what I noticed about a month into using using a hemp CBD product was that I did not have that I didn't have that in my hands it wasn't there even though I had had significant amount of sugar the night before so again these are all amazing benefits that you may may not see with a CBD or hemp product but it's something that I'm so excited about especially the MCT oil that is in it because that carrier may or could help with so many different things in your life so I'm super excited about that and I know there's gonna be so much more that we are all gonna learn about CBD and hemp as we embark on this new exciting product that so many of us are starting to use one of the things that that I want to share just in conclusion is that if you have used another product before I mean I obviously haven't so I don't have anything to compare it to but my good good friend who uses has used you know 15 to 20 different kinds my friend Jamie she I had her test just 0.25 ml of this product that I've been loving and she told me several hours later she had to go to sleep it was working so well so it's not gonna put you to sleep at the wheel or anything like that that's not what I'm saying but all I'm saying is that she is someone who knows so much about supplements and health and CBD and she's tried 15 to 20 different types and she can tell the difference of what a good CBD product is and one that's absorbing and one that you're getting the full effects and healing properties from and her experience with with mine was that a very very small amount of it immediately worked for her so significantly that she was able to tell right away and she said that is good stuff that is absorbing big time and she compared to other things that she's taken that she knows she's not absorbing it as much so that to me really got me exciting excited because I thought gosh we have really got something huge here I have nothing to compare it to but my friends who do

Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

pot or marijuana is an increasingly popular way to treat arthritis cancer and anxiety in pets new edibles and oils contain cannabidiol or CBD a natural element in cannabis that doesn't get pets high but some veterinarians say has healing properties without the potential harm of traditional pharmaceuticals they can cause stomach upset kidney damage or liver damage a lot of pets are unable to handle the harsher side effects of some of those medications California veterinarian Tim Shue created vet CBD oil which he does not prescribe and is only available through medical marijuana dispensaries Rachael Martin says it helped her dog Sophie fight cancer for the second time Sophie's vet gave her just two months to live it just felt like a race against the clock at that point after spending thousands of dollars on traditional treatments Martin tried CBD oil at the last resort adding a few drops into Sophie's food every day in those two months it was a complete turnaround and I was sold and now over a year later she came back from the brink and got a whole new lease on life Jodie Beliveau never thought she would see her Pug Tyson walk again after he lost the use of his hind legs from arthritis I was spending 125 dollars a week for six weeks for acupuncture a month of CBD treatment is $80 Lexi Davis says cannabis reduced her pitbull Ozzy's anxiety she has been so awesome she's like loving life so much more she's like playing with her toys more are nothing cannabis pet products are not yet regulated and the California Veterinary Medical Association says vets are legally barred from prescribing or recommending them marijuana is legal in 29 states plus the District of Columbia and illegal under federal law some vets say there isn't enough data to show that it's safe for all animals a lot of traditional veterinarians would never recommend pot for pets why do you if cannabis offers a potential therapeutic route with minimal side effects then it's our duty to explore those options non traditional healing methods from an unlikely source helping some four-legged family members get through tough times now these pet products do not have any of that THC the element of marijuana that has the psychoactive or addictive effects but medicinal cannabis of course for pets has become this big business potential and it's a multi-billion dollar pet pharmaceutical industry that continues to grow yeah it looks like there were some real results that's amazing and a lot of these owners feel just so relieved it eases a little bit of pain what she says two months later it was a complete yeah", "pDBaK-Ba9eY": "hey everyone its Josie here with bio MD and here at bio MD we believe that education is key as buyers it's really important for you to understand what it is you're purchasing and what is the right product for you having numerous terms presented in the CBD industry there needs to be some clarification regarding the differences between the different kinds of CBD that are available now there are three main kinds of CBD available there's the broad spectrum CBD the full-spectrum CBD and the isolate CBD and today I'm going to explain to you some of the differences between these different variants of CBD and maybe we'll try and figure out which one's the best one for you now but before all of that let's talk a little bit about what CBD is cannabidiol or CBD is a compound that is found in the cannabis plant there are many different cannabinoids that are found in the cannabis sativa plant the two main ones that most people have heard of are THC and CBD the main difference between THC and CBD is that THC is a psychoactive compound and CBD is a non psychoactive and by psychoactive we mean when you smoke or inhale or ingest THC you feel the effect of being high and you feel a general change in your perception of the world the opposite to THC is CBD and I say it's the opposite in that you don't feel these feelings of high you don't feel any of the psychoactive effects when you take CBD however CBD is known to possess many health benefits and which is why we are more interested in CBD and its uses at bio MD now the sativa plant contains more than just THC and CBD there are other kinds of terpenes and there's other kinds of cannabinoids present in the sativa plant and it is the combination of all these different components that leads to a variance in the different types of CBD that we see so let's start with broad spectrum CBD broad spectrum CBD infuses the various substances apart from THC so it'll include CBD cannabinoids terpenes and other chemicals that are derived from the plant and at the same time it does meet the federal requirement as it has all of the THC removed but even though it has all of the THC removed since it has most of the other components of the plant you still experience the entourage effect now let's talk about full spectrum CBD full spectrum CBD will retain all of the chemical properties of the plant including THC now authentic federally legal CBD is derived from industrial hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent THC now this is very very low amounts of THC and it will not show up on a drug test all CBD products are required by law to meet this percentage and no CBD product that you consume will show up on any drug test that you take similar to the broad spectrum CBD the full spectrum CBD will also encourage the entourage effect to take place but if you take the full spectrum CBD you'll feel it a lot more than you would if you were to take the broad spectrum CBD just because the full spectrum CBD has 0.3% of THC and the broad spectrum has no THC finally let's talk about the third and the last kind of CBD which is the isolate CBD iceless CBD products are labeled as being the purest form of the product depending on how they're processed isolate products have been isolated down to just the CBD molecules so it'll contain nothing else they do not possess any other active ingredient no terpenes or other cannabinoids so this is the purest form of CBD that you can ingest this type of product is generally processed as a white powder and also can be included in oil now again there are many other factors that can affect CBD for example various growing seasons can cause the individual mix of components to vary like one growing season can have a yield that's exceptionally high in CBD whereas the other yield based on temperature weather might have a yield that's a little bit lower in CBD and again the variation of chemicals might be different depending on the state's climate that the CBD is produced in the weather in Kentucky is very different from the weather in California so you will find differences in the CBD that are grown in different states another difference that may impact the product is the extraction process itself ethanol and superficial fluid of co2 both have advantages and disadvantages but do not produce identical product because the extraction itself will impact the chemicals that are resulting from this process I will end on saying that choosing which CBD product that meets your specific needs is a personal choice if you want to assure that there is no THC present in your CBD I would recommend going for the isolate strain however if you want to expect an experience a feeling of calmness that is more tangible maybe like at the end of the night maybe right before you go to bed you want to experience a feeling of calmness in your muscles then I would recommend either the broad spectrum or the full spectrum and there is really no harm in trying out different products and seeing which one works best for you and your personal needs there are many coupon codes available for most of these CBD products and that is one way to save money and still try out different strands and see what works best for you so good luck on this journey you [Music]", "RfMgBcNh0LM": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today we're going to talk about the Charlotte's Web hip extract liquid capsules that come with 25 milligrams of CVD so these Charlotte sweat liquid extract filled capsules contain 25 milligrams of a full-spectrum CBD in each capsule this is a really great option for those of you looking to supplement with CBD but perhaps you don't really love that earthy flavor commonly found in most tinctures the recommended dose is one capsule and that is a pretty strong dose if you are kind of new to supplementing with CBD show-ups webb suggests that these are great

CBD products and even more importantly you get the education you need to be able to make the most informed purchasing decision so again Green Valley Nation comm go check it out and read the rest of this review Charlotte's Web claims to be the number one hemp manufacturer in the United States by market share that's a pretty big claim to fame however they have been in this game since 2011 they have tinctures capsules like these gummies and even pet products they contain full spectrum products and they also create they've also created some isolate products as well the majority of their products are co2 extracted however they do have one line their original formula that is alcohol extracted however at this time you can only get that with a prescription like from your laughter so each of these capsules contain 25 milligrams of a full-spectrum CBD something that's really cool about Charlotte's Web is that they are US hemp Authority certified and they are C GMP certified as well they made a 98 on their most recent audit which basically tells you and me that these things are created and manufactured in a really nice facility cGMP good manufacturing processing that's kind of like a grading score that they even give pharmaceutical compounding facility so the place that is making your prescription drugs that they are held to the same standards as these Charlotte's Web manufacturing so basically you know every single time you take one of these capsules whether it's from this bottle or your next you're going to get the exact same result because you're going to have a very very very almost identical basically product it's a really good indication of Charlotte's Web dedication to quality and making sure we get the absolute best CBD supplement now you're probably looking at this thing and saying okay what's in it that's the really cool thing inside this box you'll have a bottle that has 30 capsules inside each capsule is just the hemp extract and olive oil it is a vegetarian capsule so it's a these are vegetarian vegan friendly actually these are also non-gmo and they are currently evaded available in US Canada Brazil and in certain places inside the UK depending on availability I kind of get the impression that our friends across the pond may have a bit of a problem maintaining inventory levels so you guys definitely make sure to call the retailers to make sure it is in stock okay now we're going to talk about the test results I'm so excited to be up here and tell you about these new test results that Charlotte's Web is giving out this is actually a brand new product it is replacing these extra-strength capsules this was last year's version of their capsules and this is this year's and I'm super excited to tell you that unlike last year's version of the COAS which basically just told you how much CBD and how much see isn't it and nothing else these new test results actually disclose so much more in fact you find out that there's 0.11% THC which is definitely an illegal mountain grounds and you can see that there's C B G and C B C as well as the CBD that's kind of giving you a big idea of the full spectrum effect that you can expect to get when you take this product because you're getting more than just the CBD another really cool thing about the test results is that they show that it passes for both microbials and pesticides now what does that mean that means that in this test in the test for this batch in particular there were no signs for pesticides and microbials which makes me feel pretty good because I'm not putting you know yucky stuff in my system the one thing I will tell you about the Charlotte's Web Co is is it's kind of like a treasure hunt to get to it I do appreciate the fact that Charlotte's Web is now putting the lot number on the bottom of the box in addition to putting it on the bottom of the bottle and it's in your packing slip the way that you access the COA is you click on you use this QR code however if you don't want to use a QR code totally okay make sure you check out the written portion down below or on our website at Green Valley nation.com and you can get the direct link to the batch results and we will even have a copy of these COAS in our review so now you're probably wondering what is it like to take these so if you're anything like me I was a little bit worried because I really liked the capsules that came before the extra strength capsules these are like a dry form and you might actually still see a few of these in stores near you is a powder in the old one these are liquid filled so it's using an olive oil as its carrying base and so I was very worried that it would leak or that it would cause me to have some indigestion and then there we go I have that natural flavor of the CBD but luckily as you can see that's why I wanted to keep it inside the box there's not been any leaking which is awesome other liquid-filled capsule had and the studio have leaped a bit and I haven't gotten any of that nasty actor flavor so that's pretty awesome as well another really great thing about the liquid craps is that there's 25 milligrams of CBD in last year's model there was only 18 milligrams of CBD so it's actually increasing the total amount of the cannabinoids CBD in these capsules I have been taking the Charlotte's Web capsules I started out with the extra strength a little over a year ago and I just got these into the studio within the last within the last month and so I can tell you that I still absolutely love taking these pills they help me to stay focused they reduce my chronic pain I have pain in my low back and like in my feet and they really do help me to sleep they don't make me sleepy but if I take it before bed I can go to sleep and they will help me to stay asleep all night which as a busy mother of two and entrepreneur is very important so now you probably want to witness me take it keep in mind these are vegetarian like vegetable pulao most they're not plastic but they sort of do feel like plastic so if you have trouble swallowing capsules definitely make sure to have some water I usually don't need a capsule to take one of these you just kind of pop it in and go but it does take about thirty minutes as much as much as an hour to start feeling the effects which is a little bit different than a tincture so here you go bottoms up are you ready to hear my top three reasons why you should try this Charlotte's Web 25 milligram liquid fill capsules number one is that these capsules work the 25 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD it totally helps to reduce all of my pain in my back and in my feet and it helps me to stay focused oftentimes CBD supplements can make me get really sleepy and so I don't love to take them during the day these Charlotte's Web capsules I can take one capsule in the morning it takes away all my pain and even better I get just the point where I can focus you know like the days before social media focus like I could go 90 minutes and I haven't even looked at my phone it's really great to help me reduce pain and it also helps me to get and stay focused I also really really loved the fact that well frankly that it's a capsule I don't love the flavors of a lot of the tinctures they're very very earthy I love that term by the way because I don't know what that means it they don't necessarily taste that great and so the capsules give me the ability to get my CBD supplement and without any of the shall we say more natural flavors commonly associated with CBD supplementation now you're probably wanting to know the but part here's the buck part Charlotte's Web is a premium product that means you're going to have to pay a little bit more for it these actually come in at about three dollars a capsule US which is a little bit over market price however Charlotte's Web is an industry leader they do have the number one market share and they are manufactured in a professional pharmaceutical grade facility so you know exactly what you're going to get that's basically my biggest complaint is that it is a little bit more expensive the packaging it's come a long way from the where it was last last year when it was just black and white it was really kind of hard to see things now that we have this nice gold color it's really really easy to tell exactly how much CBD is on it but it's still not super easy for you to figure out where the co-pays are thankfully they're now adding the lot numbers on both the bottoms of the box and the bottle but if you don't have the website to look in that number and if you don't know how to use the QR code you're kind of like alright how do I get there so keep those two things in mind when you are considering purchasing the Charlotte's Web 25 milligram hip extracted liquid capsules well that's it for me you guys I hope you enjoyed this review of the Charlotte's Web liquid-filled hip extract capsules I really do like taking them and I'm curious to know if you guys have seen any of these in your local CBD retailers yet I just got them and so I'm curious to see if you've tried them and if you like them better or if you liked the extra strength capsules from last year better I have still seen I'm still seeing more of the extra strength capsules in in my local retailers but I am really excited to hear what you guys think if you like the liquid feel better than the powdered filled or have you ever had anything spill so I'm let me know by leaving me some comments down below I'm really curious to see what your thoughts are again my name is Jennifer Dixon with green valley nation and I can't wait to see you again soon take care bye bye [Music]", "l0AntCR6314": "hello everybody and welcome back to your word cannabis and today's video we're going to be making a CBD alcohol tincture but first if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind give the video a thumbs up it would help our channel out quite a bit so today we're going to be making an alcohol-based CBD tincture this is a simple yet kind of complex recipe only because of the amount of plant material that goes into this recipe normally if you've seen my other videos about making cannabis oil or CBD oil if we're talking grams to cup of oil so you know a certain amount of grams per cup of oil and that's usually the recipe it can be fluctuated but today we're going to be talking Elsa's 2 cup so we're going to be using ounces of flour per cup of alcohol and the reason this is is because alcohol can extract plant material the best it's pretty much the best home remedy to get the most out of plant material it grabs onto those cannabinoids and rips them off the plant material and it makes some really potent stuff and you can use it for all kinds of different applications including adding to your wine or drink at night but for today we're just making a base alcohol tincture so I've already measured out 3.3 ounces of CBD by ops flower and this runs at 21.1% CBD we've also used our trim bag recently so you haven't checked that video please do and we're going to be using some Vioxx flower trim and the reason why I have some trim here and flower is because I want to do about one ounce of flower per cup of alcohol so we're going to be making three cups of CBD alcohol tincture today but I want to use the trim to add CBD a to the mix we want this to be a full-spectrum CBD alcohol tincture so we'll be using some of this probably only about an ounce or two of trim along with the three point three ounces of flour so as always we're going to decarbonize de carve our trim because when you dakar you lose the a and cbda and it becomes CBD so we're going to be getting all of our CBD from the flower and we'll be getting a lot of our CBD a from the trend and if you haven't seen my decarboxylated technique run through it really quick today all I do is they preheat my oven to 250 degrees and I put my flower in there for roughly a half an hour you can go a little bit more you can go a little bit less it really depends on what you want your conversion to be but I like to go right about half an hour sometimes 35 minutes or 40 minutes given the amount of material I may go 40 minutes today so I'm gonna preheat the oven on a decarboxylate this and then we're going to get started using our magic butter machine and the recipe to make our CBD alcohol tincture okay so our hemp flour has now decarboxylated I did 250 degrees for 40 minutes just because of the amount of material I wanted to make sure that that was going to be fully d carved then while I was waiting for that to D carb I measured out one ounce of biotics flour trim so now let's get the magic butter machine and start making this alcohol texture okay so now we have our magic butter machine and we have our one ounce of not decarboxylated hemp flour trim and we also have our decarboxylated hemp flour so today the alcohol we'll be using is a fan-favorite for extraction this is Everclear its grain alcohol and it's a hundred and ninety proof now you can't get this here or Virginia and certain states you cannot get it in so you're just going to look for your high prove I know a lot of states is a 151 or something like that whatever the case is but the higher the proof the more extraction and this is going to give us pretty much the best extraction we can buy so all we need to start doing is gonna get our not decarboxylated trim and we're going to start adding our decarboxylated fat flower okay get that in there all right so now we have all of our flower in our magic butter machine as you can see this thing is packed full but that's going to be okay so that is this is four point three ounces of products so this is all biotics flower in here this is four point three ounces of Vioxx hemp flour whether it's trim flower it's just all plant material so now I'm going to be doing three cups of alcohol so we'll measure here now you see why I use three cups just happens to be a coincidence that it's the 750 milliliter Everclear is just about 3 cups so once you've measured that out go ahead and pour that in okay now we're all squared up everything is in we're going to put the top on our magic butter machine as we always do and we're going to plug it in okay so now we've plugged in our magic butter machine all as well so for an alcohol tincture you're gonna go to a hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do eight hours now you can do four but I want the most out of it so I'm gonna do eight hours so we'll see it eight hours and we'll show you the finished product okay so the magic butter machine is all done and we just got a scoop off all the remaining plant material now remember this was like four point three ounces of plant material so there is quite a bit but you're gonna be really surprised what it looks like in there so it all gets blended down and I'll show you here so what was once a pile of flour is now gone so we're just going to dump it all out into the micron bag try to get everything out of here this is a quite a bit of plant material now at the bottom I'll scoop some out so you can see it just put that right into the white crumb bag but while the plant material in this recipe a lot different than the will recipes so now that that's done put your silicone glove on your dominant hand so you can squeeze it the best clean that up a little bit so the amount of plant material makes it definitely more challenging than the oil recipes because you're squeezing four ounces of plant material dried plant material now it's all wet can be quite the challenge and so what I like to do is put it right back in to the Everclear bottle so you know it's the alcohol tincture so that's what we're going to do here so that's our recipe that's what I have for you today folks I hope you enjoyed this recipe and use it to your advantage I will leave the recipe in the description below on the video go ahead and try it yourself if you have any comments

that we actually make here at ambery Gardens but is also the highest concentration in our full spectrum daily line now these are internally taking products you would either put on a spoon to drink down or put under the tongue and this particular one has 5,000 milligrams of CBD in the bottle if you were to take it in the amounts written right here you would have 84 milligrams of CBD per press we'll get into a little further details of how these breakdowns work here in just a little bit this is an MCT coconut oil version of our product which means you're getting a long-lasting and natural breakdown of CBD over time this is perfect for individuals that have been told by their doctor to find a larger amount of CBD we find some people as well coming to us that are addressing more severe health challenges and are wanting to take a larger amount of CBD as well everybody is different and some people's bodies require just a simply larger amount of CBD per day so if you are looking for the breakdown of this product on our website go ahead and head to the description tab of this particular product and you'll be able to find a written version of this breakdown there but let's go ahead and go into that here for you now in our dosage scale we have two units of measurement we like to use and let's go ahead and establish those now the first one we have is a dropper which is the amount you're gonna see written right here on the side in this particular bottle that is getting you 84 milligrams of CBD to get that amount we're gonna go ahead and start from a completely empty dropper so we'll just kind of press all that out of there press down as hard as we can on the top of that dropper making sure everything gets pressed in push this down in and let it go and we'll get this exact measured amount of oil that we're looking for okay now in this particular version once again that is 84 milligrams of CBD that's in a pretty small amount of oil which is why it's so dark like that it's a very highly concentrated form in this guy now if we wanted to break that down further we like to do that in drops to get a drop you just need to give a slow small amount of pressure allowing for that to form and fall giving a little bit in between each one so we can really make sure that we're consistent okay now in this particular one here one drop is going to be worth about one point eight six milligrams of CVD so one drop is actually worth a pretty you know a consistent and solid dose in in a product like this three drops is going to be getting you about five milligrams of CBD so one two three that was five milligrams right there and if we were wanting to get ten milligrams we would do six drops and for this bottle about 20 milligrams of CBD you can get from 12 full drops of oil now this particular product once again we have a lot of people coming to us with more advanced health challenges their doctors have recommended them to get a larger amount of CBD this is the product that we turn to we also have some folks that are wanting to maintain a consistent daily dose but at a lower amount of oil so you could maintain something like that with this product it has a very long shelf life looking at two years on this guy so you'd really be able to keep it in a cold dark place for a very long time to keep a consistent daily dose of CBD in a smaller capacity like that once again the 5000 milligram of our full-spectrum daily oil 84 milligrams of CBD per press so if you have any questions about this or any other ambery Gardens product you can feel free to reach

Hope you're having a great day. It's Sunday for us.We just enjoyed a nice\nbreakfast here at Vintage cafe and crepas.. And... Not bad at all! Pretty darn good!...So here's the interesting thing...I really have no idea what we're gonna vlog about\ntoday. Do you have any ideas? Just life I guess. And see what happens...Let's see what the brings...We're good at that!... Well somebody needs a haircut\nand we bought this here at the bodega. And there wasn't a price on the shelf. So....\nI ended up paying like twenty-five dollars for this. I was thinking it might be like ten. Even\nthough we have some at Beck's mom's house. We thought... Yeah! Let's give her a\nhaircut here. The interesting thing is going to be seeing how the return process\nworks. I do have a receipt. Okay! well it looks like we're just gonna get in-house\ncredit! And yeah.... 20, 25 bucks no big deal! Because we do come to this Bodega quite\noften. Because they have a little bit of everything here. You know a lot of the\nstuff in this store is a.... Looks like it comes from Walmart. They have\neverything from scooters, washing machines and I think a great value is\nlike a Walmart brand. This is something quite fascinating! Every time an employee\nbuys something like a pack of gum or a drink, they scored it with a shot a\nspray-paint. I guess it's an effective way to secure your inventory. Well concerns have been expressed that\nthe toilet paper we bought last time is a bit rough. And this is the stuff we got\nfor twenty one pesos. And I have no idea what is gonna be better unless I use\nprice as like a factor. I don't know! This stuff is ahhh.... 20 peso! Sometimes you just have to live on the edge when it comes to toilet paper. I really would like to\ncheck this place out...They look closed because it's Sunday...Volunteers without limits! We spend enough time here that we would like to do some volunteer work and sometimes it can be tough\nfinding out where to. But we were referred to this place but... It's Sunday\nand they're not open! We'll have to come back. Look at all those motorcycles...Wow! Beautiful motorcycles to. You know this place is always busy. We\nneed to eat here one day. I'm like totally not hungry now but they're\nalways busy..... Good stuff! Guys this is a really.... Thank you for shaking on me!... Nice day here in San Felipe and the dogs need to get out and play.\nShelby, she's just gonna sand bathe. The dynamic between these dogs is pretty funny because the Springer, Gabe he loves to swim. The Border Collie Sichael, he will\nonly go out about to his chest. And then he gets all jealous that the puppies are\nout there. And just.... It's just a big game with these dogs!\nAnd then Shelby just likes hanging out on the beach. So this is all just a\nlittle bit of hearsay from, I think it was like Victor and Lily. But I guess at\none point they were anticipating cruise ships coming to San Felipe.So.... Some of\nthese ahhhh... Kind of more resort skyscraper looking buildings were developed and\nthen it got canceled out. So.... There's a lot of half-finished hotels. I,  It's like\na double-edged sword you know! You think it would be great for the economy for some cruise ships to come in. But yet it would change the whole dynamic of the town and probably take away some of the charm! Well we're gonna round this afternoon\nout with a trip to the sweet spot.They're not always open but Monica yesterday\nsaid that they have really good margaritas! You guys are a salt on the rim type of\nperson or a no salt? I just love that contrast with the salt... Well you gotta get a little sampler platter to soak up the alcohol. This little dog\nis getting mighty hungry right now! She's taking a couple whips off just in the\nhopes that she'll get some food. I am so glad we ordered a little bit of food...\nBecause these guys, they snuck some alcohol into that picture Margherita's!...Oh oh! Mom's intoxicated! Fortunately grandma had some dog food in her trunk. We attained the monster! Mom what are you doing ordering a whole slab of ribs?...That's what we are having for dinner....We are hungry! Seriously this has to be the best\nhomemade potato salad I've had in a long time! I think mom just didn't want us\ndriving intoxicated. So she knew we had to like soak up the alcohol! Wow! And we also just totally hung out with\nVincent the chef here...He's awesome...Yeah....The Sweet Spot.... Worth your ahhhh... Stop here in San Felipe! Alright guys! I got to give you a shout-out on my youtube channel because this food is great! We have Vincent.... What's happening?....DeAndre!...\nDeAndre... Quincy and this is the guy that adds tequila to those margaritas.\nHey! Great meal guys! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you for coming...You gotta love leftovers...I like the oranges...And grandma wants the oranges. I'm not safe to drive right now! That CBD oil must\nreally be giving her the munchies. Because.... Shelby has not let up.She is\nwanting all of what we are having... Our dog is a weed freak!...There's worse things to be in life.... But on\na very serious note! We have started Shelby be on CBD oil. Which is the\nnon-intoxicating, anti inflammatory aspect of hemp or marijuana whatever...And she has like an autoimmune condition with her spinal cord where it's all\ninflamed. And it has just been amazing! We've seen this burst of life come back\nto her personality! Like she's getting into shit and stirring up trouble. That's\nthe Shelby we know and love!...Like before she wouldn't be stirring stuff up! Like\nit really warms our heart to know that this CBDoil D oil... CBD oil is really\nhelping her. And if you guys have a dog with some type of an issue related to\ninflammation, I would highly recommend giving it a shot! And you can get it in\nall 50 states guys.... I think we found our designated driver! Ah Sitka, He's a good boy! Well, when the music is good and the\nseats are comfortable and the margaritas taste good.... There's just no reason to go\nhome! So.... We're gonna finish out here for the\nday. But be sure to hit that subscribe button because I'm sure we're gonna be\nup to something fun tomorrow! And....Thanks for joining us!

research continues to emerge pet parents and veterinarians alike are finding that CBD can provide positive benefits for dogs as well whether a dog has cancer seizures or anxiety cannabis oil can serve as an alternative medication to help treat symptoms here's everything pet parents need to know about cannabis oil for dogs as with any pet wellness trend when it comes to CBD oil for dogs there's a lot of information floating around online of course you want to do what's best for your pup which leads to the question what do I need to know about CBD oil what is CBD oil CBD oil as liquid derived from the marijuana plant there are many ways to extract oil from the plant including co2 extraction the marijuana flower contains trichomes which are glands that have essential oils once the glands are separated from the plant they can be formulated to find the ideal ratio of cannabinoids marijuana plants contain 80 different cannabinoids including THC tetrahydrocannabinol the psychoactive component and CBD cannabidiol the medical component when you use cannabinoids together it's more effective than separately research says of the entourage effect offered by cannabis hemp products on their own contain less than 0.3 percent THC dr. gary richter owner and medical director of Montclair veterinary hospital in Oakland California points out that cannabis oil has no psychoactive effect on dogs when dosed properly depending on the nature of the product if it contains little or no THC then the dog is not going to get high what is CBD oil for dogs cannabidiol is one of the active compounds found in hemp it has a number of healing properties for humans and animals alike CBD is not to be confused with the more well-known major active hemp compound tetrahydrocannabinol or THC THC as the compound in hemp that gives it its psychoactive properties making it popular for recreational use CBD has no psychoactive properties in fact if you're buying high-quality CBD products the CBD that you give to your dog will have never even come into contact with THC CBD oil as a highly concentrated form of CBD made by placing a solvent like olive oil or alcohol on the surface of a hemp plant the plant absorbs the solvent and as it makes its way through the plant it absorbs a high concentration of the CBD compound the oil is then harvested and processed to create an all-natural non-toxic product that can improve your dog's well-being what are the benefits of CBD oil for dogs CBD oil can be used to treat seizures nausea stress anxiety arthritis back pain symptoms of cancer and gastrointestinal issues among other health conditions in dogs relief is provided as the cannabinoids in marijuana interact with the endocannabinoid system Shu explains it's a series of receptors that run throughout the body he says the cannabinoids interact with the receptors in the body and modulate things like pain anxiety and nausea unlike some traditional pain medicine for dogs medical cannabis has no life-threatening side effects with proper dosage Shu points out it doesn't damage the kidney liver or GI tract the dogs aren't high or sedated the AKC canine health foundation CHF is sponsoring a study through the Colorado State University's College of Veterinary Medicine & biomedical sciences that will evaluate the use of CBD in treatment resistant epileptic dogs the CHF hopes that this will be the first study to gain scientific data on the use of CBD in dogs with this condition how does CBD oil work cannabidiol works by supplementing your endocannabinoid system or ECS this system is responsible for regulating bodily functions like immunity sleep appetite mood and pain it's made up of neurons in your brain called cannabinoid receptors non THC strains of CBD stimulate these neurons without producing a psychoactive effect you get the health benefits of hemp without the high humans cats ducks as well as birds reptiles and mammals share this system which is why they are all able to benefit from the effects of CBD CBD and more specifically CBD oils work similar to the way of vitamin works taking a vitamin E supplements to the benefit of your circulatory system by increasing your body's vitamin E supply CBD oils do just the same for your ECS which is why it helps regulate mood pain and sleep for those with chronic health issues while the idea of giving your pet CBD oil may seem foreign it's very similar to you taking a vitamin CBD for anxiety and depression the most well known benefit of CBD in both humans and animals as its ability to help manage conditions such as anxiety and depression if your dog has issues with chewing urinating pacing or other destructive behaviors then it's most likely a symptom of anxiety in your pet chronic anxiety and depression are generally the result of a hormonal imbalance in humans but works differently in dogs chronic anxiety in dogs is a Feist collage achill problem problem that is caused by behavior this imbalance can

means it won't produce up high research on cbd as in its early stages but some studies and anecdotal evidence have found that it may be helpful in treating conditions like anxiety pain cancer and arthritis cbd pet products are marketed as a natural way to treat these conditions in dogs making pet owners curious a recent survey of 2131 participants conducted by the vin news service found that 63 percent of veterinarians reported that they were asked about cbd oil for pets at least once a month but veterinarians aren't always willing to discuss it those who advise clients on using cbd for their pets can risk penalties and license suspension in some states in other states veterinarians have a little more freedom california recently passed a law that prevents state regulators from penalizing veterinarians for talking with clients about using cannabis for their pets including potential side effects and toxicities other bills like this are in the works but for now don't expect your veterinarian to recommend cbd products and definitely don't expect a prescription even in states where medicinal cannabis is legal the existing laws only allow for a human health care provider to prescribe cannabis to people they don't authorize veterinarians to administer dispense prescribe or recommend such products for use in animal patients research done on cbd and humans has shown that it may be effective in treating epilepsy anxiety irritable bowel disease ibd and chronic pain but only a few reliable studies have been done on the effects of cbd in dogs one study from 2018 trusted source sought to assess safety anti-inflammatory properties and anti-pain properties of a cbd oil in dogs with osteoarthritis researchers gave dogs doses of two or eight milligrams mg per kilogram kilogram a body weight eighty percent of the dogs showed improvement in their pain and mobility as measured by two veterinary resources the canine brief pain inventory and the hudson activity scale however it's important to note that this study was funded by a cbd producer so the results may be biased a small study published in 2019 trusted source found that epileptic dogs given cbd in addition to seizure medication had significantly fewer seizures than those that received seizure medication in a placebo however similar numbers of dogs in both the cbd group and the placebo group responded to treatment and had decreases in seizure activity the authors recommended further testing before reaching any definitive conclusions while these studies and others like them could give a window into cbd's medicinal potential for dogs more studies are needed to confirm this research the previously referenced 2018 study on dogs with osteoarthritis showed that the most effective dose for increasing the dog's comfort and activity levels was 2 milligrams per kilogram of weight however because this study may be biased and because other data on cbd dosage for dogs as sparse this shouldn't be considered a dosing recommendation every dog will respond differently which is why it's important to start with a small dose monitor your pet's results and adjust from there most products will offer dosing suggestions but keep in mind that these are developed by the manufacturer if you give cbd to your dog watch for signs of a positive or negative reaction for example if you give cbd to your dog 20 minutes before a firework show and you find them lying comfortably during the festivities when they'd otherwise be cowering under a bed the cbd has probably been effective or if your dog's arthritis has been causing mobility issues and after about a week of cbd they're able to run and jump like they used to chances are high it's doing something as for negative effects look for excessive panting lethargy vomiting dribbling urine and loss of balance if your pet is exhibiting any of these symptoms they may have consumed too much and may be experiencing toxic effects in this case it's best to visit your veterinarian they'll be able to help you regardless of whether they're willing to discuss cbd with you if your pets use prescription medications be sure to ask your veterinarian for medical advice to ensure cbd products won't cause any negative side effects or otherwise interact with their medication consult a vet for informational purposes before administering cbd or hemp

you can see it's gonna be about this seaweedy oil for pets um chanel is really old she's been in my family for seven years but before that we have no idea how long she was alive for because we brought her in the streets she just popped up in their lives but um so about two months ago sorry super posted up with you guys about two months ago she stopped being able to get around this easy helmet it was really hard cuz my parents they walked they both work all day so if they left her on the bed they would get back home to her freaking out because she had been stuck on someone spent all day you know she wasn't able to get down and go get her food her water um we have we live in a two-story house she just couldn't get around anymore so I reached out to this company Bailey CEO oil and I told them that I think my dogs would be like super good candidates to like review this product because Chanel was in a position where like I would be able to see whether this worked on on their website and I saw so many reviews of people saying you know my dog had back pains and he couldn't hop or he couldn't even walk up the stairs anymore and all that his six now so you know that seems very promising and just crazy honestly I just you know there's no this is not back McCain meds for dogs this is seaweed oil and literally I would say my mom started singing within two three weeks she started noticing Chanel can hop up on the bed again which is it's crazy to me like she literally just came running up and down the stairs again like um and yeah it's just it's helped her so much you know little she's a little dog she's a teacup Yorkie and when little dogs get older they get so many hip problems I don't know what that is that's what somebody told me right um yeah honestly this this has helped her so much it's just crazy to me that my talking she literally just was not hopping up on the bed she couldn't go up the stairs it was just a mess and she's back just from taking this right here it says you want to give him two drops per per 10 pounds as you just saw she's probably not even forward um she's super little so I'll just give her one drop um I didn't start giving this to my other dog until like last week because I always just from the reviews I just kept to myself I don't know why I thought that it was like merely for old dogs so that they you know aged better but I was looking up what the CBD effects and benefits are on dogs and it even helps them with anxiety guys which is crazy like there's there's literally dogs on inside meds you know I know some and I just bambina my other dog she said she'll be nice she's literally spazzing anyone will tell you she's don't anxious like she's always shaking he's really scary she's okay she's okay she's healthy but so I'm gonna start using this on her and I'll update you guys on how it helps her but honestly like I wouldn't recommend this to all the families I know with not just older dogs like I said but younger dogs too because it is it's supposed to access he's four complete balanced diet you know but yeah I should totally give this a try if you have older dogs if you have younger dogs just it's honestly just for a complete balanced diet look into it go if you don't believe me go on their website go read the testimonies from all the other dog owners who literally have witness what I witness you know so again thank you so much Bailey CBD oil know this has helped our family so much she's not really like my best friend she was my first dog and my mom told me she couldn't walk anymore the stairs it

[Music] [Music] z 5 000 milligrams that was my own slow motion effects let me know how i did this is my uh 5 000 milligrams of the cotton candy oh my god oh my god i've been waiting on this i've been waiting on this one black tie has some of the best tissue that i've had period i am a fan i am an absolute fan of their lemon ginger they have a lemon ginger tincture that is amazing uh also they have a they have an espresso tincture that i really like i put the espresso tincture in my coffee it's time for the murder knife again to get this little plastic thing off this little whatever that is get that off it was really giving me problems it was really giving me problems okay so i was saying that they have an espresso tincture that i really like i put the espresso tincture in my coffee um the lemon ginger tea tincture one it tastes really good on the tongue under the tongue it has a nice flavor to it the espresso does too it really tastes like coffee that's why i just drop it in the coffee but trip off this i like the lemon ginger tincture and i put drops of that i put that in my whisky it's amazing i put that lemon ginger tincture in my jack daniel's whiskey and voila you now have cbd infused whiskey thank me later okay but we are here for the full spectrum 5000 milligram cotton candy tincture now a lot of people ask me what do i do about how do i handle my anxiety during the day and being that i can't smoke during the day well i could now because i'm off work right uh but when i was working you know you can't smoke during the day or at least i couldn't i guess you could if you had a crate but something about smoking during the day makes me a little bit lazy but i can take the tinctures and i am focused the anxiety comes down i am ready to go into the meeting i was in uh an account executive for the company that i worked for in nashville constantly in meetings constantly speaking to people and in front of people drove my anxiety crazy uh but as long as i had me some tincture on hand like if i get ready to go into a building uh to speak to one of the facilities managers or something like that i could take a couple drops of tincture voila good to go great if i'm getting ready to have a meeting i could use the tincture i know within about five or ten minutes it's gonna kick in calm me completely down and have me ready for the meeting so one i know the tincture works i love that i'm more here for the taste i'm going to tell you about the fix as well but i want to know how good this tastes because the effects i know tincture is great for anxiety absolutely one hundred percent i love tincture for anxiety we're going to read the dosage it says start with a half a dropper half of one of these wait for the effects to begin increase as desired for optimum results for best application drop in mouth hold for 20 seconds before swallowing that is the best device i've i've seen people who have used the tincture they'll take the tincture swallowed done done and they're wondering why the effects haven't kicked in or why it's taking so long for the best effects with this tincture like i said start with the half a dropper i'm gonna start with i could do a whole drop but i'm gonna follow the directions i'm gonna start with the half a dropper wait 15 to 20 seconds it says 20. wait 15 to 20 seconds before you swallow then give it a minute so let's do that i'm excited i'm excited black tie has really done a great job with the flavors like i said that uh the espresso really tastes like coffee the lemon ginger you can really taste the lemon and the ginger in it and this is the 5 000 milligram cotton candy now it says start with a half since i've used tincture before i'm gonna use a whole dropper okay let's go up under the tongue i don't put mine on top of the tongue go up under the tongue [Music] [Music] okay okay okay now i'm going to talk about the taste water fix again needless to say needless to say if you don't like cotton candy this is 100 a no for you you're not gonna like it you can definitely definitely taste the cotton candy taste which is kind of you know cotton candy-ish to say the least like how do you explain cotton candy to someone who's never can't have cotton candy no more who's never had cotton candy um it's like trying to describe pizza to someone who's never had it cotton candy is sweet it is i wish pink was a flavor because it when you think cotton candy you think about the pink one yeah comes in different colors but you know when you think cotton candy you automatically like pink cotton candy it's sweet um it's a candy taste uh it's sweet it's candy doesn't taste like cotton at all like my shirt is 100 cotton and it does not taste like my shirt tastes way better so it's sweet and candy-ish um it does it does have a bit of an aftertaste it the aftertaste is more hmm the aftertaste has like like a like a tart taste to it like you know the cotton candy comes in strong boom in your face the aftertaste i would have to say that aftertaste tastes more like cotton like just a just like a a funny little aftertaste not a not a nasty taste per se or no or a bad taste or anything like that but it does have an aftertaste um but the cotton candy part of it the sweetness of it it makes me want to take another dropper full it does it really does it makes me want to take another dropper because yeah i like that that taste i'm gonna tell you what else it says on here let me put this back on there good before i spill my [ __ ] tincture it says black tie tinctures are made with full spectrum hemp oil made from pesticide free industrial hemp and mct oil medium chain triglycerides we use mct oil so the cannabinoids absorb as effectively as possible into your system this full spectrum tincture contains a full range of cannabinoids such as cbd cbn cbg cbda as well as citrus terpenes that's the aftertaste it's kind of tart like it was tart it's it it i guess i would consider that kind of citrusy because it it it's like it wants to be citrus but you know how have you had an orange that wasn't completely like super sweet yet it doesn't taste bad it's just not sweet you can taste the orange and tartness of the orange but it just doesn't have that sweetness that's the aftertaste that must be those citrus terpenes because it's kind of tart not really sweet citrus terpenes just the tart citrus terpenes but i love the fact that it has cbd cbn cbg and cbda as well and now that i've been talking for a second it's kicking in it's kicking in it's a it's it's calming it is like i said it this is this is what i'm used to i'm used to being able to like i would be in my i'll be in my work vehicle before i get ready to go into a building to go have a meeting or to go talk with someone i do a dab of tincture fix my face make sure i don't got anything in my nose or anything you know that's embarrassing when you got a a booger or some snot in your nose or something uh so i was sitting in the car i would do that take my tincture check myself out in the mirror make sure i'm good to go swag then i would go in and have my meeting and by the time i would go in and get ready to have the meeting the tincture has kicked in and i'm calm i'm good to go i'm ready to interact with other human beings and talk sophisticatedly and i feel good i feel a little uh here's the thing about tinctures tinctures don't make me lazy like making sure that i have a sativa or an indica you know you want that sativa that's going to give you that upbeat feeling indicators will give you more of a chill relaxed lazy feel with with uh tinctures you don't have to worry about that it keeps you in a good mood uh it's gonna calm you down it's gonna calm that anxiety tremendously and you're just gonna be good to go i definitely definitely uh if you're into tinctures now i know some people who just do not fool with tinctures at all at all and that's all right they just prefer to have this the flower to smoke hey cheers to you my dear friend but to those of you who are looking for something to use during the day or those of you who can't smoke or have a friend or someone that would love to get into cbd uh for the uh medical uh benefits of it but they just don't want to be smoking the tincture is the way to go it will definitely do the job it's going to calm that anxiety and you're going to be feeling great like don't do the tiger you did salute as we say on smoking legal keep it positive or keep it pushing keep it positive or keep it pushing a more", "-0Vz-JD7gsw": "so hi in thanks for watching in this video we're gonna cover the topic can I give my dog human CBD oil so I'm gonna answer that question for you but stick around to the end of this video because I do have a really good recommendation for you so I'm Blake Armstrong and that's a picture of my dog Rosie and I run the informational website cannabis supplements for pets so if you have any other questions or you want some information about CBD for dogs certainly head over to that informational website so here we're talking can you give your pet human CBD oil and what we refer to as human CBD oil might just be CBD oil that you order online or you buy at a local shop that's really marketed and designed for humans so the dosage would be you know dosage for an adult and so on and the reason this question comes up a lot is that many people use CBD for themselves they see some of the benefits then they hear about the benefits that CBD has for pets and you know their dog might be getting older with arthritis or might have some anxiety issues so they want to try CBD on their pets so that's a really common question and comes up a lot now the answer is yes it's possible to give your dog human CBD oil and here's why your dog or cat along with most other mammals actually has the same system to process cannabinoids that you have now this system is known as the endocannabinoid system and it helps moderate a whole variety of bodily processes using endocannabinoids so the CBD and other compounds found in CBD supplements stimulate this system by either activating or blocking the group of receptors it contains and this is true for us humans for dogs cats horses and most other mammals so there are some things to remember when giving your dog human CBD oil or CBD oil that isn't really designated or designed for pets and the first major thing to remember and consider is dosage so most importantly you really want to know how to dose the oil and which way to administer it in order to ensure it delivers the effects that you are expecting so we've created a whole video on CBD dosage for dogs you know using pet CBD oil it's a really really common question how much CBD oil should I give my dog so you can find that video and even download a full resource and a whole checklist in the description below this video that we're watching right now now CBD is a non toxic compound meaning it won't produce any serious side effects should you give your dog too much of it however CBD is known to have sedate of like effects in high doses this can lead to things like your dog feeling sleepy or lethargic but it's not permanent so the best way to work out your dog's dosage is using their body weight so here's an outline of three different dosage strengths low medium and high you can use to help you dose your human CBD oil for your dog so in this example we're just going to do the low dose formulation now when you're using CBD oil it's always best to start with a low dose and then sort of work your way up as you sort of progress over ten days or perhaps two weeks so if you're not seeing any results with a low dose and certainly consider upping the dose a little bit every ten days or every few weeks or so so in this example we're gonna use the first bullet point there and I'm gonna run through this formula with you now if you want to reference this at all you can find a link that links to the whole report on this topic in the YouTube description below this video so that first bullet point reads 0.5 milligrams of CBD for every half kilogram of bodyweight so in order to get an exact dose you'll want to take the total strength of your CBD oil and divide it by the total amount of oil in the pack or in the bottle now this tell you how much CBD is in one milliliter of oil so for example a 30 milliliter bottle of a hundred and 25 milligram CBD oil contains four point one six milligrams of CBD per milliliter so these are measurements that you should probably be able to see either on the box of the CBD either on the dropper itself or perhaps you know on the website where you ordered your CBD oil so in this example 125 milligrams divided by 30 milliliters equals four point one six milligrams per milliliter now given that a single drop from a dropper holds roughly point zero five milliliters you can calculate that a single drop of oil contains point two milligrams of CBD in this given example so you take the calculation from before the four point one six milligrams times point zero five milliliter and you get point two milligrams of CBD per drop so from there you work out how many drops of oil your dog needs based on his body weight so for example a 30 kilogram Labrador would need 15 drops of the oil that we referenced in this example now a 10 kilogram French Bulldog on the other hand would need only five drops now I know the calculation can get confusing but here it is 0.5 milligrams of CBD for every half kilogram of body weight in the example we've got a 30 kilogram dog so we do point zero five milligrams times 60 which is three divided by 0.2 milligrams per drop equals 15 drop so a low dose recommendation for a 30 kilogram dog using a 30 milliliter bottle of a hundred and twenty five milligrams of CBD oil would be 15 drops so you would take that 15 drops and sometimes it's recommended to do sort of maybe 7:00 in the morning and then 8:00 at night and do that for 10 days two weeks and if you're not seeing results and certainly go to the medium or the higher dose recommendation now there are online calculators you can maybe search on Google and find a CBD dosage calculator and basically they will give you the same answer if you plug in you know how many milliliters of a bottle you have and then how much milligrams of CBD is in that bottle and so forth you'll come up with a calculation just like this one now I have a suggestion you should keep things simple and safe and just use CBD pet products so I've shown you that this is possible to give your pet regular human CBD oil and if you're just like me you're looking at that calculation and you're probably sweating it's a bit confusing and it's certainly not something that you know I would personally want to do and I don't really recommend that you take your human CBD oil and try to go through that calculation although you certainly can it is possible to do now one other thing worth mentioning here is that we are assuming that your CBD oil in these examples has very low traces of THC or actually has zero THC to much THC can produce very harsh side effects in pets and if you want more information on this you can check out a link in the description for my report on THC for dogs but if you're really interested in giving your dog CBD as a regular part of their diet and health scheme I do recommend that you just stick to CBD pet products we run a Facebook group and we're getting success stories on a daily basis of people using pet CBD products helping their dogs with anxiety arthritis reducing the amount of seizures it certainly doesn't work on every single dog but you know the majority of dogs are seeing really great results and if you use your human CBD oil I can guarantee you that you know once you run out you're going to want to use some more CBD and I just suggest that right from the beginning just keep it simple and use CBD from a pet CBD company and one of the great reasons to do this is that pet CBD brands make dosage so simple one of the biggest questions or the most often asked questions in our face group group or people email me or they ask and they come to our website is how much CBD should I give my dog dosage is a big question and it can get confusing but if you're just not you know using pet CBD oil it can get confusing if you use a a popular and a well-respected pet CBD brand you're gonna get dosage charts like the ones we have on the screen here so basically you order the CBD oil and a chart comes with your oil and it says you know if your pet is under 30 pounds this is exactly how much CBD oil we recommend if your pet weighs you know sixty pounds and above this is what we recommend so you can find charts like this I'm actually gonna go over to one example on a website here and basically this dosage chart is for a company called holistic ette it's a recommended brand and they would recommend that for dogs under 20 pounds you would want to get their CBD pet tincture a hundred and fifty milligrams so that's the strength and basically you just go down so if you've got a terrier that maybe weighs 16 pounds they recommend eight drops it's that easy and if you don't see results after maybe ten to two week ten days to two weeks then up it to the stronger dose which is double that so sixteen drops so maybe 8:00 in the morning 8:00 and night now if you have a larger dog they have a dosage chart recommendation for larger dogs so you can get the next one up which is the three hundred milligram bottle so for medium pets between 20 pounds and sixty pounds and say you know you've got a a Labrador maybe that weighs around fifty eight pounds then the dosage recommendation here is 14 and a half drop so it's very easy to use and you get an exact dosage so you can feel confident that you're giving the right amount of CBD to your dog now if you need more information on these types of brands or you know how to administer CBD oil or any other type of CBD dog related questions certainly head over to our informational website cannabis supplements for pets and what I've actually done for you is below this YouTube video you'll find a link to the top recommended CBD oil brand for pets that I'm recommending right now and I'm not gonna mention the brand here because I actually keep this link updated we review various CBD brands ourselves on our own pets we've got our large Facebook community and I'm talking with pet owners on a daily basis I've been emailing many of them and we've got thousands that come and visit our website so we're getting a lot of feedback and at the moment our top CBD oil recommendation you can find that in the link below this video so I highly recommend that you know if you're thinking about using CBD on your dog or on your cat certainly go with a pet CBD company now if you found this video useful I would recommend that you subscribe to our YouTube channel we're coming out with more CBD pet related videos on a regular basis and you can see some other related videos up on the screen right now related to dosage and some other ailments as well so I hope you found this video useful and if you are using CBD with your pet I hope that you get some great results", "CaXODxgOGoc": "today's video is all about using CBD oil to treat epilepsy in dogs does it really work okay so let's get on to the first question and the first one is from pail who's got a seven month old beagle who says for the last month he started to get seizure attacks and within the last two months he's had six at six seizures six attacks and he's asking can I help him know how he can use CBD oil to treat these seizures what amount should be given any brands that I can recommend you know and can they can can I recommend which CBD law would be best to help this dog so the first thing I'm going to say is that we really need to try and determine the cause of the seizures so I'm Steve's can be caused by a number of different things it can be caused by organ disease infections poisoning brain lesions and then epilepsy so in a younger dog epilepsy is definitely one of the the main differentials although this one is quite young normally epilepsy starts maybe from about about a year old although it can be from six months so it certainly fits in from from that point of view now if we're talking about epilepsy as a whole then you know we also need to think about when do we want to start treatments for these seizures so generally that's if a dog has had two or more seizures in a six-month period certainly if they're having more than one seizure a month we also want to think about treating them if they've not recovered I'm between seizures or if they're having severe seizures or if the recovery in general is very long so that's kind of some triggers to start treatment and if the seizures aren't caused by epilepsy then we really need to try and address the underlying cause so we also get developmental problems so anatomical problems in younger dogs so that can be things like fluid on the brain water on the brain and you know we need to kind of be addressing those causes it could be a liver shunt or something like that which can also cause seizures so we don't want to assume that just because it is a young dog and maybe they otherwise seem to be pretty normal that epilepsy is the cause you know we also need to think about trying to find out the underlying cause because if it's not epilepsy then often they won't respond as well to anti-seizure medication alone we all need to give other things give other drugs use other interventions and to try and get these these pet seizure free or certainly to reduce the frequency in the severity of these seizures now next when we're thinking about treating seizures we need to think about choosing the best anti-seizure medication for that individual so with drugs like phenobarbital and epitone you know they're our first line of frontline drugs that we use to treat certainly epilepsy in dogs you know we know how effective they can be we know what to expect with long-term administration we know how to monitor for potential side effects you know and that's really important so if we think of CBD oil then research actually into it's used to control seizures it's just in its early stage there are some current investigations going on some current studies being run but you know we don't know exactly the details yet we don't know which dogs they're going to be most effective in do we need to use the CBD oil with additional medication and are there concerns with giving it will it actually make things worse you know are there side effects that we need to know about so although you know these studies are starting to run we need to think about why we're going to try a drug that we don't know how you know we don't know much about we don't know how well it's going to work and all those other things you know why are we thinking about using a drug like that when we've got other drugs in our arsenal if you like to treat seizures and certainly to treat epilepsy so we need to be clear you know there's a lot of information online there's a lot of hype there's a lots of people who are very enthusiastic about the use of CBD oil and about its treatment for any number of conditions from epilepsy certainly one from arthritis and pain and we've actually got a little bit of information about its use as a painkiller from an antique anti-cancer drug for an anti-allergy drug from an anti-anxiety point of view you know CBD oil is being touted as the next big thing to treat pretty much anything we really need to be careful if you want to know more about this topic than I've actually written about it in a lot of detail check out the show notes for the links links to that article and that talks about yeah the use of CBD oil in the treatment of seizures but also anxiety arthritis and cancer and I've also got another article about the risk of marijuana so if you're thinking well medical marijuana might be an option well you know that's something we really need to consider because actually the THC in that can be dangerous so you definitely need to need to know about that if you're thinking of using any kind of medicinal marijuana products so you know that's something to think about as for what dose to use you know and what supply to use you know supplies really going to depend on where you are in the world we definitely want to be if you're thinking of using a CBD oil we definitely want to be using a product that has had some independent analysis done to confirm that actually it's got what it says it's got and it's got low to zero THC in it I'm you know and that's gonna vary depending on where you are in the world so I wouldn't like to give you any kind of brand and as for dose you know I make a point of actually never giving doses for drugs because I don't think that's the place for me I don't think it's the place for anyone online I think dosing an individual treatment plan should be overseen and recommended by an individual vet after examining that patient I think that's the only sensible way that's the only safe way to go about treating an individual so you know I certainly make a point of never giving doses but you know I hope that gives you something to think about if you are thinking about using CBD or to treat any form of seizures certainly the treatment of epilepsy you've been watching the doctor Alex

Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "Po_A65Psphc": "Green remedy CBD oil for pets our our hemp

"n_chrAaWtf0": "but the first product we launched was a new 250 milligram CBD oil specifically for cats and dogs okay this is a product that has the whole hemp extract in it so you're getting the full it's a full spectrum oil it's 250 milligrams and it's naturally flavored with bait you know it's a natural bacon flavor so you know I'm getting into the pet market you know we've decided and we've committed that you know we believe that the CBD pet market is going to be one of the next you know one of the next biggest industries with CBD it's a huge trend right now you know we live in Vegas where you know there's there's a dispensary almost on every corner and you know it's a trend I mean they're putting oil in there you know pet oil in their dispensaries and it's amazing to watch I was just at a dispensary the other day it was a 150 milligram oil specifically for pets it was the full spectrum but it was $69 I've also seen some go for $99 and some even higher here we have a full spectrum oil 250 milligrams it's got natural bacon flavor and it's $39 and the whole the whole theory the whole idea guys is that you know your cats and your dogs have the same endocannabinoid system that humans do so what happens is when they you know when they take the product just like humans the cb1 and the cb2 receptor it affects the there's the cb2 receptors so they're wired the same way and it's it's acting as a natural anti-inflammatory so instead of going to the vet and having to pay you know crazy bills or go through surgery or some of the different things that's that's happening for a lot of you know pet owners they're able to take an unnatural product that is giving you know your pets the nutrition that they need and you know massive it's creating like massive life-changing results you know for our our pets that we love so much you know our our two dog Stella and Laila we give them the we give them the oil every night and they they love it they fight over the oil and we've we've noticed that with our with our older dog Stella she has a lot of anxiety and she's got like separation issues so if Layla's away from home or even if they're in a different room sometimes you know Stella has a lot of anxiety and she freaks out and you can't even hold her so when you hold her she just wants to get out of your arms right away and we've noticed that in the last two or three weeks since giving her this product she's like a totally different dog completely chill calm let's you hold her you can cuddle her snuggle her and she won't freak out like she used to and that end for us you know as small as that may sound it was it was kind of nice you know to be able to experience that with you know with our dogs so we're excited we're excited to see you guys get your product give it to your dogs give it to your cats and you there's just as an FYI there's a couple there's a couple ways to do it you can you can take the you can take the dropper and drop it in there water okay so sometimes we do that if we're if we're not giving it to them orally we're putting it you know we're dropping a full dropper in their water bowl and you know that's for dogs that you know I don't know maybe they don't want to you know they don't like the dropper or maybe they're sensitive to the dropper and you know maybe they're not as mindful as they're drinking their water so you drop it into their water and that's one way to do it we actually don't do it that way we give it two we give it to them orally every night so because it's flavored so well I just literally I stick it out there and we've got a really we've got a really funny video that maybe maybe general post online but literally our dogs are just sitting there and licking away as we're holding the dropper out and they're fighting over it so it's it's really hysterical but that's how we do it we just we put it right out there and they know every night that they're gonna get some and they can't wait for it they love it so that was the first product we launched and then the second product we launched was hemp works dog treats CBD dog treats guys let me just tell you let me bring this a little closer to the screen here so you guys can see it this was one of the most complex products that I've ever you know been a part of producing and manufacturing it was extremely complex to figure out how to make a CBD dog treat that number one tastes good but number two has the cbiit has this the full-spectrum CBD in it with no burn rate because the challenge you have with in the industry with CBD dog treats is anytime you know you're gonna bake something and you have moisture you know high temperatures there's a burn rate so you have to you have to get the product to the precise concentration so that when you have your finished product you know the the full you know milligram count is still there so so let me tell you a little bit about these dog treats you know what we do is we have our bulk CBD oil you know so the oil that we use in in you know the formulations you guys are used to and we take the oil and we have a manufacturing partner that is baking the oil into the treats now when I say fake if you can just picture a 105 foot tunnel oven it's its massive and all of the cookies are baked by hand these are not cookies that go into a machine in a facility or anything like these are these are baked the old-fashioned way okay they're they're they're oven baked and we're sourcing all local high quality ingredients so these are you know if your dog has a sensitive stomach these are grain free okay so there's there's no grain there's no gluten there's no corn there's no slowly so they're extremely healthy I'm going to read you guys on the back a couple things I'll read you like I said using all locally sourced ingredients there's no wheat no corn no soy no added sugars no salt no artificial preservatives note no glycerin no waxes no Hydra native oils so you're getting a product here your dogs that each cookie has two point five milligrams of active CBD and it's made in the USA so everything about this is a you know made in the USA nothing comes from from overseas you're giving your dog a healthy healthy treat throughout the day and they're getting CBD so what we do is we give our dogs one two two treats a day and then we give them the oil at night that's been our regimen and we've noticed a tremendous difference in our dogs so the shelf Tracey bass said shelf life of the trees so these are 18 months and the end the oils also 18 months okay so you know there's third there's 33 cookies in a bag and each cookie has two point five milligrams of active CBD now one thing I will say too is something we're really proud about and something that I that I think's really important is because of the burn rate issue you know with baking you know we wanted to make sure that that we got the right you know tests performed on the products so that we could tell our customers and tell our affiliates that hey we're being open we're being transparent and what you're paying for is exactly what you're getting so we're going to be posting a test on our website that shows that there is exactly the right amount of CBD in each treat basically what we say on the label is in the bag it's it's on you know it's in each tree and that's that's you know something that's really important to us so the treats are the same exact pricing as the oil okay so one bag is $39 okay so $39 a bag guys one thing I do want to say about these is the shipping cost on these is a little bit higher than our oils because this is much heavier a 24 pack of these comes in a 12 by 12 box a big box you order 24 of these it comes in a small box so you know you will notice you know that there is a little bit of a higher shipping costs on the treats because the packages are much much heavier but nevertheless you know I think you know here we got a product that's 100% natural its veterinarian formulated it's got you know two point five milligrams of active CBD it's priced well at $39 a bag and price lower if you buy you know a two pack or an eight pack or 24 pack and I mean guys this is a hot product how many people do you know having trouble with their pets and they're trying everything that's not working they're going to the pet store and they're buying all kinds of stuff you know you give them some treats and you give them some oil and something I'll tell you that you know I noticed is that you know we spend more money on our dogs than we do ourselves I mean we you know for the convention we just had you know Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday you know we stayed we stayed at the Rio and we were in one of the nicest Suites there at the Rio and when we went to pick up her dogs today the cost of their pet hotel was more than our hotel can you believe that we spent more money to board our dogs while we were away than we spent on ourselves at the hotel I believe that these products between the pet and the the treats and the oil I think they're going to be absolutely massive we're gonna start shipping these products globally as well we can't wait to see these products get on the shelves of every pet store in the world get into the hands of pet owners globally and really change lives not just for humans but now for pets as well so with that being said I

products a lot of people are asking how cbd oil is made and i'm out here in our certified organic hemp field to share this process with you from farm to label so here's what we do these plants that i'm standing in front of and standing behind these are usda certified organic hemp we're going to take the flowers off of this plant separate the flowers from the rest of the plant and we're going to extract the cbd oil out of those flowers with a certified organic sugarcane ethanol we're going to take that that that extract once the ethanol is evaporated out and we're going to blend that with an organic mct coconut oil to make our final product the cornbread hemp certified organic whole flour cbd oil now for our distilled cbd oil we take that another step further after we do the first pass of the extraction with the certified organic sugarcane ethanol we either then do a distillation process that purifies that extract into a honey golden color and makes a much more concentrated product that's also much more pure but still full spectrum to give you the benefits of the full spectrum cannabinoid profile without the earthy hempy taste so that's us at cornbread hemp and that's how you make cbd oil you", "sNXlWI88YjA": "hi everyone this is patti and this is our cat wilson say hi wilson hi how are you we're gonna do a video today on the hemp works products hi sweetie you just love my
