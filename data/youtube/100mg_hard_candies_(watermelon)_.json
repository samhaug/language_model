{"TGyQWqiG4Ns": "hi everyone so today I'm gonna be doing a review of the medicated hard candies it's from Canada's mo it's a hundred milligrams of THC flavors watermelon they threw it in my as an extra so this is a little bit exciting I've never done a hundred milligrams of like the hard candy I've done of that distilled or whatever it was but I'm kind of kind of wondering what this is gonna be like so let's rip it open let's see what I've had um like other candies from cannabis no and they're good just not this high of a milligram okay open in there oh okay well you know what cuz it's been so hot and it was probably in the mail like this it's all so it's four cubes which it would equal a hundred but these are look at they're stuck like I can't Oh well let's do okay I don't know this is not a I don't know how to do this okay how about okay so there's like I'll show you there's three pieces there's one two and then a little one I'm going to take the two bigger ones I think that's like 75 and we'll call this square with a little bit 25 so I'll hide wool I will save this one go back on the bag of gold I taste the THC you could taste the watermelon but you can also it's like a watermelon THC taste um so what I'm gonna do is I'll suck on this and whatever um I got a couple things I have to do and then when this kicks in I'll come back and I will let you go it guys know what it feels like it should be interesting it just should but yeah you taste the the more like I'm getting the more that it's like dissolving or whatever in my mouth not really tasting the watermelon so much I'm not mm-hmm it's THC there's a light to this right now but Jeff I was talking to somebody you would taste or they wouldn't you wouldn't taste it they would smell that the THC coming off there all right anyways I will come back when this is kicked in all right now the two are stuck together so maybe I don't I don't have I can't see the time from here I'll let you know hang on give me one second okay so it's quarter to four right now I'm gonna time this to see how long it takes to kick in also and I'll let you guys know so I'll be back when this kicks in okay this hasn't kicked in yet I still have so I'm on there what the hell I'll just I'll just take the other cube then they'll do there'll be a hundred milligram review on the hard candies watermelon from cannabis no here's the last piece look there's nothing else in there put it in there why not right okay I'll be back and this is kicked in and I'll tell you guys all about it but I guarantee you it should be good right probably but do that I aim well like the two the three I guess all together cuz there was only one cube left that's gone I just it's gone there goes the last piece that I put in so okay be back when this kicks in okay this hasn't kicked in yet but um okay it's all gone and I'm a little bit worried about one thing because I just I thought about it anyways so um like this morning I like I don't know by 8:00 I had oatmeal and I twelve I had a coffee and I have nothing in my system which I know it hits you harder and faster when you don't have anything in there which worries me because it's not like it's like you thirty milligrams or something and so anyways I had two pieces of this chocolate and I'm gonna have a yogurt because I don't this is not good don't do what Donna does eat first or have some I mean unless you want to get like it took hich fast I guess but um I'm a little bit worried about this because like I said there's nothing in there and anything that I had in my system is obviously gone so and now this is in there and there's like nothing well there's two pieces of chocolate now when there's like what is this peach yogurt that's going in there and I don't know what to do I'm hoping this slows it down a bit doesn't now I'm in panic mode and I just need to calm down a bit and hopefully this does the trick okay so I'm gonna finish my yogurt and I will come back when this when this kicks in remember to eat have some you don't have to eat wallet whatever but I don't have oatmeal at 8 o'clock in the morning and a coffee at 12 and take 100 milligrams enough stuff at quarter to 4 cuz there's nothing there okay anyways I will be back when this kicks in okay it's been an hour and I'm starting to feel this stuff and it's I am like I don't know what to do with myself but I need something to concentrate on or something cuz like um this gives you or me anyways it gives me like hi I'm very anxious I my anxiety I could just like you know when you have to sit down with stuff with a brown paper bag that's what I feel like I don't I don't know what I was thinking but it's too late now right so and I kind of feel like my eyes they probably don't but maybe like but they this is what they feel like to me they feel like they're like like a little bit like that but they're not but that's what they feel like so I figured I just tell you guys that took an hour to kick in and I'm a little bit edgy and I'm a little bit edgy and anxious not like anxiety wise like and paranoid too because I was just thinking I was looking outside I was like I should go out there no no I'm not going outside I'll I'll stay in here and if I do go outside the eyes will be covered because everybody will know and they're gonna be wondering what I'm taking because um just they're not gonna smell weed maybe I should throw them off after just like smoke of joy and they're like oh she's on she's on the weed and really among the edibles but then again maybe no because I don't know how long this stuff's supposed to last like it's just about five so [Music] maybe if it like tones down a bit and like say around 8:00 maybe then maybe I don't know I just know where see when I first try this I wasn't happy but now like even though I feel I don't know it's not really that great of a feeling but I'm still happy about it appears but I'm not I'm not happy about it I mean it's more concerning I'm concerned about the first stages of with me after you eat edibles wonder how many stages are I'm sure there's like a laughing stage and I guess the last stage would be you sleepy and you go to bed right so first stage of it for me is paranoia and like edgy and you know like you're happy but I don't I don't know how to describe it and okay so after this stage goes I will come back and we will well soon as our the next stage and holy [ __ ] I don't I don't know my my heart feels like it's going like likely fast okay so anyways I will be back there's this [ __ ] bear he's dead now that mosquito has been in like just around and it's the only one so not anymore in the garbage okay anyway so you guys don't really want to hear about that I'm going to wash my hands and wall I'll do that after and then I'll come back to the next stage I know I'll let you I'll let you know what stage that is okay so her on to the second stage and this stage is the happy stage you're still paranoid but you're more happy and you feel like doing things so I have to chop this this and mushrooms onion and then put them on what are these things called it skewers excuse skews well there's more than one so it'll be the earth there's already an S excuse excuse I don't know what the [ __ ] you're saying detected more than one so you said there's something I don't know you were in sizing I said it's a skewer ask you ask you I don't know what the [ __ ] it's called but I know I said skew or something and you said there's an urn and I said there's already nests and then I don't know if the [ __ ] we're even talking about ah you [ __ ] everything up do your video is it even recording [Music] you know the [ __ ] up thing is when she went to take this edibles she said I said marilla I [ __ ] that up eh before she did this she said oh I'll still do the barbecue I'll still I'll still put the shish kebab on the barbecue now what Donna no I have to do it she wanted to go outside oh and I should let them know that I'll be rolling one up you don't pay attention there you're not gonna have a thumb the real [ __ ] all up losers in boat rolling one up oh yes I told them I told them they like around eight I would roll one up but you know what you're so happy right now you say off frigate I'll just do it now so well not this second cuz I'm doing this but like soon sooner I can I wait till the wait til they till the truth the barbecue is like soap nobody can smell it right you're talking Ameer them you gonna cover up a joint maybe Luther maybe won't be doing it yeah it's gonna cover it up it will definitely yeah I remember now yeah I remember now I forgot I know we're talking about for a second well I know what we're talking about we're talking about doing [ __ ] when you're high and getting raising a joint here I cut for anybody did I stay with the honey shish kebobs in case you guys don't know I don't know I don't think I did I'm not sure and dead so you farting board that is you suffer I didn't girls don't fart okay don't fart like two o'clock in the morning oh you're sleeping and all time here I just like chopped them like this by the way if you can't scare I'm just like that way you can decide how much onion you want on it I don't even know I just cut the whole whole thing up because I'm not guessing today's not a guessing I guess everyday anyways yeah so the babies have any case I see me it's gonna be outside smoking a joint all the barbecues on take care of the smell and and that's it that's it for now this is the second stage I don't know what stage three is gonna entitle is that the word that goes there that's the word he used okay okay that's it see you at joint time yeah you see you at joint time hey no okay that's it that look at them mm-hmm if you guys are wondering why this is kind of hockey I'm using two cameras right now hey I'm holdin mine and I'm holding Donna's so I'm trying to get everything decided she was gonna do the shish kabobs and I don't have to cook so awesome [ __ ] awesome when I'm done this mm-hmm as you can see just switch it the other way well hey you will see some part of me I don't know which one yeah maybe it'll be a forehead or maybe it'll be an eye maybe it'll be the whole the whole thing who knows okay so this is the third stage and you feel really calm and yeah I can't put it down cuz I know you feel calm you just feel really good and relaxed and I'm not as paranoid as I was but I'll probably put on sunglasses when I go outside cuz just that part still there so yeah this is the third stage which is calm maybe by the time the the shish kebabs are done there will be like the hungry stage and then you could just normally eat how you would because you'd have the munchies and you wouldn't overeat and yeah so I got a roll a joint so I will when the next stage comes in I will tell you guys so we're in the gazebo there's a oh here hang on give a see you yeah okay so as daughter said we're going to light this up and she sitting in her chair I don't feel like I get a better shot for you guys here with the [ __ ] wind I needed some big guests any guests to come in Oh before I smoked this stage for is like the munchies but things taste better like you can chocolate tastes good like a dead fish in a fish out of water but without the flipping around oh you didn't even hit record that would have been bad there's Charlie I don't know why I do these things that's one of those don't do don't do what Donna does box goddamn curtains come see it's look [Music] take this for a second this is like this is like reefer madness cuz I know that this and that oh my god my you it's a movie I don't know what like is like you have too much I was gonna say refree provide relief ready yeah it's a thing I did you took long I took long I couldn't help it you were talking about reefer madness and then you said there's some reefer hidden or something what I gotta get to those sauces no I gotta get over there see where that barbecue is that's like yeah see that car because I'm not a barbecue I said see where that barbecue hasn't interfaces or that me instead of the barbecue see what that barbecue is I don't know what videos gonna go first this video or her video I don't know this woman oh you don't know this one's a Donna doesn't know because she doesn't even know what's going on I do I do in the past so before I even upload news no I'll be I gotta get to that thing I don't know how she's all paranoid and she wants to make a run for the BBQ but she doesn't want neighbors to know what she's go try the pants get hiked up all right Donna you ready on your mark get set No Go Go just wait remember you're filming name I know Mike I don't go drop in your phone in the barbecue I go put the phone down here so it's not up here and it won't cause it but I have to come back and get it Mike down here they're gonna see down here so you're gonna keep it down low okay just go nobody's looking at you go okay I'm over here now these are good um under there you can see they're coming along I feel like I should have like um something tasty cuz like is there still more of that cuz these have to be flipped okay anyways um I gotta get back over I gotta get back over here Shh I'm for doing this at school would you get right or right you should never do that in school would you get me no no oh my fingers they're probably look out the window see no lady not a creepy way old lady's like 80 not the little kids lady now you're a creepy old lady okay you know what what's I'm gonna stop this business right now yeah this little onstage anyways I'm gonna come back okay I gotta go so Stage five is the munchies yeah I'm like pretty bad no like this is really I'm telling you you could probably just [ __ ] eat and eat I'd be good if it was all like healthy food but bad if it wasn't you're not gonna find much healthy food around here I mean no shish kebab that's not all that healthy I don't think maybe well you got like your vegetables and our meat your protein so I think so you're not really thirsty but early hungry and I'll tell you what the next stage is when we I come upon it when you feel real good if you're into that what's that sure called it basketball [Laughter] mm-hmm those people you probably like this every night yeah if you're dive one of those people when you start Oh Donna sees me knocking [ __ ] around on her [ __ ] plate there without even knowing what's going on I mean you guys can't see it from my angle of course but it's free [ __ ] shish-kabob worried me right now if anybody's wondering that's Justin who just came in you were talking about stages mm-hmm and then I don't know neither do i oh I'll tell you in the next stage is okay so that's it for right now okay so this is um stage six and I don't know what to say about it she's [ __ ] and she's telling you guys all this stuff right now because there may not be an ending to the video if she doesn't tell you go ahead tell the truth daughter that's right that's why she might pass out did you feel like that you feel like you just you know close your eyes and go to sleep

up why do we now I just lost your buzz no anyways again anyways but it's good stuff she forgets what the [ __ ] she already said your ending the video so that's it that's all my", "GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "fX1Dq9T9pS8": "[Music] they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it on to a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background [Music] to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design [Music] once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an o avi and II a y/o and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops [Music] you", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "htlG9-jQyso": "hello and welcome to another episode of totally not Nigel I'm totally not Nigel your host [Music] today we're going to be looking at the fourth in our series of eight reviews of clays old-fashioned hard candies we looked at the horehound the anise and the green apple flavors now we're going to focus our attention like a laser OB mo on watermelon flavor that's right watermelon flavor hard candies now fair disclaimer I am NOT a fan of watermelon flavored candies because the artificial watermelon flavoring that they use in most cases is terrible and it is not very tasty whatsoever and no matter how they try to gussy it up it just never ever seems to be good but who knows occasionally you find an exception and perhaps today's review will prove my general theory about watermelon flavored candies incorrect there other flavors have been very good surprisingly even the anise flavor one which I didn't care for licorice flavors whatsoever even it was kind of fine probably be really awesome if you like that flavor so let's give this a try fans of watermelon flavored candies let me know in the comments below have you tried this do you like it I like it you wish it would go away let's give it a chef shall we now that we've opened it we'll give it a smell that artificial watermelon smell is not good not if another fan of that but it does smell a little like watermelon so if that's your thing yeah they got you they got you covered dense here we go we've got a little bit of a sugary coating on the outside of all of these probably helps them to keep from sticking to each other in the bag and it adds an extra little flavor component that being said this is one of the best artificial watermelon flavors I've ever tried it's actually quite pleasant which is amazing so I'm going to give this a very high recommendation actually even if you don't like watermelon flavored things your hosts include it's good it's refreshing it tastes kind of like watermelon which is shocked because a lot of times artificial watermelon flavor is know as bueno it's kind of like get by so close to Sandia not Guinea wait some more with this one yeah I like it yellow tartness to it a little body a little heft it reminds me very much of watermelon which is excellent a lot of watermelon candies don't like here's some passing tones of watermelon flavor and now onto the chemical portion of our program enjoy it suckers that this well done well done clays made a convert here I will reach for the Clay's watermelon whenever it's put out in that fancy little dish that people set around at the holiday time or any time of year so maybe in the summer watermelon candy would be really good then - so only if it's this though now we'll continue to try others and see if there are other additions that are worthy bit this one highly recommended well that's it for this particular episode of totally not knives well thank

peppermint Cheers [Music]", "dNZfj05JpLs": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection where candy store in a soda fountain in a toy store in Tallahassee Florida thanks for coming by today we're going to make some hard candy and we call it image candy because each piece will contain an image in the middle of each one and the artwork we're going to do today is going to match the flavor we're going to do an image of a cross-section of a watermelon into the sugar we've poured that's about 310 degrees Fahrenheit we're adding food coloring and we're going to stir rapidly and it's going to boil out all the excess water and the food coloring to keep the candy from getting sticky today we're using three colors for our candy black pink and green [Music] our candy cooling table has done its job and dropped the temperature of the candy tremendously but the edges are cool to the point we can handle them but the center's are still blistering hot and liquid we gotta cut the candy apart into its colors that we're going to use and then fold it back and forth to even the temperature out so we can work with [Music] candy without food coloring is an amber not a white and we need a white for this pattern so we put it on our candy making hook and Juran pulls it again again folding and millions of air bubbles each one of these air bubbles reflect light and when she pulls enough of the man that several million in fact she will have a candy that is a nice white that we can use [Music] for this design we also pull the red to make it pink we wrap the cool rod that we made out of the black candy with warm pink pulled candy and this is going to become the seeds but we need more than one seat in a watermelon and we're going to do that by duplicating it I've always loved watermelon I used to grow them in Brooklyn when I was a kid yes farming in Brooklyn at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens they had a children's garden there and one of the fascinating things I learned about watermelon as they started as a bitter almost inedible fruit in ancient Egypt but they started cultivating them because they could store water in them for months during the dry season and break them open and crush them for water they really do live up to their names and then they bred them to be tasty and of course this candy is the tasty version of the water problem [Music] you know you can try this candy for yourself we sell it over at www.pdfsupply.com to scale it down we do that gently so we don't distort the image and we pull the log into rods and eventually we roll the logs to cool down we stop at any point the candy will go flatten the design will be destroyed so we keep it moving almost all the time [Music] [Music] if you enjoyed this video there are lots of others on our candy-making channel here at lofty pursuits if you want to see new ones we come out with them every week or two and you can subscribe to us we'd appreciate that we also are on Facebook and Twitter and we're at WWE Network an buy this candy and try it for yourself and see how good it tastes the candy is more than just a pretty looker if you're interested also follow our feeds and you'll find out what we're doing next week we're going out to visit a couple of other old candy stores and soda fountains and we're going to be blogging about them online thank you for watching [Music]", "Lnzrq_P9vzs": "good real sticky today yeah roughly out like a sunrise in da I don't know I was checking checking earlier like 40 we've been under 45 percent all day so huh pretty toasty the past couple of days on with me that had something to do with it yeah first couple armed agents number heard you guys were scared yesterday tornado warning yeah actually I got an alert on my phone oh yeah first I thought that it was saying I was gonna be I was approaching like my data limit and I was like just for NATO warning oh I was like I don't know I was like I'm not really gonna take it very seriously just because is weird like in this we're pretty close to the city like winds have a very hard time looking up you know next to the city right and also it's Syracuse yeah and I live the Kansas yeah still you get a message it's like there's tornado heading your way but you know there is not there wasn't an actual tornado there's any potential nobody seemed that the rotation on the radar so that's why they were like oh nobody has seen it touchdown but yeah yeah it was like I was like 15 minutes the winds weren't even like super high it was mostly just raining yeah oh man that rain came down yeah that's crazy but I guess if I started hearing like the walls creaking and stuff okay I'll go downstairs but I didn't hear like any wind really I mean I I was like worried about it like that but I was like glued to the window like I wanted for a phone o clock yeah well it said that it was coming from the east so I was like [Music] we didn't go to the basement but then we went down there and we were like why do we come down the basement yeah well our basement was not as fun hopefully the Simpsons are taking yeah oh yeah I played that and wasn't really that fun we got over it pretty quick because they basically you just move and then you jump and then you attack and those are the only buttons and then like I played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game that Karen I grew up playing did you play - oh yeah no we didn't have you oh you didn't have you oh well basically what the want Athiya at the laundromat oh oh well when I went to Milwaukee it was a hat I played some Simpsons game and then I also played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game and wasn't as fun as I remember yeah I guess when when you're little and you're just used to the NES and you haven't had the Xbox one yet you're like wow this is great look at the graphics look at all eight of the pixels this is 16-bit we said this Looney tune for the NES at daycare like we never had one the blouse and I don't know why but I could think about that game so much recently I'm ready to drop like 50 bucks I wish game it was like a Looney Tunes basketball game we used to love project raisin no I remember it was like the airplane game there's like a 2d airplane game Oh oh man yeah and that was awesome and the plates of like great you could like match them up or something yeah do you remember the one the car won and like you'd be wait you're like driving down the highway I think you were trying to like get away from the police or something and there's like a certain the police would catch up to you or something and then there would be like a semi or a semi you know truck and you drive into the bed change your color and you come back out oh no that's like the only part of that game that I've ever taken oh yeah you don't member what game that was oh okay all right so is that kind of all put together then just to walk okay yeah that's candy right there so three and four three and three-quarters just uh first I never make anything one another we did it once before but dreams are hard and pillows wow look at that that looks so cool on the fruit even gonna be able to do like a green green piece like if it's all just talk well it smells so good yeah it does not really good it's got strawberry what's most on the Jolly Rancher like watermelon Jolly Rancher yes always have a work to do great we need someone videotaping me videotaping you guys [Laughter] here yeah chance possible help it maybe we'll just do a green stripe watch your hand oh maybe we did paint body because it's already things okay so it seems it pink by the green stripe can you still make it green though like with mini make green and pink stay really practicing with best bachelor just really try to scrape it yeah virtually invisible are yes spatula you got it Oh like so my glove that's right so we're gonna do green body pick strength right there dude peace that's what we did before hey I know I know I know I know Green Valley thinks it's a modern elements like remember you don't remember how you did it I know we did it that came out good yeah and I think I have I think I wrote down there I think Friday 3:00 and strike what if I put green in here what's gonna happen with this color we want to turn it well you turn this train probably turning brown brown yeah we don't wanna yeah but we still have to have two colors here yeah we'll just leave this color pull it under them take release I know we'd that'd be so controlling crazy doesn't water long before yeah he did green by who did do it and I got my notes if you add green it's gonna overpower well go ahead look at any old snaps and I will do this you know actually I think I do remember reading that flavor yeah I know we did you do that an extra hand here can I make up the next petal we're gonna go ahead make a petal in our life I'll do something here speaking as Steve I'm envisioning it and we did a green body right bones aren't good with their custom well I want thinking green however we do it okay we'll get ready what if you guys just broke off the little tiny piece and then just put in like one drop of food coloring to see what color it changes it to remember being like we only did it one time mix is destined to watermelon this is a brand-new bottle or no we only have the one all right smells good watermelon ewwww yeah no smell really good and you no matter the color it's gonna taste great listen I can turn shop yeah okay so you want to do pink body green stripe I still want to add like a little drop of red so it's a little bit more vibrant a pink because watermelon is more vibrant pink thing did you pull this it's gonna be pale pink we want to take our piece off yes we do Green yep we'll just agree of course this is the part where I wanted max to do it but uh this is this is the part the learning part that I wanted to match is just how much to add yeah and handling the small you've done that before have you sorry you have you've done have you colored small stripes yeah okay I guess back in the basement hmm can you can have that that big blob see you kept custody in a big blob I'll take a little bit more for my straight would you think that us discussing the stripes and get cheers over on your side more drama yeah he's also develop flavor it is great no keep Gary strawberry know like required yes i'm the cut-open and put it my backseat the darker color is just going yes not here won't know the whole thing deployment yeah well no I was wondering if that yeah is it just food coloring yeah this way Brenda right we flavor the whole batch I was just wondering if it's gonna go to Jersey - mind blowing flavor it like two separate dogs like partner flavor that sense they were that sided yeah you know now that you've said that I'm not saying I'll never do that favor what's your flavors would be complimentary no I mean lemon lime a big one right we're in the future now and you can see that they are packaging up peanut butter fill driven candy well I just wanted to let you guys know that we now have whole yeah shirts available because a lot of people in the last video left relieving comments saying that they wanted those shirts and what I was thinking is in the future if you guys really like a certain saying or really want a certain thing on a t-shirt just leave it in the comment section we got enough people requesting it then I can make it on t spring and I will let you guys know in the next video when it's available so what I'm thinking is would be like a limited time only and then once you guys decide you want another shirt then we'll make that and now just like replace those shirts so if you want the whole yeah shirt check out in the description before it goes away back to the rest of the video you do like yellow and green Dan then you might be on something and if we get sick of making the same old flavors over and over we'll get into the two-tone what else could we do too bad this wasn't a live stream huh we access an American classic and then the next one I am breaking bread trying hot dogs fantastic oh that actually didn't ring yeah because I did it before yeah and dad doesn't remember or believe me so I'm just let him have his way I'm surprised like I don't know cuz it was like so pink and you would think good heavens way when you've been married for 35 years

yours does too well mines getting - remix and quickly cuz it's smaller so it'll get cool off faster he's got more leeway because he's got bigger blob so pretty soon she's gonna start mixing it up pretty well because what but also what he's throwing it on the vocal it mix it a little bit but he does want to be sure not to get on his gloves that's the color on is on most puffs because tired to

people just forget to consider that there well I don't think that like videos necessarily have to do that but basically from the YouTube channel goodness has increased in walk you don't want to know when you get to yes I mean you don't want to squish it up and stuff because then you'll never I'll mess up the stripe so just try to keep it at this one size as if it keeps squishing that yeah I was thinking about that but I'm like well I can't have it be three feet long either how do you keep it and just keep with the same size you just can't really formula moving a lot on me the extra hot now

peanut butter yeah holy cow and that is some good stuff yeah really good yeah I think it would be good to have the mango again and just like another another shot a flavour about you really good yeah

just at home like Nathan's playing or something Joe and Kerry are getting dinner ready and then Natalie's just like hey no one's paying attention to me she's smart enough to know that all right 16 points look those pretty colors Wow there's a gorgeous place your people into summer that's about a pound right something like that so 25% to monster I don't know I never do the hard candy really I'm just winging it they play a 8.4 8.4 so if I - all right [Music] yeah cuz I don't want it to be wider than the paper so it looks well it's nice it doesn't look sloppy because I've just gonna run out of staples soon yeah too good to be true it smell really good 16 hey there you go you get out of here yep all right well let's get out of here [Music]", "OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "EjbVn3G-Syo": "what was that the alarm system oh yeah that's the alarm is that going to be picked up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so that's always nice it doesn't have that dirty hemp [ __ ] dirt taste nobody wants that [ __ ] all right so if you're curious man first off i didn't tell you all to stay tuned for the promo code so stay tuned for the promo code y'all are about to get that let's talk about the price point of this guy real quick so the other gummies they're 25 bucks this one's 30. i can actually get behind that price point i did say you do feel a little bit more off the other gummies quicker and i was saying that this one's a little deeper but man you do feel a little bit better off of this one than the gummies five dollars more makes sense i'm cool with that doesn't hurt my feelings now so let's get let's hit you with that promo code let's keep the promo code simple this time we're just gonna hit you with delta eight that's gonna be the promo code it's not going to be the [ __ ] numeric roman [ __ ] delta with the triangle and [ __ ] [ __ ] illuminati [ __ ] okay it's just going to be delta all right man so that's that's going to be it for this video i'd like these gummies they're pretty good so yeah man y'all have a good one we'll we'll see y'all next time peace so quick update video on those gummies uh because it didn't really start hitting me until after i went home those things are bad ass man uh yeah there's he was not joking when he said three will knock you in the couch because i only took two and i would say maybe about 30 minutes hour after i left after we shot the video is when it really kicked in uh yeah they're strong delta a no there's no need for the cbd in it man the delta a if you're wanting something recreational and uh not illegal this this shit's good this shit's good so definitely try it out man all right y'all have a good one hey man be sure to check out our two videos down at the bottom and uh if you like our [ __ ] and [ __ ] support us man uh like comment share subscribe do all that [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] bell you all have a good one born to cbd.com", "0DR3s3E1VwM": "first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the

awesome he knows you can do a strawberry but don't do a raspberry I can't wait to taste this I wonder if it's okay if everybody before lunch I gotta call my mom I want you to trust him right now no I said I call my mom okay I guess I guess that going now hmm how close did you come I guess AR purple or I mean this one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right

watermelons crush your old box something good yeah and I know life will be changed you know really dank but not by the part like where you choke on it yeah you're gonna have to meditate over that damn I don't know what that's all you have to try anymore just gonna have to make pieces you can become okay Terry okay panting adjourn it is meeting adjourned is [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much

and one person to record it one more tap otherwise it doesn't happen oh it turns out too many oh no all right it goes nothing oh what is it really it's not nothing flavored right yeah there's no label oh wow yeah nothing smells like flavor i'm doing green apple for the first time so i'm going based on the recommendation that is very green wow very green that looks like ecto cooler the high c oh yeah can you see it on the camera yeah it's very green very green how green is it oh so green berry it's too much green oh yeah that smells like green apple oh yep all right well we kind of had a little we need to put a ton of coffee and coffee oh yeah wow that is really reacting look we should have seen the coffee let's go crazy this looks like very halloween-ish is it all too smoky yes i am getting spooked well your mom should come in here scared she'll make you feel better okay so you can protect me from the boogie man yeah are you saying that because it's green and sort of boogies no my mom just always like uh whenever we were talking about some being scared or something she always said just boogie man it was just like the uh kids she's like yeah just don't worry uh don't get eaten by the boogie man don't get taken by the boogie man don't get attacked by the boogeyman you know don't get sued by the boogeyman yeah exactly stuff like that it's just her go-to now it's mine because you know i was raised by her yeah i guess you can use it she'll watch it no that's pretty lucky yeah those are what is i'm gonna stick the boogie nobody's blown away yet but you guys aren't you're not shooting it down right away which is good i'm just letting everybody taste it first oh okay it tastes like wood it tastes like like it tastes like light green yeah it doesn't taste super green no it's very faintly green yeah i think it needs more two more plus if you imagine for sure it's like eating a little bit yeah we could probably get another at least two more shots yeah oh they really the fun shops so the green apple's gonna go in the same bag as apple pie flavor right yep very happily oh yeah people who eat this will live happily ever after keep the doctor away for sure i mean that's true for candy too apple flavored things [Music] all right you ready to hand out spoons sir oh you know it corn man don't your wife get jealous all right this is going to be the one right correct knew it i knew it you sure did those of you tasting green apple at home be sure you wash your candy before you eat it it's a free-range flavor you don't know where it's been man this is gonna be a fun one to scrape out of the kettle yeah it seems like it's pretty sticking pretty hard oh yeah what was that the first one was pumpkin right yep uh there was like a quarter inch layer in the whole kind of just got you guys just have to throw out the kettle yeah yeah we went down to the 100 year old kettle store got another one it's getting there you might as well put the rest of it in cool oh man that's really struck my tooth mine too because it's still warm yeah that keeps happening to me too that was for me biting it with my teeth i don't know if you can see yeah there's the string yeah that's still fun so stuck to my tooth that's why i don't find it i just like kind of i feel like a lollipop that's when i get the wood flavor so i tried to just like get a little nibble up and wrong with that that's natural yeah you vegans are into that it's natural like grandma used to make at one time [Music] you better do another half shot whatever yeah it's like 10 my third third feels like i tried raspberry and it wasn't but i mean it's still give it a little bit of tartness if it puts them in i think that would be good a couple of tablespoons or something and we'll taste it afterwards yeah and cool that so we'll make it like kind of like the orange is that six and there's an 18 pound batch now it's like two three four tablespoons so yeah i think i think six teaspoons in that one you want to be like that you want to be more like a lime which is a little tarter yeah let's go for tartar okay because we already have the apple pie which this tastes nothing like which is good they're very different but yeah let's go for tartar okay tartar sauce that we're probably not really the best uh hard candy flavor yeah i don't think so i mean it sounds weird but it could be fantastic just like chocolate conversation if that sounds weird that's great yeah oh boy this one might be more like a 15-pound batch i'm not scraping it yeah really good luck throwing it yeah oh my god maurice is not sticking to the cuddle yeah we got that going for us or anything else making a lollipop right now max you're so strong yeah that's what they tell me have you found so some of the other flavors have also stuck to the kettle well it's from the taste test you know it just gets colder and colder because when we added the 10 shots to the coffee because it's the coffee isn't it yep yeah that one took a while to doing that yeah all right i'll go get steve after this i'm scraping it like with the the back end of the scraper i need to specially modify a scraper that can stand up to this yes flexible but still rigid all right you can barely even tell there's any candy in there yeah good job [Music] oh yeah see it bouncing yeah two five only four fighter oh what are we doing what are we doing uh wait for the color yeah full green's fine full grain perfect yeah it's already colored just be hard to unless you're gonna do like light green and dark i was like maybe like pull a scrape out or something yeah oh yeah yeah this table's worked out pretty good i know there's a lot of nostalgia behind the the old marble one this one offers a lot less headaches i think that's all we're getting shards of candies you got the rusty thing with a scraper oh it might go flying everywhere that's not too good charging dust that's about it yeah it's cooling down pretty good fill a little bit before you want the hook just a little minute all the candy out of there looks like a brand new old kettle that's exactly what it is did you grace the hook yeah all right wait that hook oh no i did the one on the counter oh it'll be fine so no no not this time too early i guess it's still a little green huh oh thanks for the real laugh yeah it was real totally yeah that was a real fun x well we saved half of it that's cool is your foot okay you just put it on my foot's fine yeah you're looking at your shoe well it's all good dude we got six flavors so it fell off that happens to fall off the hook don't do that don't worry it's gonna come out of carrots paycheck yeah for real sarah bad news i don't know if you're going to be eating this week well she could eat the spare candy yeah yeah yeah let's take it out of the garbage come on it's like a thousand calories right there's dinner it all tastes good that's honestly still like a pretty decent amount of candy yeah that's like most of it yeah i mean we're only doing 18 pound batches yeah and we're going to mix it in though yeah this is a custom badge all right i i gotta get the next match going too though yeah all right yeah at least got to get the water in there and turn that on you want me to put a tripod on and do the thing down there or if you want to if you think that'd be good for the video but um if you're more comfortable doing that i got this this is this is still pretty pretty yeah i mean i think it'd be interesting to see someone do both i don't think i've ever seen that before okay yeah all right why not it's still wicked soft though i don't know i might even get back on the hook for that yeah dad you seem you seem pretty upset with your mustache i can tell yeah that's a nice about the little dude i don't go throw that on the floor again italian christmas donkey something about the walking through the alps of italy or something yeah yeah i think that this probably just cooled off the rest of the way while i was switching gloves oh let's yeah though that's a nice color though yeah yeah there's plenty plenty of color in that uh food coloring i mean if you told me that was 18 pounds i believe whatever it is yeah yeah really yeah it's a little more easy to manage now isn't it yeah way easier well it's like a lot colder now too you think i just went on the hook a little too early uh that could be part of it um i'm not saying this to be nice though like really like the past few times i've had to like try to pull it out differently to get it to like go uniform because i've been getting like real lumpy bits and then like you know the thin spots on the hook and like it really wants to fall off and the lumber parts on its way to the ground that looks like an apple right yeah every week every week every batch that only a beer will solve well it's almost five me too oops my bad i'm almost wondering too because like they remember i was saying on the pumpkin how it almost felt like a bike tire like it felt like inflated i wonder if there is like a different water content in these uh flavors you know that's why it's bubbling up when we put them in there yeah definitely seem to have marble reactions i was trying to see if it's water-based or glycol or what but i don't think there's even ingredients on the bottom it's something soft yeah were you thinking the same thing you're just looking at it does it feel like yeah yeah i like has the candy felt like this all day i think so oh yeah a little softer huh yeah i mean you had 10 shots to it like [Applause] snake green apple do you remember the green snake that was at the zoo and it was always coiled up on the tree branch there was that one in the big yellow one i remember one time i was at the zoo and i was talking a snake and then my my husband was really like pressed up against the glass and then the glass just disappeared boy the snake came out and started chasing him and then and then my uh aunt and uncle they made me go back to my bedroom under the stairs and i was grounded for a week man that sounds like magic or something i don't know man i just unexplained got yourself in a pretty hairy situation huh you know i never i never put that together but what's the only other dudley you've ever heard of no one definitely do right right like do right you've never heard of the new ray i don't even know i just know i've heard that oh maybe he's from the old cartoons or something does he do right yeah hannah barbera remember the episode of the office where ryan starts telling the story about uh the lion king and saying that heaven is like my cousin mufasa how does kevin ruin it what's he say is that like sticking into there a lot more too yep oh wow you seem like good flavor warm candies sticky uh you want to finish this one this one up yeah a little bit for the camera and stuff oh come on you got your cap shoes on and everything those are my orthopedic shoes oh well they're very stylish what were those do you remember those shoes they were supposed to like make your butt round you don't remember those they're like really round yeah they're like this big too where are they sketchers oh they look like i forgot about them remember dad remember when you guys got his moon shoes for christmas do you just like stuff your feet and they're just giant rubber bands i wonder if it made you jump any higher because like it also kind of weighed you down yeah although it did it did make everything springier but that makes you heavier it was like there wasn't enough resistance yeah in the vans where like you would just kind of sink all the time yeah just made you think more yeah yeah helmets yeah yeah really what were the sock'em poppers is that what the ones that went on your hands were called just like the blow off things yeah they're great [Music] i'm trying very gently with those i'm sure a lot of fights got started and finished with those plus but nobody i knew ever had two pairs so it was always like okay you get the left one just a perfect amount well that's a sad little batch any difference i don't think so oh no there's flex in there it's like totally evaporated so we're just gonna smell [Music] yeah you could definitely see beans in there but i don't know if there's enough in this one shot here oh i just made enough of the beans it it smells pretty strong so i want to taste it before we you know especially since it's extract not flavoring it does smell really good all right um you guess what i mean it kind of smells like it's going back to just like plain candy smell now yeah go right there i mean a lot of the aroma does evaporate that's true that's kind of chicken now are you going to put some of the powder in first you should i just want to see where we're at yeah i mean it's probably nothing but if i just i just wanna i just wanna make sure okay where are we going pizza man that's delivery as soon as your pizzas are baked can you deliver them to karen please yeah i'll bring them out in a minute that'd eight uh but that's that's in a full batch and this is essentially a half match of that so hopefully we'll be able to get away a little more um what do you want to do with this i mean a tablespoon or a teaspoon i don't think a tablespoon we could try and see what happens um this is just like crushed vanilla beans yeah there's special kind though i can't remember my favorite one of those items was eighty dollars thirty dollars yeah vanilla is expensive it's so it was so good vanilla bean it was a while ago so i can't really remember but it was crazy expensive for the size of the bottle yeah i'm thinking a little powdered one was 30 bucks see how this comes out of here maybe i won't do it over there just in case yeah [Music] really smell good and then again it smells a little better i think i think it kind of smells like that the high lull or whatever you're supposed to say that i'm not gonna like it reminds me like a candlestick all right i mean again at the end of that it kind of all went away but you guys want to taste this anyway very nice put in a couple of shots of vanilla you know why you're gonna eat it this is the other stuff it does yeah it smells good i just didn't it just didn't taste much okay two two [Music] can always get you another one if you need it oh [Music] [Applause] that's all i got get down for this one too uh sure use as much feedback as we can yeah take it around i can run [Music] okay i'm getting good at reading the faces after these this kind of tastes like candy sweet don't no taste like much no vanilla there now another tough one it's tough to get it strong enough i tell you what what i already told you keep on two shots of vanilla so that's ten of these two of the other ones let's go for an even fifteen [Music] see what i don't know what you're even talking about we don't make mistakes here no nobody does oh no maybe [Laughter] [Music] 82 degrees you better hurry oh man that's pretty warm in here yeah no i it's like pushing it through corn syrup again i'm gonna make fun scraping it out again oh you know it i'm almost thinking about turning the kettle back on that's the funnest part right i like it but you know what i've been hugging all the fun i'll let joe do it this time i'll watch both of your heads safety first man see how cold that is that's doing better than the last batch yeah just kind of crazy because it was in there for a long time gotta get my finger strength up is it hurting your arms haven't to you know resist all the force that i'm putting on a cutter looking nicer very nice yeah probably feels like my wrist is gonna break [Music] oh yeah there's no candy in there at all thank goodness for sinks huh yeah because i mean it's probably pretty cold coming out of the kettle and i got to do all this stuff yeah yeah all right let's go take a look it's the last kettle though at least so what are we doing stripes all white i'm pretty sure just pulling the whole thing calling it you got voices are supposed to be the color there you go no problem okay joe good work joseph try some soup we're all counting on you we're all counting on you to try that soup potato thing yeah it's cool a mashed potato soup no it's smashing no there's not mashed potatoes is there something it is okay potatoes like sausage or something like that and and kale all cooked and maybe spinach i'm not sure there's other stuff in there about i don't know what it it's good though yeah yeah i haven't tried it yet max's mind always makes us a bunch of food yeah the e-best vegan she sure is nice okay yeah i just want to say good work dad thanks we're all counting on you i know can you just hammer this it's hammer time oh thanks oh yeah you can see the flex in there the vanilla so see how it makes it smoother it's the canvas that's the secret canvas gloves probably helped too yeah it's only touching canvas it makes it shiny showing it up look at that you're doing good dad oh boy let me just turn the fan on there goes sounds like an airplane taken off okay all clear your clearance clearance i'll do roger oh that's one of the tribeca there's one more clearance you ever been to a turkish prison i said that one time someone who didn't get the joke that i've never seen an airplane they were like what yeah oh yeah who doesn't go there right you haven't seen the travel mags that turkish prisons are all the rage all the influencers on instagram are here you got pictures with the prisoners yeah i can go back i go sit down on the real you know i heard there's a growler in the fridge so yeah it's not gonna drink itself you know no no well you didn't spring for the new fancy self-driving drivers so [Music] hmm [Music] good it's pretty soft man a little it's kind of cold too long so well that's what we were saying maybe it's from putting all the flavoring in i mean this you want to guess how many shots are in this one six uh nope nope nope really more more oh won't be using this again that costs too much oh yeah this is this is like this is it it's like at least 100 pounds this is like around equivalent to like what 15 shots or so 15 shots yeah yeah plus the crushed uh specialty beam whatever that is uh one of the easiest flavors and it was a one a very strong one well even when i first started like that's when we still have the two fold i think of us and you can put like two or three shots in it yep yeah i mean all the shots if you look for the queen book they all used to be like like two shots at the most you know and now it's like at least three shots how'd it feel to be pulling out a batch again like riding a boy you guys want to see how long we can not talk to it won't last yeah i know no jake oh yeah do you really have to say it every time kevin it's really good it's like one of the best needs like as he's unwrapping it the whole office starts to look at him like yo put it down kevin don't feel like there's sales people too and they're like no no phone calls what are you looking at checking the time it's time for you to work max still two o'clock you got time to look for the clock when you you got too much time if you got time to look you've got time to work yeah work cody i'm not paying you to look at the clock you know some places at work that's a legitimate statement i'm not kidding you're a dalton i might want to keep the camera back yeah hurry up dad what am i paying you for um beer i i don't know what are you paying me for wait you're paying me uh no oh that's a first i meant you're paying me yeah what are you paying me for european european european if you're american when you go in the bathroom like just one of them these are really sticky yeah i noticed that they've been really sticking to the uh the metal cutterizer yeah yeah the metal smacky thing we even know all the technical terms of hercules yeah you lost me with all the technicalities uh sorry so we got so many different flavors that i figured we'd just do like a round table of each one so you guys want to start blue raspberry so this is the blue one blue raspberry i just got the slow motion video of this i didn't get actual videos appreciate the color good job max it does look very cotton candy it's kind of like the like we did the cream video with this that's this is actually gonna be the um the cotton candy replacement for now tastes just like a dum-dum mm-hmm it's not nice it's just like a smart smart that's really good though i really i feel like that flavor is nailed yeah well bananas now they got it all right so while we're doing vibrant flavors we'll do cranberry next so this is what the cranberry one looks like hey craig fyi we've done cranberry before so you don't have to do this one if you don't want to no uh we haven't done it whatever well like taste for sure okay yeah i dropped it so we're not doing this no we're doing [Music] that's really good it's pink it tastes more sweet than because i feel like usually cranberry juice is like kind of tart let's just taste sweet oh you guys eat it without me yeah no i can't eat it it's news you lose should we add citric acid do you think to the cranberry yeah oh craig said the juice tends to be tart depends what you want i think it tastes good yeah that's pretty good that's very cranberry this is like the biggest pizza arcane i've ever heard in my mouth so far so far [Music] no cigar green apple coming up you've been asking for this one for a while huh yeah yeah you know we finally got to it ready ready oh no are we doing that oh it's a tiny bit sour like i wouldn't describe it sour but oh yeah i got a little i got a little tart there it's not exactly a warhead but yeah just taste way more green apple than when we tasted it on the stick i think we got it reminds you a little of sour straws there's no sausage they could even be more sour how many citric acids did you use three three three three three three six three teaspoons or three tablespoons yep that's pretty good though i like that one nailed it didn't know it at the time so this one you can kind of see like a little flecks of vanilla i don't know if you can really see it on camera but in person and if you were to order it it's kind of hard to see yeah where would it be really close let me see this is going to be part of the um what do they call it oh it's going to be festive a taste of fallout name okay taste the fruit flavors fall unfriendly um the vanilla will be in there um we probably won't make this again because unless we do it separately it took about nine hundred dollars for the flavor it's seriously the most flavor we've ever finished there's something max and i wouldn't want to try a long time remember we tried the cherry vanilla once yeah and the vanilla wasn't very vanilla this this it didn't know when we tasted it on the stick it wasn't very vanilla-y do you have it in your mouth yeah like this it is now there are 15 out of here so now it is so i think that's gonna be awesome i really like this one are you more of a chocolate person craig no i think it's just like it's tough to get the flavor because like you saw like it tasted really weak now it tastes really strong are you a vanilla guy in general i think so usually yeah i'm still getting hard candy it tastes a little to me it tastes a little strong for vanilla i'm tasting the vanilla now but i think it's just right i like it is it good yeah it's good maybe if we did all extract instead of the extract and the flavoring like you know how we did the maple with the canadian maple and the regular maple and it kind of you know we kind of lost a little bit of the maple-ness and we did that with in a cream mm-hmm okay then we never had a maple pear candy hmm that would have been a good flavor well the reason we did is because it's so hard to get things mapley enough and to me it tastes more mapley because of the walnuts that we sprinkle on top yeah that brings out the maple otherwise it's not very maple you know you could put a whole bottle in there and it still wouldn't be very meat fully i believe this is coffee um cover up your face this one's coffee there we go pumpkin pumpkin coffee's got the street that's coffee the hat's like in real life does everybody here like coffee no poor crack that's coming through pretty good for someone who doesn't really like coffee though i kind of like this for me it's not like super overpowering or like it's not very bitter maybe that's why because there's a lot of sugar i don't remember caffeine yeah coffee with sugar kind of reminds me of the peanut butter molasses it kind of reminds me of like mocha flavored ice cream yeah i could drop one of these in your coffee well that's yeah right yeah coffee flavored coffee that would never work double coffee all right so the last one is pumpkin pumpkin saved the best food pumpkin pie pumpkin spice yes this is this is the best one and this is the that's the biggest piece of hard candy i'm ever going to have yeah it's a big that's a hawker mine's got diamonds huh why don't you special i can tell you're apparently is that what i always sounded like to you you could just see your legs [Music] and then you did the dance that's really good and this one even has a little texture to it because what you had we added actual pumpkin spice so you can get some little little granules of uh rice yeah i kind of like it i do do you grab something really good everybody's gonna like these this is good these are all good this is the best one really good that's a good slogan dad everyone's gonna like these it's good but this is the best horny stuff you should put that on a shirt you should put it on the building um what does that say yeah i like the pumpkin i mean i like them all but i'm glad we stopped for the pumpkin we did flavor i would eat pie crust pie i totally would i love pie crust wonder bread hard candy oh boy gravy okay i've been saying gravy like not ironically for a long time if we could fill ribbon candy with gravy what about gravy cream it'd be so good gravy cream yeah wrapped in turkey okay interesting i'd have a short shelf life yeah two hours really we can do mashed potato instead and it's then it's vegan if we use the vegetable shortly greg did honey baked ham and a bunch of thanksgiving yeah right i think he did cornbread he deserves stuffing wow the ham tasted just like him can't go wrong with pecan pie i'm pretty sure i saw um maybe brock's the company makes a candy corn i think they were doing some thanksgiving flavored stuff so they must have got the idea from greg yeah from lofty pursuits if you're wondering who we're talking about that is a lot of person soups it is ham flavored candy actually that one is pretty good just yeah the ham i like the stuffing one didn't really do it for me yeah but the ham i mean it could be sweet salty savory that all works i wonder if he's doing it again this year no probably i don't know i don't think he likes to repeat himself too much we love to review that all the time that's all we do yeah basically because people keep asking for it so we can make the people happy or not make the people happy it does seem to be a good business model to make the people happy maybe you should write that down you can sell it on a t-shirt i'll do that right now yeah all right good work guys okay hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe [Music] paper", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

tight eye candy is and you can kind of tell where this batch ends right here is just like very like almost orange heavy and over here I think the Blues are really coming out never here like the green and purples really I think this is the most beautiful batch so far they go I think so yeah yeah something about the crayons over there so anyway that's the secret you know who use crayons no refunds oh yeah and I work on the water okay next dan yeah yes it didn't sound exactly like a question well I said we're working on the hard water melon heart can you next row I think you thought ice is just a statement oh yeah I realize that I said it watermelons next yeah two of them and then lemonade oh yeah this attorney a bit more when you patent they're gonna try to get that yeah wouldn't pieces yeah sometimes the corn syrup must be getting a little bit warm so that's a little stickier than usual so usually I don't have anything let's go you do anything other than prevent linking your though that's all pulley at home from cracking and flaking but I get that cold gonna crack some flakes just wait you learn this thing recipe so that's what I do yeah I want change the recipe and he's gotta wait for the other one to come off your burger that one on yep it's only a one kettle text oh yeah that's it show the last truly no but you're right the King has watching yes it is and now it's not now it's tough it's going down good what the heck you can do that thermometer you can do it yeah did you tell me that if I cheered for my kite it would stay up well it worked still up there yeah we're listen everyone got some windows do that makes totally well thing well the thing is they mix too well they want to stay together hmm it was on the inside regs or death row stored and then it just got stuck to the window it was there for a couple years yeah we got to own it good it wasn't a window emergency wasn't a window nobody looked out to well really stands the glass really Jolly Ranchers watermelon dollar interest like human butter one thing apples smells great I don't know max thanks man yeah this is my like raspberries MIPS smells like purple pink okay oh I put some stuff away yeah I didn't thought was the old colors yes every here know what I used to say when a little too huh over here now okay tear you out all right group eyes on the Bloods yeah eyes up here yeah and like that huh what's she talking about we are closer this one it is nuts in insulin that won't translate maybe just me but you see much you're getting more better at that I feel like a bit more gooder at it pretty soon he's gonna be the goodest one dad you better watch out it's except for that I almost burned your dad like pretty much every time I do this snow did you hear the chip the genuinity it is boy yeah oh yes this one happier they get heavier as the day goes down I don't even have to run do you think that like when this first gets into the shots are like oh yeah what's gonna happen all right see if we do a way we're doing the green strife and then we put a little bit of red in the body anyway right green stripe and then we do we put a little bit of red in the body even though it's pink right yeah first timer to light up but on my own flip back with the colors yeah it's like you remember the first time you drove after you got your license yeah really yeah hello I think I went to the Ross's house I went to school I didn't get I didn't even take my license test until after I hear it was like that was pretty gung-ho huh to get my license and then I was working with that that's way too big of a strike what happens it was too big it was right we have two weeks trips also just like too much collar like I should I probably should only made it like this big that's right either [Music] the key for anybody making cart canes at home when you mix the colors and don't push it all the way down to the bottom and you also want to make sure that you get all the old little pockets on top too because if you have like a little pocket or color on top you flip it over you need color on your table and likewise when you push it all the way to the bottom yeah like this one this is gonna be messy the one who said you made this type too big you should you have like put it more to the side yeah I should have done like this much or something and said all that I'll do it over on this side next time too because that's kind of the cold side first time in a while yeah so can you chop off some of this over here and put it over there I could but it's such a if this is like this thinnest part too so good deal yeah we've had really big stripes there's something that they're just not I'm smaller farts weird stuff hahaha blueberry banana yeah I think it's just a little cooler down here either side we get the air above it it's no sir does that have anything to do with like the the water comes in I'm missing we think maybe it does because it definitely it comes in from this side you know zigzags all the way down and then there's a pipe in the middle that transfers it to the other side and then the side so I mean I guess really should heat up from this side over that way not like from one maybe anymore do an event then it's just nice that you guys even have more control over the temperature that's what I was thinking about I didn't want to like I was like I want to keep bringing up the table but yeah I mean the fact that we can just heat it up and love if we were on the marble table this might be a rock right now yeah like it's pretty cool yeah and the temperature would have more to do with what number batch it was rather than yeah yeah you guys don't really know nearly as when he's sticking issues is used to just understanding the temperature of the table butter I don't know cuz when it gets too hot that's why it starts sticking yeah so it's so easy yeah that was a very porous I mean remember in there on really know what this that's the weird part is like the height of the marble table got the secure it was you know if the hook gets hot that could stick keep the table as hat that's when the candy sticks is Atiya but we get this up to a hundred point yeah so must be maybe the novel table got hotter oh you know I remember to hit dinner well that was like right after we were done with the candy you know you put the temperature gun on it you were like 165 whoo but it's like right after the candy yeah yeah it seems like this thing's really good at getting hot and then like dispersing all the marble I cannot get the green to stop coming off of this thing hmm I'll think I have it tryna cool down yeah nice cold muddle check the other seven pillow for your candy that was like the first thing somebody else said it no you do that to Robert oh this one since he did last night Oh which one yes if you want to go bad you've been throwing all morning so it feels bad yes dear I'm getting kind of old and frail can you go camping anymore yeah hey max 28 now so yeah not the only olden trail on here okay my one of my daughters called last night told my wife your mom said if you forgot I'm going really I'm going camping with her oh yeah no I didn't say I don't know where she can walk with that so if you're watching wait what about mom going camping there why don't you volunteer yeah that's it yeah yeah you wouldn't want to go camping yeah I mean you know what camping means cut up vegan hot dogs and home fries and relish ketchup and up above and don't forget the pokies for you get Smokies in your teeth [Music] and that's a whole sports he's like you just put the spores in between I kind of want to try one it doesn't sound like much how did you ever knock it's obviously no there's like a little kid thought well that's the genius of all of it is it like he's like 17 years old he sounds like he's five yeah but in the best way we love you Lani I think he's even older than that we don't seem like he's in his 20s yes all right yeah honey pepper bottom not a name I hear one of the great talking about this little Club nature well it was interlocks nature was it's not nature but it's me true because he's neat today how neat is that bready need are you guys really need to cool this down on its I mean the green is it's kind of cold right yeah this is really hard over here if you do this you'll you just stick to a man you'll make it well cuz you've been doing it longer so you're better at it yeah yeah that's why is that a bubble or is it just like Oh analyze papa you know there's no popping sound Oh get a good one grab your last one yeah I had to stir with your nose doing my go pans go dead and where did you get that hookans it bare hands Oh that's just like look they're like dripping out of the mountain like well I feel like if they just always had hands it'd be like normal like raccoon it's like it's not it's not weird that wreck yeah and but it'd be so weird about it hands like tigers or something I was gonna be even crazier if like animals that right now have folks I'm imagining birds with hands now do you know how advanced we are compared to other animals how much do you think has to do with hands because like sure if a dog has an idea you can't really do much with paws he's Griffith so then I caused him to pause wolf mm-hm you know we watched a lot of like the space stuff and all that and like they say when they're looking like when SETI is looking for like you know extraterrestrial basic messages or something that I need the more complex language is more intelligent the people who invented it were and they say that like killer whales have a language it's like way more complex than than English huh so I'm like man what if what if they just had hands and conquer the waters the SeaWorld yeah it's pretty neat they say dolphins are super smart right but then look at like like orangutans and gorillas and chimps they can all learn like sign language they all in hands yeah and they're not building any supercomputers from there they're rainforests that we know of users really gonna hide again it just looks like a tree because idiot humans are coming again we got to hide everything put some leaves on it they'll never know no because the orangutans still want the secret of answereth but ah shoot that's it man's red flower something power jungle book dude you're giving me that look like I don't know you're talking oh yeah your mama's just saying she couldn't watch Disney movies when you guys are groaning oh why no because she just falls right to sleep oh no she can watch any movies gonna have to call right sleep please if we watch any movies it was usually with our dad cuz you didn't fall asleep never ever he never loved you know I've never seen him sleep oh yeah you're walking my elbows get crackin I wonder if I'm getting old food just just you're a real guys back here two old guys and one young guy you didn't yeah yeah I know it where's the $5 than that well if you don't have five bucks I don't think you're that young anyway mousses come on Steve respect you probably has everything those last matches really really sticky like carnage it I know yeah I feel like you used the word interchangeably with the smell but yeah it was a stink I think of like it smells strongly like I had my face over and I'm like I smell water that stinks so good yeah yeah barbecue stews but it stinks great let's restart listen when your side we think so yeah three strips and one side whatever you want to have checks out sir whatever I want I want a motorcycle and a pony the party tree is not Christmas he said whatever I want crack Gilda in December I want Saturdays and Sundays off hey you got that it worked this year dreams fall and you never let down well usually never let down I want to work and work and work oh then you'll never be let down yes yeah whatever what else are you doing or that's nice yeah the perfect size to have wow race off but you just store this yeah like really is that people on YouTube can like go back to the old video check out that yeah secret what's the last pose oh yeah they worked great yeah those horse beds are you looking for your brush pens sandpaper its head it's done it's like why are they so wrong so I know at least Tigers their tongues are barbed so they can lick flesh off of bones I don't know if I don't know if that's the same reason that's like house cats you find that always like really the cats cows the kids said oh I know why and eat their young two layers dark when they're there sit at the bottom of the staircase and like somebody knocks into the butler and drops like a whole vanity and the lady's like oh the tea must be ready let's go yeah supposed to be green zag really dark really just lies flat now you guys need to get your tracks it is technically green but it's really darker so we need to straight to bed and I put too much color it all right as it dries it gets lighter in color and then it just turned brown yeah it's all really sweet your eyes kind of tilt your head and imagine it being green it's basically yeah everybody watching this is water this is green but you know the camera adds ten shades yeah it's true it's so cool just like watching but you think so [Music] you can see it melted before your eyes before what do you think school are watching this mountain or I can paint dry oh that's right why this day that's good jazz is a very dark green right already [Music] I've said it before and I'll say it again it doesn't sound like helpful advice but really if you really tell yourself just go faster you will go fast you loser now Larry that's not a tease ding attorneys mm-hmm worth every watch I do it anyway brunch head of literacy what that was like in theaters continuously laughing captain Michael or famous it's about art or something captain Michaels art supplies it's about George Michael Batgirl [Applause] [Music] five while somebody's not goats the scary part kind of look like - yeah well that's all right we don't really need to keep the table right it's not be still like 105 to be perfect for lemonade okay so I guess we should probably do that this time don't tell me what I'm asking don't ask me to tell you what to do Oh what film a know-it-all yes a kid said no continent and he looks at the little kid and said let the boss I gotta tell ya I don't know what this says about me I watched all the tears I didn't think cliff was that bad now whatever norm is always there to be like yeah shut up sorry Frank let's watch although we probably only have three subscribers in play I've never met a cleft okay I feel like I've asked you this out you guys never watch read between the Lions right they have a segment I wonder if that's one of the ones because like Teletubby said come on Americans they're in like middle school that's up 50 knots right here you know it's not aware that there are like gradients ticket you know I feel like it's older you got the older a kid convenes that we call the kid yeah like I was just talking to Eric about that last night we're like man cuz he's talking about be 21 or whatever and I'm like you might think like to you this is the most advanced forever Ben yeah one of you one dude you're a baby you're a baby that's on them you know once I'm 35 I look back myself 428 be like man I was a kid yeah who's my mom and daddys kids once you become an adult you realize that nobody really it's not like you get to a certain point and boom you're grown up yeah you're just kids struggling to pretend like you're an adult once you become an adult you realize that adults don't really know what's going on and they're just trying to get through life but you should so listen to him if you're a kid yes they know more than you people listen to their parents most parents are just trying to save you from making the same mistakes that they made yeah but I find that with me and pretty much everyone else they learn a lot better from your own mistakes like you can tell someone not to do something but then they're really not gonna know until they experience I think I feel you have to experience the emotions of like loss and grief and like even it's like matter that I've rail that something and like you lost the game like Tom you can something I don't know I guess there's two different levels of understanding to we're yeah we have the knowledge of that where you did like truly understand thank you the boat yeah you have the practical knowledge it's like either knowledge or knowing it versus like experience yeah yeah I guess it's kind of like the candy to like I knew exactly the debt so I hid it like the people on YouTube who wants to be like they understand a lot of like what you guys are doing but unless they were to actually do it yeah it's a lot yeah yeah like so I think we were talking about when this all ends and Dylan isn't coming here yeah and he didn't record me doing this I think the data would show people how like yeah I've seen this downtown and then you see how hard it actually is because you guys have done this for so long now you guys actually make everything look so easy well that's it always brings me back to when your dad was showing me candy canes he's like yeah all you got to do is kind of move your hands like this and I'm like well your hands aren't moving I'm watching your hands now look at the simians yes remember my motto is kitchens where the hard way it's good nice and shiny at the end here he's gonna breathe is a little green barely getting greedy down Tammi like phagocytes prior such a change if we're at 250 already around 2:30 and the two-threes are like the time right really gets hung up or a bottle feel okay yeah yeah well squeeze it up almost done I'm not dumb yeah yeah right dad come on okay so maybe I've done fine one beer out of your paycheck oh no back good idea the last one look at that there it is around one you get a round one that's the last piece so this is the first time in the history of Hercules candies that we've ever made watermelon hard candy to sell separately I even more watermelon colored colored shirt today not happen yeah they left off the seeds but yeah you folks loved the watermelon so much did we just had to make it in a hard candy we made candy canes this year for the local folks we don't want that so yeah yeah it's coming soon to a near you yeah candy in the wintertime watermelon huh mm-hmm yes isn't the first time that we've ever done just a watermelon yes it's definitely cool I don't remember we did watermelon candy canes this good yeah remember you're the one that told me no I remember telling you about it oh okay no we did it okay and they sold out very well because I hope yeah making me make a flavor there would be likes even maybe oh no when we used to have open house I would ask the kids like no what's your favorite flavor of candy cane that I'll say water going like almost unanimously I said why okay well I guess I better call my mom kids want watermelon candy King there's something I learned a long time ago listen to your customers Wow I think you asking for something do it if you can [Applause] selling really fast I think by the time this video goes up because well maybe next week yeah this batch will be sold out we'll have to have made another one cuz I didn't even put on the front page of the right place and then I'm like kandi page bug golly gee Gompers it's going trash oh I guess people did wanna and some people just get like if we have all these single flavors they just get one bag of each cuz they're gonna we have cotton candy lemonade watermelon butterscotch no those things are often all mixed together and the fruit and friendly but apparently they their favorite flavors so well cotton candy we never got the fruit and friendly that ones always separate opens yesterday we did the tropical fruit punch this high tide yeah that's a really beautiful it's almost like we're getting now we're almost like we know what we're doing so we don't really so this created of you your most recently created a big rush cutting our orders you know how when you're driving down say James Street there's all those traffic lights mm-hmm do you ever hear them all green oh do you yeah it's a it's like wow it's still your Nirvana so today I'm no bottlenecks and then across the bottleneck I slowed down people and you can help me you can help me not have you can help me have all green lights read the shipping stuff at the top of the shopping cart page and if you're in a warm area and a lot of you are now because summer is coming pay attention to the cold pack and the expedited shipping information because it's really important because if I come if I'm print and print and printing and I'm handing off to Karen and Sam and they're getting them ready and then I crust come across Florida taxes Arizona oh they didn't know our Kolpak gotta set him aside figure it out so if you would like me to be able to speed down James Street and hit all the green lights in my mind it would so help me if you would read the shipping guidelines at the top of the page I know it's like 10 to 12 sentences and I'm sorry but hey you're home what and you know what it would help you go to sleep read it cuz you know it's probably boring so go ahead read it go to sleep and then wake up and order your cold packs in expedited shipping if you're in a hot place but if you're in Alaska we're still doing okay without having to have cold packs in Alaska because Alaska is a cold pack mmm in some cases Oh buddy believe they have mosquitoes the size of helicopters I've heard of that yeah they can be small children and animals mm-hmm yeah bummer yeah where's Craig mosquito got him mmm again malaria I guess you wanna see me staple up a couple of these my technique okay so I guess Oh mom I know that's like an older hoodie but you it's got that new hoodie look to it okay you snag you snag a new one when corporate wasn't looking it's pilots for advertising I don't know how long I'm not really ordering any new merch right now because I don't know what they kind of me is gonna do so I don't wanna get thousands of dollars for the stuff in that's not gonna sell so I'm just kind of selling when I have seeing how things go with the economy in people's lives and so we're just kind of in a holding pattern and I think a lot of companies are in a holding pattern anyway so yeah we're just waiting to see what happens so I'm not ordering a new merch right now so yeah if you want something of this nature get it now well it's off yeah or you could get the we do have some things on teespring to the people get and I'm pretty sure teespring still going so and they're just printing it as they get order right yeah it's good for people in like Europe Australia places like that because they don't have to pay crazy shipping prices right so because shipping from here to foreign country is not inexpensive mm-hmm can you tell me what you do with my watermelon labels put on the home under this or over here why did you do that I was just using the last night oh you made that yeah in print shop yeah yeah I remember it like greeting cards hmm before they fill them with I can't say the irises with a V no I don't think you want to say that word right yeah so computer irises SHM irises okay so here's the technique Wow I know tada take a picture of that panel oh that was some an angel singing in case you know mm-hmm take Crick that's all I have to say about that all right I always get back to work thank you you know all right all right right now I'm assembled the a team for a taste test can you guess the biggest all right a small yeah the best part of the taste is when you put it in your mouth you talk mother man I'll tell your mom tastes like summer oh it's seamless yeah the new seedless watermelon flavor yeah GD flavor mm-hmm you always were a bad seed thank you very good yeah must be those two months true to the flavor good mm-my stupidest thing to say to yourself it's really good you can't take my line that's a stone darkness good yeah it kind of ruins it yeah so taste like watermelon now I'm ready to fight yeah make something long-lasting as soon as I put it on my tongue was like slightly like you know faded away and then like that to Venus where the shirt comes over all right [Music]", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "Le6Ox7avobQ": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm gonna show you so I have these three that I got from Canada's mom that's grape flavored hundreds milligrams of THC this is the green apple same thing 100 grand 100 milligrams of THC and then this one is blue raspberry and 100 milligrams of THC so I'm gonna be doing a review today I'm gonna pick one and then I'll review that flavor and whatever and then so on I'll pick another day and I'll do you know grape and then the green apple so today I've decided to go with the the blue raspberry you get all of these a flavor at Canada's mo and I had a feeling that because it's summer and because it's hot I think all the cubes have stuck together so there's the top piece there's this yeah yeah doesn't have a smell but that's how they look so you get four cubes so I'm just gonna put it all in my mouth that's all because I can't even like it would be too hard to even try to break so if you're going to eat these individually they're 25 milligrams of THC per cube let's try I'm not really tasting the blue raspberry yet I'm tasting THC mm-hmm I could teach something but I don't know if it's the blue raspberry just like a little bit of a sweetness but um it's trying to cover the THC but it's not doing a very good job the THC I just coming out I just read in the back here they're from can occur concentrate so that's maybe that's who makes them and Canada does know sells them or I don't know I know that you get these at Ken abysmal they're slowly starting to break off the cubes but yeah I'm not uh not really I'm not really tasting the roster I taste something a little bit sweet but then like the THC is very overpowering I guess you could say so next five o'clock right now I'll come back when these kick in let you know what they're like once it's like usually they're pretty good I've never had a problem never ever had a problem with anything from Canada smell okay so I'm gonna let these dissolve come back when this is kicked in here it is again the medic medicated hard candies Canada's no I'll be back my kicks in okay so I'm back and this is kicked in [Music] what happened was okay so it started to kick in maybe a little bit after 6:00 and I thought well maybe like it's just like this is gonna be it type of thing so what happened was I rolled a joint and smoked it and if you want to see that part you'll have to see watch the video before this one because ed and I are but with making videos like on at the same time so that wasn't a very smart decision for me to smoke the joint but it's it's done stop it I can do now just like sit and wait it out so this is very good stuff I don't really feel like doing anything though like yeah I don't know we just don't feel like doing anything I'm very thirsty and there's no need to smoke a joint just maybe wait the extra five minutes cuz that's what I should have that's what I would have that's what I should have done is wait um maybe the extra five minutes and then I would have been like oh you know what I'm not gonna smoke this drink is here it comes but no there's another don't do what Donna does I'm just drinking coffee because it tastes good right now like it always tastes good but right now it tastes really good and um yeah go ahead go to cannabis mom and get those the hard candies all the packages over there darn it I should have grabbed it maybe I still will keep we'll hang on grab it and go back over there and show the I put my coffee down I don't think that's in the same place but okay this medicated hard candies getting my cannabis no they're good they're very good if you're just starting out then just try the one cube I don't I don't know don't do like more than one but one kit would be good um any any any um like any pains or anything I that I don't feel anything right now it feels good feels good and then at the same time like you don't feel like do anything either so you're not really enjoying it but you are in another way [Music] like I can talk about a lot of things but it probably has nothing to do like I fit you know what today was like the type of day that that like it's like and sort of like in the middle of August and [Music] it wasn't like too hot nor was it like to hold it was just like it was just right and I was just like I don't know like it reminded me of like when I was a kid and stuff that like those days those summer days like that like they were you know you'd be riding your bike or doing whatever like it was just uh it was just like a good day I can't remember those type of days and it was a good day and then at the same time I think like sometimes you get a couple like hot days in August and but then after that cuz like September's coming right and sometimes in September you get really really nice warm days which are okay but um the days like how today was like you know Falls coming and I love fall like I think it's like the best the best season out of all of them I just really love fall so that's what today and I don't know why I'm telling you this but yeah that's what that's what today was like it was like a perfect like temperature-wise day like at the same time like it when you're doing this it's very like real axing and stuff mm-hmm I'm not really hungry at all like it I'm not saying that I won't get hungry but uh hungry at all like so it doesn't really give you the munchies not not Radia way like it's um it's just about seven o'clock so yeah I'd say like the Munchie partly good I don't I don't feel hungry so my eyes feel very heavy though and yours you need a drink always cuz it really dries you out and what else I don't know I like the I like the edibles and then I like joints bonds are okay but like I think edibles are beta bowls and the joints so just are my thing I like to do that stuff because well the edibles like you just eat it and it it's a longer high so whatever reason that you're taking it for you you'll be good for a couple hours which why not and the joints well I just find those easier to inhale yeah I like to just smoke a joint it's okay and to do a bong thing like you're a bong toke I don't know what just I can't get it all in so like that's why they like I like the joints but like if I have to I can do the bong toes it just takes a little bit more or longer to the whole process type thing [Music] know what to say I can't know what to talk about I just don't know what to tell you guys like should I say this and I can probably know it's open I feel really good though this is this is a nice side this is a nice feeling I'm [Music] like I'm not paranoid like if somebody knocked on the door then I would be like oh [ __ ] even though there's nothing even to smell I would just be paranoid because how am I going to say to somebody like how am I even gonna talk to somebody because like my eyes you could just [ __ ] tell but you know you just know like I couldn't say oh no I have somebody's I don't want you I and I'd be like oh no like [ __ ] you can't even I can't even say that so yes if somebody was knocking at the door I I would get a little bit worried about that but otherwise it'll is like I wasn't that or whatever like I'm I'm okay I I just feel really good and relaxed and um it's just stuff that like if it makes you feel that relaxed that you kind of wish that you were sitting on a dock and just looking out there onto the water like you were just looking that's what or if you're like sitting on a dog and it was like either you know you were watching the Sun Rise or you know if you're watching inside today it's that kind of relaxing relaxed feeling and it goes well with coffee this this is what you feel and it feels like it feels like that except I'm not sitting on the dock watching the Sun set or rise up so but anyways that's what it makes you you feel like well sons like Hannah over there but it's not setting yet this I'll already be done this before it even said so those annoys I don't know if you can hear them you know those buzzing noises I think it's crickets or something or some type of insect you know that highlight noise that you hear but I remember I was a kid I don't know if you can hear her anyways as a kid because um like Killarney is not that big of a place so there's like lots of bush and stuff and and there's like little trails and stuff like that so like if you're out playing with your friends and then you guys decided to go on this trail and or go whatever into the long grass or whatever like stuff like that ain't always you'd get further out there and you can hear those buzzing those I don't know what insect that is and often sit like a cricket or oh I don't know what it is but so anyways when I hear that stuff that reminds you know I was a kid it's funny how like I don't know if it's like a 40 thing or it's gotta be maybe like 40 high and in your 40s or something and like when you think of like certain uh sound not yeah like sounds are like just certain things and you think like way but like when you were a kid and it seems like it was a long freaking time ago like it's not like you know when you know when you're 20 and you go yeah when I was a kid well when you that wasn't you know you're still kind of our kid at 20 but if 40s yeah it makes things seem a long time ago when maybe because if it is a long time ago or maybe because you just feel like that cuz like 40 years though that's that's pretty long I'm going to have to go make another coffee soon because I'm just about done this one and I need to like this bad has to be he liked me because I took everything off and washed it and [ __ ] I just don't feel like doing it no but it has to be done just like it just seems like it's gonna be a like a Wyatt like a couple minute job ooh yeah I was gonna turn into like this you know Ted minitor probably like 10 to 15 minutes to make this bad like that's I should have made it before or like while I was eating the edibles I should have made it then because they would have been done in a couple minutes now the only thing I have done is like I put the pillowcases on the on the pillows like the sheets and stuff are here but like the what is it like the mattress protector thing like I wash side and that's dried and everything else but hmm after you'll get that on the line on the clothesline so I was like go down and get that come back put that on and then put the sheets on and like and you gotta put like the blanket and comforter part so I'm really not looking forward to that but you know why I think um I I think I just need some more coffee and they need to just go sit down and you just think a little um I think that's it like I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna enjoy it that's time I was you know worries about anything unless somebody knows so let's that's my review on it skid here's the package and get it at can abismo that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420

gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one

it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "rvn0xep-EsY": "hey guys Shayna here so today I'm a bit of a different video I'm going to teach you how to make homemade hard candy I'm gonna making watermelon flavored umm I've tried this recipe or a similar recipe once before and I accidentally burnt it so I'm hoping this is going to turn out a bit better I got a candy thermometer for Christmas I love candy so I'm gonna try to make some and I'll show you how to do it for your ingredients you will need two cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup you'll need one teaspoon or just one small container of candy oil I am using watermelon flavor you can use whatever you'd like and if you'd like I'm going to put a touch of red food coloring in it you're also going to need a saucepan a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and a candy thermometer so we're going to start off by mixing in the water the sugar and the corn syrup you are going to put it on a medium heat in the saucepan once the sugar is completely stirred in and dissolve into the water then you're just going to let it sit no stirring and boil until it hits between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit also make sure that you can zoom over to does not touch the bottom of the pan it has to be taking the temperature of the candy not the pan the mixture is just starting to boil but about 100 degrees to go make sure that you don't have it on too high of a temperature because you don't want to burn the sugar one thing with candy making is that you have to be quite patient it takes a while to boil if you have a gas stove that is better it's best to have constant heat on it it works on your ways but it does take a bit longer be patient we're now getting quite close to 300 degrees if your guys can do oil to make it flavored when you put it in be sure to keep your head away from the pan because it will send up some steam and it is a very very strong okay you have to be quite quick when you stir it together and make sure you take it off heat first that smells delicious drops are red that looks so good once everything is all mixed in you're going to have to pour it very carefully onto here you want it to be fairly thin you can also use lollipop molds if you have them I'm just going to make hard candy that we can snap later let's hope this works crazy color okay we are just going to let this sit now make sure it sits at room temperature you don't want put it in your fridge and afterwards we are going to break it apart and taste it looks like it looks so good and smells delicious well cuz stringy it is I don't know if you can see that what's quite hot still I've got such a nice flavor can't wait till that's hard one quick tip while this is cooling make sure your candy thermometer you clean it off completely so there's no like little chunks left because otherwise next time you make candy there's chunks you're going to get stuck and the candy will get stuck to the chunks it just it won't work properly so make sure you clean this very well hot water works good okay so the candy is hard now so you're going to peel it off and just break it to pieces and make sure you put it in a continuous a good seal on it comes off so nicely there you have it this is a very simple recipe maybe a bit finicky and it takes a while but how to make just an old-fashioned kind of standard hard candy uh I will leave the link down below where I found this recipe if you'd like to try to make it and yeah I will see you guys sometime soon thanks for watching watermelon I love candy you can replace sleep with exercise so his suggestion was sleep for six hours instead of eight and use those two hours to go for a run or bike ride get some exercise", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you

that they paint purple [Music] tongue that we got last year oh yeah you still have oh yeah keep that thing forever it looks we like to talk yeah it does everywhere we took a snapchat picture and I think I told people to oh you know what I think it was on a live stream and I think I told people to screenshot it and then they like posted it on Instagram and stuff and so input let's have you filter on you or something I think someone put like a puppy filter on you or something like that it's funny cuz like with the tongue sticking out I didn't even have to have the taunting out it already wellness like floating around the internet somewhere man ever take you seriously again yeah never got a job anywhere else why did why was not aired well we saw a picture of you and there's nobody else on this earth as a puffy filter picture that puppy picture you loser I bet you they only hire people I think the puppy feels like the only one that's still picking and snapchat all the other ones coming down [Music] yeah seems like a tab it's like a little under 240 yes there's a little time to kill for three o'clock I'm on three we go a start load before before the batch starts mean I'm sure people won't complain I'll give people some time to file until don't miss anything Hey that's all right now [Music] you [Music]", "ka3YlQ4t5Ds": "i have a question for y'all so somebody said in a comment on an order when she was ordering the watermelon hard candy she said when she was a little kid she used to get a transparent watermelon hard candy they called it candy glass my question is is anybody interested in us making like a whole batch of transparent candy because all we have to do is really not pull it on the hook yeah or is it just one person that wants clear watermelon it looks like everyone's just saying yes be careful what you wish for because you just might get it transparent watermelon hard candy the movie double double trouble trouble doing bubble there you go trouble trouble doyle rules did he come up with that thought i mean he was yeah i just said rhyming we're coming back your way oh well you know what we oh there's still some green there that's all right okay just do the stripe on that side again yeah man your hair must have gotten hot i'll guess i'm in the camera i'll get inside your camera i am your camera yeah i'm back from down yeah i can definitely feel the heat coming off while i'm holding the camera camera's heating up that much huh what the heck man i'm trying to work here sorry i got these extra long elbows here what kind of elbow exercises you've been doing oh i mean you really want me to show off or elbow press elbow curls elbow ups elbow downs curls some knees in there too these knuckles no no i'm not that strong elbow day today really focusing in on the muscle groups very clear-looking terry approved the one very small string so one very small string we could probably just make it like even just but that'll be super cold yeah i'll do it he's a brave man that's a small one maybe let's go a little bit more just a tiny bit there we go i've still got some color to add to that we did the extra color on the butterscotch over here what do you guys thought yellow and green green is it too green when we adjusted the green it would come out like brown oh that makes sense because it's starting off pink yeah oh interesting so the yellow just kind of brightened it up a little bit i'm glad that wasn't your camera lens i'm glad it's caro payne for it oh boy she's paying for the camera mistakes too oh yeah man she's got some deep pockets any mistakes that happen at 720 west mainland kara's hair is covering it it's a good thing she won the lottery yeah that's a lot of green right there not for carol wait any mistakes that happened where craig 720 was manliest oh is that okay yeah that's the address like west demon in my head and i was like do you say he-man or human what you ever talking to people you i can't hear anything what he-man yeah where'd you get the r from i i don't know if people are just they look at it and they're like that's not [Applause] oh it's so much easier with my right hand yeah do you ever do stuff with like your left hand and like see if you can pull it off i used to try to take notes on my left hand um i would yeah they're very smooth yeah and i never saw any improvement oh that was when i was in college it wasn't when i was like a little kid i feel i probably wouldn't improvement if i was a little kid but i tried to play basketball you know like shoot lefty and stuff yeah that you can do better yeah yeah i feel like with sports like because i remember i would uh throw left in lacrosse yeah and i'd be fine but then for whatever reason when it came time to game game time i was like i can't do it i can't do it for real but in practice i'll be fine and then uh yeah just like i think i just didn't have the confidence to yeah yeah that's what it sounds like to you know tell your truth like sometimes when i'm throwing the candy on the hook i'm thinking maybe i could drop it with my left hand oh instead yeah instead of dropping the mic i don't know you might drop it wrong yeah you know i mean maybe maybe you practice that on the fruit by the foot okay yeah try it for next week yeah yeah like he takes them home yeah yep yep so can you sign my slip no no um and because you were saying before the last match you guys just pulled it too soon it's it's that soft that's pretty soft patch maybe we should throw some sunglasses on it or something yeah so it looks cooler i thought maybe bringing it down here we'll pull it off a little bit but what about over there maybe wow i paid for those sound effects did you did you do that in one video what like we would like touch something and it was like drum sounds or something oh uh i think dylan did something like that one time yeah i think it's probably getting a little warm there turn the fan on yeah oh that'd be smart wow we're coming up with so many good ideas today um you guys got an ice cube if you had an ice cube you could hold it on this side of the fan and it would suck the cold through the pan basically air conditioning just the cold just the cold yeah okay if you have water on your ice cube they're a little on your bench you're not supposed to season them until after you're right i used to put the salt on first it took forever to freeze what's your mom's uh ice cube recipe her ice cube recipe yeah i can't tell you that you just i just let i just say that i can't make ice cubes anymore it was the recipe dream might think alike great mom's great right here there's good all right look it's a heart huh anybody going to say spoons live every time i'm like look it's a heart he goes no it's a butt all right not really any need to knead this but sometimes it like makes it a little bit more oh it sounds like you need solid uh yeah if i don't i have to ball it all up inside because i'm a softie i'm just going to agree with you i don't want you to get volatile with me uh did you see that mercurial is in retrograde you wanted to walk away did you but i can't yeah i got him cornered you know i think this is still a little too warm yeah yeah but whatever i'm gonna play yeah it does look really right now that's good yep great so do you think it's because are you used to pulling it off the table that early when you're putting it on the hook yeah while the hook pulls it off yeah you're beating the air into it and stuff i just don't think that it's ever gonna be as rigid without before make an extra green yes so you guys want to explain why we're just doing the one strike because i think the first thing we've ever done is one little strike jerry said yeah well yeah because we got told too yeah that was our theory and then she came into the same theory yeah uh so when you don't throw the stripes or you know when you don't throw the candy it's translucent so you can see right to the other side so if you have too much green on the outside kind of see it on this side that it's like darker over here than it is over here yeah so if you have too much green it turns the whole thing dark we want that nice light translucent tank so you can't have that in translucent well i guess you can't really have a translucent color yeah yeah because there's so much dye that goes into it yeah i guess yeah maybe we could try that though it's uh less green instead of yeah because we always had to do like the green with the yellow to brighten it up like when you throw the pink but since we're not throwing the pink maybe we can just put a little bit of green on so so this is what we're looking like so far it's still like relatively see-through because this is what we had before and this is when we had a lot of green stripes as you guys saw it was the the batch we made before was actually the slo-mo one you saw in the beginning um but yeah this is how not see-through is just because of how much green there was so i already i think it's looking better although the beginning of the first match looks really good it looks good yeah this is this looks good like the body looks good uh joey's just saying he made it right you guys know your greens right yes yeah kale spinach green was my minor in college oh was it yeah green was my major in high school [Music] what's that there's that meme going around it's like a guy pulls a cop pulls a guy over it's like so whose car is this what do you do for a living where are you going he says mine i've seen the meme before when uh just it's like too flat now it's just it has no body it has no body without the air in it oh yeah but have you seen the beam where the the person's buying a car and then they ask the car dealers okay all right you have any more questions before you go like oh yeah what about cargo space he's like no cargo road yeah you know go to space arnold goes chuck you're fired you are now fired as a customer you are javen i think i like that one better than promoted because yeah oh i meant like the customer got fired the batch seems to be going fast are you guys just like ripping through it because uh yeah and it's the softer ones just pull out faster like you kind of have to keep up with how fast it gets pulled out that's what it's starting to say and then you lose a train of thought while you're trying to shoot a video because you're focusing on something to watch is that one and then i'm not even shooting videos at all you're there to finish the sentences for me you know how when you get really close to somebody you can finish each other's sandwiches sandwiches yeah that's exactly what i was gonna say what's charlie say when he's trying to avoid the cheese when he's on the fancy date which chase is too much i can just see him there like sweating looking at the cheese splatter that's one of my favorite episodes so all of ours i feel like all of our celebrity crush is on that pretty much yeah yeah so alexander zadario if you're watching feel free to come by we'll show you how to make oh she's in that one that's what i'm talking about oh i was talking about charlie day oh right yeah yeah or where'd they need to be [Music] if real we'll share i don't want to get too fixated on that show somebody said charlie the other day and like this this certain tone and all i could see in my head was frank with the mannequin come on charlie i took it out last time i did it this is yeah i think this batch is definitely looking a lot better huh this batch is definitely looking a lot better i think the one small green stripe that was a good idea good idea kids how uh how is it looking now that like the green stripe is no longer on the outside of the candy it's now on the inside yeah yeah it's still okay yeah i mean i think it looks good yeah because there's only the ones yeah sometimes it's on top sometimes it looks like it's kind of underneath i guess like on the other side yeah this definitely looks a lot better it's like backwards watermelon watermelon butter water whatever i feel like there's there's certain things you're not supposed to talk about like politics religion and pronunciation that's that's the three things right you know i've never heard it but that should definitely be added to the list i'm sorry what was the third one uh pronunciation oh you pronounced it music pronunciation i say pronunciation one of us is wrong tomato tomato i've never like it's so weird that's like a vocalism oh yeah like in australia i think it just hits a motto well here like it was like an old school like new york thing tomorrow you know but like i've literally never heard anybody say tomato so like here's a super common expression that you know describes this word that nobody even says like that australians australians be like am i a joke to you oh come on what's tomatter yeah we're literally just talking about earlier australians probably my favorite accent [Music] kid that like was on the news for like having a party so big that oh i destroyed his town yeah can you take your sunglasses off no i don't think i will no i'm i like them the end of a badge they grow up so fast yeah i guess it makes sense it's like a lot warmer right yeah i guess yeah the stripe was the cold part but usually the the end of it is like rock hard so how'd you get down before me again every time every time even now that you're doing four five six yeah i don't want to wow look at that it's me mister hard candy piece finder i think that one right there yeah that one kind of looks like a jolly rancher yeah it might taste different the color's in my finger okay yeah is that blasphemous to say that yeah you're gonna have to bleep that out huh i got a stripe me too i think joe's probably gonna shrink yeah i know what that meant yeah that's watermelon right away there's a lottery and melody how do you get those seeds though one by one i know exactly what you're talking about though it's like way smoother right there's like no striations that's weird yeah i think it would be that present you know yeah it's a lot like a jolly rancher it's kind of each other yeah is that blasphemous to say that though like i said earlier is that legal hope not we didn't mean anything please forgive us we're very poor", "3mA2FaNRZ2A": "welcome to 420 rx cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi today I'm making THC infused watermelon lollipops using 1/2 cup of water 1/3 cup of corn syrup 1 full cup of sugar 1/2 teaspoon of lecithin and I'm going to bring that to a boil I'm going to use pink food coloring as well as white for my color I'll carefully place my candy thermometer and continue on a slow boil to 300 degrees once I reach 300 degrees I'll need to move quickly I'll remove from heat add my flavoring add my tincture and mix that well I'll transfer it into my plastic candy funnel and proceeded to fill my silicone mold as the candy cools it is going to start to harden it will set quickly in the molds now I being impatient went ahead and put my molds in the freezer for about 5 minutes once they were sturdy enough to move I'm bringing them out removing them from the molds they turned out perfect fifteen watermelon lollipops made with an alcohol-based tincture enjoy be sure to subscribe to this channel for updates and notifications

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "BhOM39nn0Wk": "dude this is me by the flames were a candy company this is the same people that made the toast eight minutes this could be super happy [Music] you're like my resident candy guy thank you I like candy I know you do that's why you're here yeah so today we're going to be trying some ghost pepper heart candies I know absolutely nothing about them at all okay that could be incredibly underwhelming they could be incredibly spicy who are the really go means go ahead go you know look like I I think it's the same candy oh dude this is me by the flamethrower candy company this is the same people that made the toe of Satan made this this could be super hot Shh yeah let's give you really hot I don't know God used I swear you trick me to get into this seat myself into this boy it's actually a very good extract two more on that later oh so this is me both playing freakin a company that's a field event Oh Satan which is incredibly incredibly crabby spicy um sea greens ingredients are quiet by the way we have two flavors is blue raspberry and wild cherry they're both ghost pepper I don't know like the red might be hotter because it's red I don't know um okay sugar corn syrup water artificial flavors citric acid ghost pepper blue number one in sodium benzoate so it's just a ghost pepper this goes it's the exact same ingredients on both of those they should be equally hot which one do you want to try first you want the raspberry it's oddly shaped to like I'm like picking up with the leg I feel like it just it was like one piece both bags feel like that oh that's adorable and they're all stuck together smells like  one off oh you can see like the peppers yeah yeah look it look it I see oh there we go you hold up the light I can see he right through it I feel like a man like a Jurassic butt yeah okay judging by the inside of this I don't think it's gonna be that hot it's stuck to your lip oh yeah you ready you're doing it this candy a little heat all right I'm just sucking on mine me too but do you get a little low heat action there's something very slightly I don't trust my mouth anymore though your mouth is probably broken Mike really is do you have taste buds still I mean I do I say the whole time my mouth is very leveled up my stomach holy schnikeys was it good there's like a juice or some of them really you bit it uh-huh it just like came out the side of it argues yeah like huh gelatin gelatinous going in it was just some weird chunk hanging it's got some spice um I feel like Emma could handle this mm-hmm I feel like rod you could handle this we should warn people uh-oh warning choking hazard yeah um not a heat hazard choking hazard so the more that I'm like I'm Michael by the way so I'm gonna I'm gonna get into the wallet area I don't buy this let's see if it's gonna be any different great hotter why those these are holy either truck the other that was scary dude I got to bite into it kept absorbing into my teeth and not breaking and then I try to release this duck I will say okay the wild cherry one are made better so like you can actually see like the pepper you know a shape of a pepper mm you know I'm working on this - this one has got like I'm not seeing it I mean the pepper is red generally speaking so you might not be able to see it as much in here all right do these are good good flavor mmm good flavor and I'm actually trying to think what this compares to like candy wash so behind on like eating candies we do this is like it's a jolly rancher there you go it's a jolly rancher it's a spicy joy hmm it's exactly what it is it's okay so talking about the heat is it an enjoyable money heat is not enough is it too much no it's not it's not to my level like I'm completely cool like I'm not on fire but it's like you do sense the heat mm-hmm what's enjoyable I agree um I mean for you on my scale it's like a 1 right n about point 5 out of 10 or anything like that I give it oh there's absolutely detectable heat mmm and I like it like most candies when you're to see like a spicy can hear something like that one you're probably talking about cinnamon and - you're talking about this like super artificial flavor but he comes from right this is not that no like I believe there's actually goes pepper in this and I truly believe that what I represent the heat that I'm getting from this although it's mild it's a it's a quality that makes me I always forget this do you like those pepper other idea that's the one yeah the point the one super hot I like scrappy flavors a little bit too but ghosts numbers like the one super hot that I actually do enjoy the flavor okay um so that's why this works well yeah that's good so um super into these um I mean I don't need a lot of candy but this would be I wouldn't say that this is like a challenge like this is definitely like appropriate for like the look it up like Emma your daughter could have it right and could probably have the easily but yeah this look good want to eat you're like 10 of them what um maybe a little overkill there I'm starting to get a little sweat I don't know you got sweat building up oh yeah I'm like your nose and there's Samson your cheeks right there who's that accumulative yeah is it definitely definitely working where do you get a rack me next video tune in for Alex getting erect in the next video

show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "PZGm-I6L4HY": "[Music] hi everyone so I've done the lasagna video what you guys have already watched and I've decided to take to try these so the medicated hard candies strawberry-kiwi there are 30 milligrams per cube there's the cubes down there from can abysmal I'm not gonna be taking all four that's way too much THC for me I already have been doing long chokes and that was for my lasagna video if you want to see what was on yes oh that's made go back and watch that one okay so let's see how there there's two left for a rainy day okay so I'm waiting to taste the strawberry or the Kiwi an idea I taste THC tastes weed I don't know why I never taste the the flavoring I just taste the THC always the weed so I'll let these dissolve okay so it's eight thirty eight thirty six right now I'll time it again I will come back when I kicks in in between the next time I come on I'll have different clothes on that's just because I'm taking a shower um yeah I don't taste strawberry Kiwi I just don't but never a problem with cannabis Mo's any of anything of their stuff anything it's all been good so suck on these take a shower come back when this kicks in let you guys know how long it takes to kick in when I'm feeling and everything else okay so it's 953 right now and I took it at 836 so a little over an hour I started feeling this like a couple minutes ago it's it's good there's nothing wrong with it they could take a shower and whatever and that was but you're more like I'm not sleepy and I'm not hungry it's more like relaxed like it's just like such a it's such a good feeling like it's just and I even worried about anything like if you have stuff that you're worried about you wouldn't be worrying about right now cuz it just it's not there to worry about I feel happy but I feel happy cuz I'm relaxed um and I feel that really am i I don't know I'll come closer can you see now if you can see anything my eyes they feel really heavy and like like if a cop came up to me right now he would know by just like putting that yeah yeah the flashlight in my eyes um my hair is driving me like really bad because I don't like I don't like it down but it's still a little damp and that's a whole other story that nobody needs to hear about um okay so it was the medicated candies from Ken abysmal the cubes the taste it said was strawberry Kiwi but it tasted like weed to me like THC like you right the whole time okay so eating cuz I did eat today and I do and drink right it wasn't like the other time yesterday when I did that review when I had nothing in me so even with like had supper and all that stuff so it took a little bit over an hour to kick in I took two cubes so it's 60 milligrams you feel relaxed feel good no anxiety or paranoia you feel it like really heavy in the eyes so that's why I said if a cop stopped me he would know right away that like if he's Sean Sean if he but Dad the flashlight like in my eye whatever eyes he would know just by looking at the eyes no munchies or anything like this is like what I would like to do right now is like if somebody were to tell me like some stories just like if somebody I would just like to listen cuz that's what I feel like doing that's how that's how relax do you feel I was gonna oh I was going to do um the bong toe but that I thought well I should maybe just roll a joint but then like it's this start to kick in so now and the more I'm talking for whatever stupid reason it's kicking in more like it's you know I still feel relaxed though but now I'm still thinking I should roll the joint because why not I think that's what I'll do any of you girls out there that are watching this this would be like a good time to really like like pamper yourself like either do it at home and you know get some really good body cream and whatever or like have somebody drive you to the beauty salon place and get them to you know do your feet and your nails and everything else it would probably feel really good I would imagine so I don't have the patience for that so I'll just use the body cream that's that's good enough but and the guys I think um I think you guys should probably either get your spouse to give you a really good back rub or get your feet massaged if you don't have a spouse or your spouse's no they're not doing it because maybe they just don't want to then go to like one of those massage places and get somebody over there to give you a back massage or a foot massage and it would feel good I'm not doing stages but it's like way too long my mouth that was getting really dry ik and I should have brought up some some water and I didn't so look well I'm not really in a lot bit right now okay so I'm gonna go and feel relaxed some more and then I roll a joint and then come back and just say whatever tell you tell you guys when I'm feeling or when I'm not feeling or maybe I'm still feeling the same who knows okay I'll be back after I do the joint or whatever whatever I say because I don't remember okay so I finished that joint like 10-15 minutes ago so um there was not a need to smoke smoke it because I just feel great but just feel that much better I got the munchies vibe so let's chip cookies and you can't see it but it's milk and that tastes pretty damn good I would say recommend these cubes from can abysmal the hard candies um maybe not for the like the long time smokers that you may need to take like a couple bags but like the average person and like the thirty just the one would like kind of calm you down a bit just sixty would I took um like I can really feel it that's why I didn't want to take more than 60 cuz I did the hundred whining oh that was like it was some strong [ __ ] so 60 is good you feel it food tastes like really good I also can side my back was a little bit sore earlier I don't feel that the foot that's [ __ ] up I got these like I said it's nerve pain I haven't felt that and I was getting like real bad today you feel like pretty good almost like a shirt brought up another cookie but it's okay ouch um I was gonna say if those kind of pains were stopping you from like saying working out or just going for a blocker um going to the gym or whatever I say that if you took one of these cubes you wouldn't be feeling whatever pain it was that you're having I'm working out wasn't gonna make it any worse either like let's just put it that way I would say to do this because you could probably you know you've been getting out going for a walk or something like did I think this is like the stuff you'd want to do that on it's like an abysmal so anyways but [Music] I still feel relaxed but more like you want to get into like clean bed and hair like new sheets put on or whatever it is or and just get comfortable and you can just think about stuff I don't know what stuff but just think or if you didn't want to think thank Charlie's outside the door then close your eyes and go to sleep because that's what the next thing is is closing closing my eyes and going to sleep I think I I don't know what I love it like they look a little red here or something I don't really like looking at my eyes cuz are just oh my god you probably hear something that's just Justin oh yeah look a little bit like a little puffy there I'm not puffy but like well maybe yeah like here they look not puffy but like hi I guess you could say that you could tell it's all in the eyes okay so how do the match hey it's good get it it's like an abysmal it's the medicated hard candies the 30 milligram ones if you feel really good so and pretty soon I'm going to be going to bed so um I think that's everything I think I covered it all I may get something else to eat though cuz everything just tastes good why shouldn't say everything gets all I had was no good cookies in those tasted really good so um my I feel I can barely [ __ ] open them I don't know do they look do they look good I feel like I feel like Michael Madsen Hey oh jeez okay hang on like Michael Madsen they're all squinty anyways [Music] that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting a lot of oil on me and honestly I since I only paid ten dollars for this I am gonna eat the whole thing and get back to you guys in an hour Bon Appetit and let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "4MD06UCMUd8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and I know I'm really close but there's a reason for it I'm gonna do an edible review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "7KjihoRsDHE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this huckleberry hard candy by Bill ferns hard candy company so they actually reached out to me like two days ago and since I'm Sony with this I'm gonna just basically accommodate most most people who do reach out and ask me if I can review so the way I'm doing this as I had the blue raspberry one last night and that was kind of like on me so I don't like blue raspberry or like I don't like raspberry in general like at all so I don't know why I got blue raspberry but if you like raspberry the flavors really good if you don't don't buy it's not you're not gonna like it it's just got that like the raspberry sourness to it and I just like I said it's a personal it's a choice on the taste the hi itself though it was really like it if I was a new if I was a new smoker and I was just getting started this is a perfect way to like get your intro into edibles because one piece is going to be just enough to give you like the feeling that you're after the feeling that most people like associate with edibles but in a mild enough dose that you're still gonna be full control you're not gonna like pass out fall asleep you're not gonna you're not gonna have like a crazy freak out because you had one piece this is a 10 milligram piece of candy so it's not that big if you're more like if you're more of a daily like you smoke every day after works I think then you can go ahead and have two two or two three and then if you really really want to make sure that you're not gonna wake up at all then you brought out four to five but you know like I said it's everyone's personal choice with that I'm going to go ahead and pop this guy open they don't have this score marks which I don't like because I have to like cut it beforehand otherwise I don't like doing that so there's that when you open it at first Wow so here's my package and it's already open I was cool I don't know how that oh yeah it just wasn't sealed all the way that's awesome so yeah this is a huckleberry candy that's really good oh yeah so yeah I definitely shouldn't I got the blue raspberry if I would have got the huckleberry one I probably would eat both last night this is really really good you don't taste any of the marijuana at all yeah Naruto you get a little bit of the tickle that you get in the back of the throat whenever you have like a candy farm edible but that just comes with any of these really good like really really good oh my god yeah definitely if you go with this one the huckleberry if you're gonna buy them this is hands-down you're not gonna have no complaints yeah anyway man I'm really enjoying it so I got a bunch of stuff to finish I gotta go do a bunch of like cooking and a bunch of other stuff for the rest of the day alright so that was the huckleberry bill affords hard candy and yeah like I said this thing's delicious so if you guys get a chance definitely go pick some up and go", "TGHWwV_CI58": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review of the medicated hard candies I've done reviews on this before I've just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to

fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can go back and you should have all the information if you have any

live please leave a comment please subscribe I will get back to you and as for now have a good day Cheers oh I don't know how to shut it off let's seal it like that", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your holiday orders get him in because miss Deb does get busy I'd love to fulfill your orders I hope you're having an amazing night I love

make a girl aware slap a [ __ ] in the head and I'll go back to the drawing board and bring you another one click one letter one tree right you", "0g1Gn7OQk20": "[Music] okay guys we are doing the flourish gummies in the cub watermelon 100 milligrams of THC already how one of these had to he's kind of funny they're not delicious in my hair supposed to be in a bun but it's not delicious and good like the Caminos I kind of real strong marijuana taste to it really strong they don't taste like delicious but we're gonna seem to get a sign sir we're going to see if it gets as high so I'll be back about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "8lvkErB9zbM": "what up guys dabby here so we got these for free like three weeks ago labor day weekend from uh lbc excuse me the corner lbc i just got back from my run i'm very out of it kind of right now um so they are precision dosing and visually wrapped uh five milligrams per piece so it's pretty weak sauce i don't expect that i'm gonna feel it too much because i probably have a high tolerance as vegan gluten free natural flavors and colors and let's see it also says emerald sky brings together 25 years of candy making experience with the vision of infusing time on our confections with world-class cannabis extract we are dedicated to an uncompromising standard of quality flavor and potency and all of our handcrafted tsc infused confections um one whole piece wait two hours full effect that's i wonder if it's like a hybrid i'm assuming it might be under this part but i guess i should have killed this earlier yeah we're not going to get over this um i see it does contain dairy or maybe it doesn't but it's vegan so you guys do see it's made where peanuts are made okay well i would love to figure this out emerald sky edibles.com let me try to peel this off i'll get back uh it does say ingredients are sugar corn syrup citrus acid natural mango flavor gum herb and also cast extract um it has zero milligrams of sodium zero grams of fat i think four grams of sugar six grams of carbs it does have an algae warming it is made in a facility the process is dairy peanuts true nuts oil good stuff so [Music] wait like it says for two hours and then they're very hard to open so your children will oh my goodness will not be able to get them out so inside is actually two individually packed so it's pretty cool i guess so the other one won't get dirty while i'm waiting let's put a few little bear on it and we'll die and see his heart dropped it's gonna be a lemon truffle mango so let's see let's open one of these bad boys up let's see all right it looks like sugary like super sugary it's like kind of almost the size of like a jujube you know what it's called mega knight it's hard definitely hard candy not much for the waiter i just get over it flavor is really good mango flavor for sure knocked over my water and 12 23 i'll be back in an hour okay so it's been about 18 minutes i've also hit my cz i kind of cheated so that i hit a sour tangy so i am drinking a little restaurant but i do fill in a little bit we'll see in 40. two minutes all right it's been an hour i've hit my susie about three times [Laughter] me hmm blinkered the sadder people this might be sorry angie [Applause] okay i ate candy an hour ago the emerald emerald sky here's the other one a little tropical tropical manga now i'm staying hydrated i'm also drinking a rock star or like i said i hit my cv a few times i've only done in the last hour i've been trying to work out i've done only 50 one legged chair squats it's 25 meters five but excuse me um because you can't paint i have painted one side of sativa edibles and then um i almost faded at a cardi b concert up to the fifa edibles but these aren't stupid so anyway the candy is delicious i will say that um usually five milligrams uh don't usually hit um for a while i was eating slices of like 30 milligram brownies every night and then for while i was doing 50 milligrams tonight um i haven't been eating edibles like that lately i'm just smoking with longer and stuff so and like easy but i know we ate some of the cano nanos canadas the other day nanos and they were really good and those are like fast acting sativa candies five milligrams of cheese and those i don't eat too much because i don't want to paint but uh i'm assuming because i've been exercising a little bit i mean i've been kind of feeling like i'm not indica but kind of like my adv is in full effect right now like i can't concentrate so come on come back here come here don't go nowhere okay so what i'm gonna do now they said to wait a full hour actually i think they said wait two hours but we waited the hour i'm gonna start the timer again try to do more spots we'll see how many i do from now until then and uh be back in an hour i am three hours in to the edibles 10 milligrams not very much uh my berry feel it i am hungry now tank just called me and was getting his food for his breakfast slash lunch so made me super hungry and so i post me postmated some subway tuna cause that's what sounds super good right now so i'm waiting for postmates to brand says any minute now um like i said i kind of have a high tolerance so it's probably why i don't feel the edibles as much um i definitely got to boost the energy off of doing the season blinker paired with the edible i think this is so oh [ __ ] hello thank you have a good is pretty high so the um edible part wasn't gonna do much uh for the most part it is a really good level though if you don't have a high tolerance then you could probably get super baked off those um oh yes subway tuna gotta love it when you're high this is the way to go all day every day and it's healthy it's good for my run tomorrow it's good for my run that i did today tuna fish no this has nothing to do with zombies but this is what happens when you get someone and even a but so i would say that i do like these levels i would try them again uh would i buy them uh they're pretty good depending on the price but uh i would definitely recommend them because like i said if you don't have that high of a tolerance then you are definitely going to feel those and they're gluten-free vegan so definitely will make a lot of people happy so we might do another follow-up in a little bit but like i said i don't expect to feel these much more but they were delicious so thanks to the corner lbc bam we'll try the other ones they gave us in a few days maybe we'll have dank take those instead see how he feels all right thanks for watching literally just posted our info on mega md i we got it on sunday i was approved actually monday it was approved [Music] dr frank and pc wow that's pretty cool they even came in a handy dandy little envelope please sounds really cool yay so now we got a wreck i would definitely recommend going through negmd nugtmd.com in your medical lab for whatever state you're in we offer a few different states and you can't beat saving money and taxes california especially long beach and santa ana they pride themselves on taxing any high but this is definitely handy i recommend you guys go get one okay it is like seven o'clock we are now t minus seven hours past the initial edible eating um after i ate the subway uh and took longer i actually felt the edibles kick in a lot stronger than they had been so i would definitely recommend them i would definitely buy them they're worth it um felt real good of course a real calm high not a very buff one but because it was only 10 milligrams but like i said once i added in the long wrap i've i think i did some packwoods lemon squeeze once i added that in took my high to a whole nother level so you guys look out for the emerald sky on weed maps we got them from at the corner lbc that's a dope house shop they know what they're doing

new to our channel would like to see more recipes please like subscribe and don't forget to click the notification button [Music] I'm specifically highlighting Loran oils because I tend to get the most compliments when I use their flavors it's very important to set everything up in advance on the stovetop I keep a cup with warm or hot water to keep my brush in and it'll be where I place my thermometer when I remove it you'll need a brush or a tool to remove sugar crystals from your pot we purchase these cute silicone bear molds which will provide a link to in the description however if you don't have a mold you can use a small lightly oiled sheet pan for your candy on medium heat add your sugar corn syrup and water and stir until it comes to a small boil [Music] periodically you want to take your brush and remove the crystals that form around your pot now that your mixture is boiling stop stirring but continue to brush the sugar crystals that form around your pot your candy will be ready when it reaches the hard crack line on your candy thermometer as you get closer to 300 you want to make sure that your oil and food coloring if you're using it are ready because once you reach hard crack stage your candy mixture becomes time sensitive now that your mixture is reached hard crack stage remove your thermometer add your food coloring if you're using it and your one dream of Lorien oils stirring continuously some oils because they're super strength have strong scents so be sure to keep your oven or your stove fan on after you remove your mixture from the heat quickly but carefully because it's very hot transfer into your molds or onto a sheet pan my husband isn't a professional videographer and I'm not a professional candy maker so this shot is a little shaky and a little sloppy however this little tool I'm using is perfect to fix my mistake so we'll be sure to add a link to this silicone spatula below whether using molds or a sheet pan let your candy cool completely before removing once your candy is cooled if you're using a sheet pan gently break your candy into bite-sized pieces and you can also sift powdered sugar over them I personally prefer molds because they don't have as many sharp edges and as you can see even with arthritic hands they easily pop out [Music] sometimes I accidentally have fill some of the molds and we end up with a bowl full of accidents which my husband is happy to dispose of there are many recipes for hard candy as you can see I have a variation including rock candy but for more candy ideas we'll put a link to Lauren's website in the description this is a great homemade gift for any occasion or any season please share your candy ideas with me in the comments below and maybe I'll make them in a future video if you

had no idea i'd be coming back to talk about them producing good products in their private labels they have not always had the greatest products their weibolic for the longest time was known as that protein that you were going to get pushed no matter what when you went into the gnc super proud today to be talking about beyond raw's lit their beyond raw line again may have not launched with the greatest of formulas but these days is actually touting some pretty good formulas they did their pump a few months back uh their rtd of the lit actually is tied for first with ghost energy for our top rtd's of 2020 and uh today we're gonna be talking about beyond raw's lit in the powder version uh specifically their flavor collab with jolly rancher now i i don't know if you guys are tired of losing me talking about flavor collabs i'm sure probably about 20 of you just nodded your heads yeah but you know i know ghost has done a really great job of pioneering this bringing it to the industry and showing the industry what can be done to legitimize this industry and i realize that most of my viewers especially on youtube maybe not instagram if some more mainstream people there uh are way more interested in like hardcore stuff but i can't state enough how much these flavor collabs help our industry out they help us legitimize our industry for mainstream consumers when mainstream consumers come to us when they say uh jolly rancher that's like wow that's a huge brand it's actually pretty cool i want to try this out this flavor i want to try it so today i'm going to talk about the formula and at the end i'm going to finish it off with a flavor of you this is completely sealed i have not tried this flavor out i'm going to put it in some cold water and try it out before we get to that you guys know i have to sit down and talk about the formula now uh we don't have a business affiliate relationship with gnc uh we were supposed to be their media group for their uh global convention this year but obviously with chronovice that didn't work out uh we are you know doing some kind of content stuff with them but i actually went and picked this up myself and wanted to do my own video on it so there's two blends in here the energy and mental intensity blend as well as the pump and no support blend now this product let's be real this is an in-house private label brand for gnc this product is meant to bring consumers to a better ingredient panel than before obviously it is improved but this is also a product that's going to have to have a higher margin for gnc they are cutting out the middleman and producing themselves but this product is going to be both aiming to be a good product and have a good margin for them they're going to want to make more money on this obviously so there's some good stuff in here there's some some stuff i would like to make better i'm gonna be honest about that but they're it is pretty net positive here and i i'm hoping at the end this flavor is pretty good carnitine beta alanine first ingredient in energy and mental intensity now i wouldn't really say that carnosyn beta alanine is really part of energy or mental intensity i guess you could say energy in terms of uh endurance energy long energy but they've got 3.2 grams of carnosine here now i'm not tied to needing carnosine i think that generic beta alanine is just fine but i hear at 3.2 grams they have uh the study dose or one of the study doses we're happy with 3.2 grams and we can move forward without talking about too much about it obviously beta alanine's gonna help add extra sets and reps onto your workouts over time it's something you need to take and actually be saturated with which happens around 179 grams in a short amount of time you have to feed yourself 3.2 grams every day for a while to keep that up over time it's going to help you out it is one of the more studied and proven ingredients in the industry so i'm happy that they put it in here it's pretty self-explanatory now here's one that i'm not all that on board with 1.5 grams of micronized creatine as creatine monohydrate now creatine monohydrate is my preferred version of creatine what 1.5 grams is not even close to the clinical dosage here now i understand why people when brands use 3 3.5 for because depending on your body weight you might not even need a full 5 grams now also with the rest of the package if you have a whole stack you're supposed to be taking i understand breaking up creatine because it doesn't need to be taken at any specific time it doesn't need to be all in one dose and well they want you to buy the whole stack honestly but here it's 1.5 grams i'm not aware of any rest of the stack that has another 3.5 grams to make it a full 5 grams but you know whatever if you're taking this product just make sure you're taking extra creatine it's a little unfortunate because crazy monitor is extremely cheap but you know gnc is gonna make their choices moving forward caffeine anhydrous 250 milligrams this is pretty middle of the road for caffeine i prefer to have a blend of short and long-term acting caffeine but at 250 milligrams it really wouldn't be that much of a difference caffeine anhydrous at 250 you're gonna feel nice um it's not overly stimulant for too many people if you're a very small female this might affect you a little bit hard uh this will mostly have to do with your caffeine tolerance so if you are a crazy uh starbucks shopper you may not have a problem with this but 250 is not all that much it's going to help wake you up but it's roughly a little bit less than a whole can of bang i love atp from ancient peat and apple extract 150 milligrams i'm a big fan of atp any stuff that that helps with energy and strength and power output is important for me i like it i think that more people should be focusing on that over just plain pump and energy this is a really great ingredient for performance athletes uh but even if you are a physique athlete your training is going to be what dictates your physique so heavier training harder training more intense training is going to translate into your body composition you need to be aware of that elevatp is a great ingredient for that purpose studies on lftp basically show that increases atp within the muscle now atp and sustaining high levels of atp is very important for high levels of training another study showed that it could increase one rep maxes of squats and deadlifts now that may be important to someone like me as a power lifter but as someone like a bodybuilder or a gym rat or crossfit or whatever that's going to translate not just in your one rep max if yours one rat max goes up you're also your rep weights are going to go up the only way to create hypertrophy is through progressive overload over time giving your body a larger stimulus now whether that's more sets more reps more weight up to you but this is going to help you increase that over time which is going to be important for hypertrophy and strength so great ingredient super happy to see them putting it in here they follow that up with a personal favorite of mine neuro factor neurofactor is an amazing ingredient that i feel more than most nootropic ingredients out there at 100 milligrams this is the clinical study dose so i'm happy to see gnc using this gnc is actually the first company i remember seeing this in their lit rtd the can i remember seeing it long time ago and being very impressed they were using something that was new um gnc's regulatory department their um research and development department i like them in some ways i don't like them in others um i was not a fan of how long it took them to include dynamine in their regulatory of allowed stuff but i do think that they do the extra step to make sure that everything is safe for their consumers i won't get too far into it because well i don't know if you guys all really care to listen to it that long but neurofactor increases this thing called bndf which is mostly concentrated in the brain it's very helpful for focus um and brain health but it also works synergistically with caffeine so you're going to have a great amount of energy for this workout using them together now the pump and no2 support ingredients here are going to be three grams of citrulline and 1.5 grams of nitrogen i'm both happy and conflicted here because i love nitrogen at 1.5 grams i get a great pump i love citrulline as well but i like to see a minimum of four grams of citrulline now there was a study at the university of arkansas last year that compared eight grams of citrulline malate which was six grams of citrulline versus 1.5 grams of nitrogen and they found that the two of them actually yielded the same amount of pump and when i was at supply side west sitting with nutrition 21 who by the way we do have a business affiliate relationship and i want to make sure that we do have a little bit of bias here i know you guys love to bring this up uh i am friends with the issues 31 i frequently go to dinner with their president joe is an amazing guy i love the stuff they make their whole team is passionate about improving this industry they are very good people and i like the products they make but their ingredients are backed by studies clinical data and human data and it's important to me and when they were presenting this data to me i was i said to them well that's great i like that these two ingredients are now in a level playing field but what happens when you take them together do we need to take these at these dosages because i think that a lot of times in these ingredients you could use a little bit less of both and yield a maybe better result at least the same result so i would have liked to see in situated four grams here that's the clinical dosage we don't have any other data to suggest that it being with neutron's gene allows you to use any less now theoretically we probably could theorize that using less citrulline would be okay alongside something like uh netraza gene which is a stabilized arginine which produces more uh nitric oxide in the body because of the way that it gets arginine to the body now citrulline also creates arginine in the body which then creates nitric oxide so we can theorize that using them together may have a synergistic effect we can use less of them but we don't know that for sure that's why i'm a little bit disappointed here with the pump product because i'd like to see one more gram of situation just one but that that is really only due to the technicality of what the studies show if there were studies out there showing citrulline and trusting together i'd be able to say well maybe this is actually synergistic or maybe maybe the data shows it is but we don't have that data we don't have a lot of companies studying ingredients together instead of you know against each other i think that a lot of the time a lot of these products we're theorizing what happens when all these ingredients get put together we don't know a lot so in any case i'm super happy that gnc went with a full dose of neutralization instead of going full of citrulline lowering the trouser gene uh but hey we're never gonna know until we start studying and trying it out um i have taken citrulline nitrogen together before and personally i do think it has a bit more of a synergistic effect so i'm not sitting here and saying that it's okay from the underdog citrulline next to the nitrogen but i can definitely say i would understand why they would again like i said in the beginning this is going to be a product that is going to deliver on results but also it's going to be a little bit of a better price point for gnc it is their private label right if you want a more expensive product a more built out product they always have uh third-party vendors for that gnc sell some great brands they now sell axe and sledge uh ghost is one of their main partners i think nutribio is still there caged muscle is there so you have a lot of options and you could actually stack a lot of the stuff with this product here uh it's one of the benefits of going to a store instead of buying straight from a brand so i've got about eight fluid ounces of cold water in this shaker cup next to me i'm gonna take a nice nice scoop of this and i'm gonna let you know what smells like jolly ranchers i'm gonna let you know if it tastes like them it's a nice deep thunk but i know that like a good percentage of you guys really only care what it tastes like so i'm joking all right cheers it'll taste just like a watermelon jolly rancher i got no complaints about flavor tastes literally just like a jolly rancher the messed up thing is i don't have a workout too after this i literally am gonna drink this and edit this video cracked out well gnc congratulations it tastes like a jolly rancher i'll let you know how how my pump is in a little bit but big fan of the energy blend here neurofactor is going to help me focus for this editing session i guess my really only complaint would be that you used a uh sleeve instead of a sticker well [Music] i'm a fan of the formula i think that it has some things that i would personally change but hey i'm just ben kane at price well i'm not gnc the you know billion dollar company they obviously know what they're doing obviously this product is gonna work for for people um some little things that i might change but maybe they know things that we don't that's absolutely fine uh there's this is why we have so many different products out there there's people that want different things and want to feel different things if you have any questions about it go over to pricewall.com gnc we also have the plum product there and pretty soon sustained protein blend girl scouts coconut caramel um we do that one sometime soon but seriously uh product is great for what you know gnc is producing i would never have thought that we'd be talking about a product this great back in the day when i left gnc um you know they've really grown over the years and i'm super proud to see them doing that in this industry as the juggernaut of the industry that they are um including brands like nutrition 21 including stuff like elevatp neuro factor i think is a huge step for the industry alongside that flav uh flavor collab in any case i really appreciate you watching if you may just point the video wow leave a comment below i want to thank you for watching this long and if you have any questions about the product just comment below as well i love talking about it in any case really thanks for watching me ramble for this long i really appreciate it and have a great day [Music] welcome to price plow [Music] my [Music]", "MTQryyFsTcw": "hey guys so uh I've been trying out these wall-e jobs for the past couple weeks I've tried pretty much all their different flavors and stuff and tried their CBD stuff and 160 milligrams ones try them in the past I got to say right off the bat I tried this one maybe about six months ago it was the same as this they were different I do feel like now they do get me a little higher but back when I had these for sure there was like a real strong weed flavor on the outside of them after sucking on them for a few seconds the weed flavor would go away and it was just the berry flavor this one the same exact same thing same flavor everything six months later I don't know if they found a new way to you know mix it or wet but the THC flavor was infused throughout the entire candy and it got me real nice and high I remember at some point I only had like four of these mixed in a couple of these couple of these and I was real nice and high well maybe like I took about ten hits off the vape or so so I mean it's pretty good also their heat CBD candies were really good they tasted really good but of course there's no THC in there so these the 90 milligram ones I've had a few I had a blueberry one it was pretty good I lost a little case to it but it was alright surprisingly I liked the Pina Colada ones the most and I'm not usually a fan of pina colada but out of all the 90 milligram Walli drops I like the Pina Colada the most I had a strawberry cheesecake one that I did not like at all I gave it away I gotta say that these grape ones No they kind of taste like detergent II to me not very good this also has like a really fakey flavor the blueberry was kind of fakey too but it wasn't bad he's one pina coladas are okay he's kind of pineapple e to me honestly I did not like the flavor of any of these 90 milligram while he drops I probably would not buy them again yeah all their 90 milligram while I don't know what's going on but whatever flavor they use it just tastes really fake II really chemically they do get you high then 90 milligrams is probably pretty accurate but I mean flavor-wise it's just not there what I buy these again no if I wanted CBD stuff I would buy this again though I like the peach was pretty good and if you can find it I would get the hundred and sixty milligram ones they didn't taste awesome but they weren't terrible that flavor wasn't like super fake and they got you nice and high 160 would be worth it these 90 milligram ones not so much I wouldn't get them again but I mean it's stronger than say like a crappy lol edible or something but still I mean if you have other options you can get something like this or I would probably get something else but uh I mean while he drops all in all they're okay they're not lying about the THC content so I'll still give them a thumbs up hopefully they can get better flavors in the future and yeah stay tuned for more reviews and box and stuff like that subscribe and uh catch you guys later but", "FYppuGvTvNU": "[Music] hey what's up YouTube but I just want to do a quick review of a local edible maker I asked my co-op where these came out of and again they did said the day how they I don't know they always say there's probably bad thing about living in the small town you do get a lot of stuff that is just kind of fancy name thrown on it and how we get our stuff from the bay when in reality they get right here in this area and they don't want to it's it's dumb but it's a justify 60 and 8 type stuff so anyways this is a group called candy care this is stuff was called sweet and sour this is 400 milligram these are gummy bears are not gummy bears but it's like you know like the sour patch kids that when I was a kid when my grandma or one of them I get a quarter or whatever I know I'm probably showing my age but why not get a quarter I'd run down to the penny candy store and to pick up sour patch kids or sweetest fish or you know that cost if I select the dots you know the ones that came on the piece of paper she could rip off that kind of stuff anyways this right here these DS of this little off they got the leg game warning on them but in the back it gives you the main ingredients so the way the ingredients work is the most ingredient that's in it is supposed to be number one ingredient so the number one ingredient is to sugar invert sugar which you know I'll look that up in my next review I'll explain it what that even is corn syrup which is well not good for you but high fructose is worse so this is the third ingredient so but probably to keep the sweetness in it and then the next is cannabis extract my friend corns probably tartaric acid citric acid by the natural and artificial flavoring yelling number six red number 14 number five number one so this is supposed to contain about 10 to 12 milligrams per candy and I was okay so I the most I've ever ate of these is five and it was a very good relaxing a few hours well if I probably ate more I couldn't even got more medicinal up I'm sure of course duh but as far as again as far as taste goes these are very sour which is awesome there's been a couple ones I've gotten in from larger companies who this this sour was there so much so that's why show you looking get it real close you could see it's got those crystals all over it so I'm sure that's why the sugar and the invert sugar if sure that's probably what the invert sugars but very sweet very sour and they also have you can vary in certain pieces you can really really taste the cannabis enema so this is for sure something that I've wanted to pass along if you're a cup if you can by chance get these than I would for sure get these because the medicinal effect is pretty good so this is something to check out for yourself the candy care sweet and sour 400 milligram candies please be sure share and subscribe and all that other good stuff love peace and chicken grease", "Y8dhF8XPCDs": "oh wait oh i think i have the wrong lens covered up hold on oh and is it this one is it further down there we go oh you know what we'll just put it up here this looks better all right we know what we're doing we're getting there so for the people who are just joining us uh we mentioned on the last video you know what i can actually face the camera to myself uh we mentioned on the last video oh

it's the flavoring for the next batch coffee oh coffee traffic flavor all right someone said new wi-fi yeah it is how would you know oh well because we uh we mentioned it in a recent video oh okay that's a dead giveaway man yeah that'll do it do we make they're supposed to keep those secrets though right yeah the video secrets yeah we only posted it to youtube so oh okay okay they know better yeah yeah yeah like lion man or too it was like down to like 307 point whatever and i looked away for two seconds look back over nine and a half you know someone wants to know if we've seen the new borah no yeah yeah i said it is it good yeah it's pretty good compared to the original what did you think is it as good or uh i mean you kind of know what to expect going in you can see in the original but uh it held up nicely yeah i like it good stuff um yeah i feel like the whole thing with the first one was uh not knowing if it was real or not and still there's still an element of that in it people like did they talk to a bunch of people who maybe hadn't seen the first one yeah it seemed like they were talking to people that didn't know what was going on i have a whole lot more shots to put in here so i'm going to put it in players i think it's it's 13.3 you're saying right you guys could probably measure this by the cup then yeah no we definitely could except i'm not entirely convinced that this is only one ounce uh dylan could you go grab another microphone another shotgun microphone right you got it i got my minion on it because he was saying that the uh the wi-fi um it's kind of giving like a weird static sound every now and then which is great that i can have somebody in the building who'd let me know about the weird sounds yeah someone's just saying they hear static so we're gonna get that fixed we're gonna grab a different microphone that does not have static it doesn't pick up static ah that's getting real high yes it is so we got our first step super chat from christine ponton love you guys hey max heart heart uh all right so we're gonna put this down for a second and i'm going to put on a different microphone so you guys will you know i'll be back in just a second with the audio okay so that should fix the audio issues uh it looks like we got another super chat i've got a couple of other super chats um scott eisemann says where's helga well there's your answer and then we got a super chat from somebody else here comes before thank you everyone for the super chats this smells like a cup of coffee strong yeah i'm telling you we have any uh questions over there dylan i know you're right now people are just shouting out where they're from where they're from someone just like keep up the good work that's some good advice they've been watching for a while yeah someone's asking about making tropical candy well we do have a tropical candy uh box of uh assorted chocolates tropical treasures and i think we still have i

kind of mike for you kind of okay someone wants to know what you guys are making and also someone said we need a moderator for the chat i'm pretty sure we've got about at least six moderators in the chat right now we need seven also we have dylan over there on the laptop so i think we're good yeah dylan's there to let me know if there's any audio or wi-fi issues so so far so good and looks like we got another super chat uh from why bunny girl i'm watching from my dentist exam chair good luck um adam sent uh a super chat says flavor it's 3 35 a.m here in australia and first time i have been

watching from her yoga mat are you doing yoga while you're doing this oh um i got the spoons over there that should make it that might keep the color from bleeding out a little bit yep why is the video quality slowing a little bad because it's a live stream not a where are the 4k live streams yeah no usually i mean often we will use uh my actual camera for my live streams um but this is much more portable so in between batches since i'm on my phone then i can actually go to other parts of the building instead of being stuck on a cord and then i am pretty limited um yeah that's a tough one i mean we've thought about doing like novelties i guess the pb j is probably the craziest yeah i keep pushing for like i want to do like hot dog flavor or something like cream corn fillings yeah but we're not quite there yet yeah could do some mystery flavors let people guess uh kirsty sent a five pound super superchat thank you hello from uk after a long week at work this is just what i needed stay safe guys you're all incredible oh nice stay safe too so i said flavor this is coffee flavor this is coffee yep you can't smell it smell vision must be off yeah we're working on it light roast or

pretty quick with the chats so if you have something that you definitely 100 want to get answered sending a super chat is the best way to do it because there's so many people commenting that's hard for me to read them all obviously uh it's almost like we make dye free candy i think my mom hasn't talked about doing that before yeah because that's got brown in it and that doesn't but that's got to

she's a seasonal worker she's only here like mostly just for october yeah uh derek thomason is a super chat where's steve i can change if i have a hat where do you think he is he's going to put on different ads yeah um when the uk sent a super chat do you have much waste what do you do with it um not with the hard candy the ribbon we have a little bit but we always find somebody to give our candy to your your parents don't mind taking some help especially if i have to if i have to chop a candy open so you can see the cross section like for the website then i was like all right max and candy and they they always cry and cry when i get home drivers friends and friends delivery drivers love coming here yeah no kidding let's try to get all our thanks and have a great day i would probably get the chips that's like our staple chocolate covered chicken yeah you know when you first hear about chocolate chips it always sounds a little funky but like here so good do you have any uh chocolate covered peanut butter left there oh yeah chocolate covered pecan brittle i actually hate my favorite so and then there's i mean you really can't go wrong with the uh assorted chocolates yeah and then also in my opinion the fruit and friendly is some of the best candy planet star wolf dragon santa claus root for that you guys do make blueberry candy it's kind of my fave i don't know you guys and or not i i keep it up guys we're uh we're not making the blueberry today but we've got blue raspberry packaged yeah by itself and i think the blueberry is in the most recent um fruit friendly i want to say but the flavorless should be up there on the website yeah uh whitney sent a two dollar bag hey guys keep up the positivity love you guys well thanks hey thank you yeah uh natalie sent me super chat uh i received my candy order and thanks for the note you enclosed uh i'm trying to think which one it is but i i remember writing a note to a natalie yeah but you're welcome i'm glad you liked it builder's marks on a two dollar super chat what about a blackberry lemonade twist there's like not too many uh hard candy combinations that wouldn't taste good i wouldn't mind getting the black raspberry though yeah i had black raspberry lemonade this uh past summer well not this past month the summer before that it was the best three i ever consumed okay it was incredible we have uh black raspberries that grow on the side of our house every year i didn't need a single one this year uh someone said oh yeah people have been asking about like eggnog flavored uh assorted chocolates and maybe hard candy i think we have an eggnog flavor oh do we i think it's like you know from back to today yeah so we'd have to replace it which one do you think i think oh yeah definitely yeah anything mango is my favorite yeah i ate like a whole pack of dried mango last night i'm feeling it right now yeah that mangoes killer yeah uh youtube shark it's not an 85 superchat you guys could do a blackberry flavored hard candy that tastes like a blackberry fruit i mean that makes sense yeah because black candy like it was it was actually colored black i don't think people have black food do we no i don't know if there is black food coloring his white took us a while back dude start squeezing out those sharpies um yeah i mean we can even like put a bunch of seeds in it so it's like really like eating the blackberry oh noah says hello from syracuse i've heard of that place yeah annabelle says hello from buffalo that's true there's a lot of local people and not local wow yeah well i guess a lot of people can't come visit now in one lifetime yeah keep those youtube secrets yeah uh lisa cena said i love you guys i make hard candy using hero wish i could get the big tub of food you guys use my kids would love me with extra laundry oh i bet that's not possible if your mom making hard candy for your kids yeah the main ingredient is love i think it's sugar yeah judging by all the comments of people saying what's well it's candy okay yeah we got two super chats uh one from chloe again thank you for sending all the super chat today chloe uh black food coloring can stain your teeth if you're not careful permanently forever wow um more santa super chat hello from poland uh i love your videos they're the highlights of my days and these hard times stay safe and healthy love you all well you too thank you you guys thick hair up there yeah licorice hard candy yeah i can see that people being black and byron just posted a link to the website for anyone who does want to place an order uh he from the uk been the last few years well thanks mike that is your real name he's got a certain last name that i would say i think you figured it out he's trying he's trying to trick me hi from pennsylvania dylan you're sitting right there you're not tricking anybody uh would you guys ever consider doing an apple cider flavored or heart candy for fruit and friendly or the spice pack i think that's probably going to be the next flavor in our in our fallen friendly one oh yeah well i mean now that you suggested it i don't mean we were thinking about it right right yeah uh so it says what flavor is this this is coffee flavor if you've ever had dove's espresso ice cream this reminds me of yeah like it's spot on all right that one's pretty quick nice and smooth yeah we're only at i guess we'll go see what everyone else is up to i guess we'll probably see what my dad's up to first and we'll see if the girls are up there oh my mom want to make an all right well we'll go take my mom there's the last of this batch oh do we do jugger beer no we don't have anything ginger beer that would probably be really good though uh root beer this is all the coffee flavor and then we did cranberry and what else is over here pumpkin yeah okay so we got pumpkin cranberry coffee and then earlier there was uh strawberry lemonade looks like we've got a ghost in here that's it oh well i must watch right by her you can see me yeah i have a question for y'all so somebody said in a comment on an order when she was ordering the watermelon hard candy she said when she was a little kid she used to get a transparent watermelon hard candy they called it candy glass my question is is anybody interested in us making like a whole batch of transparent candy because all we have to do is really not pull it on the hook yeah because the watermelon has a nice pink color to it so that'd be kind of cool transparent um i know the cherry looks pretty cool transparent that would be a red but like what flavors would you be interested in and are you interested at all or is it just one person that wants clear watermelon it looks like everyone's just saying yes yes yeah yeah i don't imagine people would not be interested you never know i mean do you want to be able to use your camera i will unsubscribe immediately i want to be able to read my paper through my candy yeah so i was just wondering if that's interesting we're not trying to reinvent the wheel we're just reinventing hard candy not like the some of the darker colors aren't going to lend themselves well to that but i was just wondering if anybody's interested sure that's really all i have to say about that all right i'll let you get back to it and then uh i guess i'll go see what dad's up to good luck with that all right he might be in there he might not he gets away yeah yeah he wanders away and if you've had your back to him could you head your back to him yeah could walk he might turn into helga no yeah

bigger uh kellen sent a three-dollar super cat should i put a cooler pack shipping to new york city it depends on the temperature but probably yes i think right now up to like seven days it's gonna be really nice they need one i mean if you wait like another month you probably don't need to yeah or even maybe just a couple weeks if you're getting it like now then yeah um uh 2 30 so we gotta wait until we get to about 308 when you say dylan someone said wow you guys are really cranking out the candy today or really cranking out the candy yeah yeah now this is like a usual day for them yeah how many batches i was gonna say you guys are well i mean you guys do have a lot of baskets today it's like what at least seven batches when you guys do hard candy there's only six okay we did it we were gonna do another one uh peppermint for uh steve to make clark but yeah we had enough time uh at the end of the day yesterday oh yeah we did uh what did we do yesterday we didn't bring them all right or brittle yeah you guys you did mostly brittle but then at the end of the day we did a batch of hard candy peppermint yeah you got the first time ever doing that yeah yeah we we tried to do the peppermint last night to save us time today and then we wound up replacing the 18 pound batch equipment for the 24 pound batch it's very very lemonade so yeah and you guys we're going to do a green apple today but then you ran out um well we have we have like another green apple it's just not colored i don't think this one was like dyed and stuff but uh so we gotta just still be doing it but just adding the green apple yeah we'll just have to color it and we might put like another shot of citric acid in there or something just make it rip tangie uh cherry cherry sent a five hour trip hello hercules so happy to see live again would you ever consider a vintage assortment with root beer lemon drops sassafras cinnamon etc um i would say that not any plant anytime soon but i wouldn't rule it out yeah you know consider it there's no reason we would be against it uh and then dylan sent another super dad thank you dylan for all super cats from pennsylvania uh another fruit and friendly flavor i saw you could do someone said in the chat uh could be dragon first yeah that'd be good that would be good yeah yeah we could do like uh like tropical yeah yeah with like dragon fruit passion fruit star fruit oh yeah [Music] i used to do stuff like that these are like crazy sharp too yeah they're all really really scared to put a paper towel on yeah this always reminds me of like the game at the fair where it's like all the horses and you gotta spray the water in it oh yeah i'm talking about uh yeah play that game all the time any other questions done um not really people are just wondering about different flavors and things like and they're also asking shipping questions with ice packs oh okay so we're gonna answer this question then we'll probably go find my mom and we can ask about it yeah we'll go through so everyone store up your shipping questions we're about to go ask my mom but planet star wolf garden says uh what is the favorite candy and what is a popular candy so i guess what's the most popular candy and what's up your favorite candied i think it's the potato chips chocolate covered taste tips and they started chocolates yeah and then then after that i don't know but gingko has been max has been doing shipping um yeah a lot of the the peanut butter bark the chip bark um tons of hard candy's been going recently the blue raspberry the watermelon the tropical um people love the ribbon uh filled or otherwise but yeah i'd say the chips and the assorteds are probably the biggest the assorted there's like an assorted box in every single order yeah yeah nothing is not popular everything i put like four or five like chocolate apples in an order the other day uh katie sent a two pound super chat you guys make me smile my dream is to visit that's awesome thank you i hope we do get to visit you one day when this whole plague is over uh so we're gonna go over to mom and let's see if anyone has any shipping questions now is the time to ask oh where'd she go oh yeah this is her new standing desk oh there she is you found me yeah so uh people want to know about like uh cold packs and stuff like that do i need a cold pack to north dakota so can use it just explain how people can find out if they need a cold pack yes actually the easiest way because i could tell you a bunch of stuff and then your head will be too full because yeah if we just answer everyone's question do you need to north dakota yes or no or do you need to virginia yes or no it's just easier for other people to figure it out if they go to the website yeah basically um when you put something in your shopping cart there's going to be all this printing at the top and it tells you that you're um so like like north dakota if your temperatures are um below 68 and they probably are you probably won't you don't need a cold pack but just follow the guidelines here so if the temperatures are above 68 and you're ordering chocolate you do need a coal pack if you're ordering hard candy and it's up to 85 degrees you still don't need a cold pack but north dakota is like four or five days away so uh that's my answer to that yeah got another one uh yeah so people just like go to the website and then people always want to know like how much they will send us messages or emails saying how much will it cost so if you can tell people how they'll be able to calculate the shipping themselves so they don't have to ask easy peasy put something in your shopping cart anything and then it again it'll take you to the shopping cart page so let's just put some something that's not sold out yeah chocolate chunks we always have those yeah we're trying to keep up okay so we're just going to add that to our shopping cart and it takes us this page with all this writing and then that's when you can figure out if you need shipping or not yeah you just read that so if you need shipping you didn't hold back i i joke i joke and talk is it yeah never done it before but anyways at the bottom of this page it says shipping rates calculator so then that's we just want to put in oh my god i'll do new york because that's where i am and i know some zip codes in new york and i'll do our zip code 13057 calculate the shipping rates and it tells you the shipping rates from the least expensive so if i want to ship to myself right here they would take this over the ups facility yes craig mom santa claus just sent us a super chat that's how looking forward to holiday candy well we do help santa claus out yeah because santa even with all the elves he can't do it all himself yeah so he does come here takes what he needs leaves us a list is deductible on our taxes and everybody wins everybody wins so that's the shipping calculator okay yeah so then if you put anything in your car once you put in your cart you know it's not like a solid contract yeah you don't have to buy it you can abandon your car you can find out how much it costs you can click that x and abolish it yeah so yeah that's what i have to say about that what else you got uh other people want to know why we don't show apos oh because that's the post office and um we've had less than good luck with the post office and also it would involve us going to the post office and we don't really have staff to do that so that's the main reason there and then other people want to know like why we can't ship to australia or japan like just other a lot of some other countries all the other countries each country has its own restrictions japan the um ingredients has to be in japanese um we have been shipping to germany all along and i just ran into a roadblock yesterday they wanted um instead of just the ingredients they wanted a breakdown by percentage of weight of glucose starches sugars it's like ah game over yeah so now i had to take germany out of the mix and i've been shipping to germany all along but this package ran into it so it's probably gonna get sent back to me and i'm gonna have to refund her so the reason that you can't do stuff like that is because it would take so much time and well no it's labeling requirements right like i mean i would have to actually send this to a lab to get each thing analyzed right and then but a lot but it's labeling restrictions is usually what it is or some places they don't allow the importation of things with milk in them so the milk chocolate or the dark chocolate and in australia on top of labeling restrictions they're also the fastest an item can get to them is seven days even with the fastest shipping and because it's so hot hard candies would be melted into a clump the chocolate would be liquefied so it's just not worth it i have i did ship a sweatshirt to australia last week that one can get there and for me to do that i had to actually go into my administration yeah enable australian shipping and then he quick paid for it and then i disabled because i don't want people thinking they can order it because they can't because we the labeling law is there so i mean i can make things like that happen yeah but people can order from all over the world they can order all any of our merch on teespring right because that'll just that just gets drop shipped to them we don't have to deal with anything probably the shipping's a lot cheaper because it's closer to them yeah uh so william mann said where can i get that mouse the vertical mouse oh amazon maybe craig will put a link to it later on yeah i can't i can't do it right now good yeah but yeah it's a vertical mouse from amazon actually maybe i can get uh dylan to post that yeah i can't remember what brand it is yeah if you just type an ergonomic mouse into amazon it'll probably pop right up i can't see what the brand is what else you got uh i think that's it for right now this is my student my new stand-up desk oh yeah well well so this is the preview for people who will probably have it in the next video check it out it's got a lever here so it's hydraulic so i can just squeeze the lever and gently push it down so it's not ratcheted yeah so it's nice and smooth yeah so this is better because sitting is a new smoking yeah and i was just doing too much sitting so i stand you're hurting your back yes this is so much better yeah all right well i guess we'll go back to the introduction good talk did you find your dad yeah eventually hello if i'd go try to find him again probably won't oh well yeah he'll be gone again yeah he's violent yeah oh you guys have a lot a lot to pack up oh we weren't making candy what where is it yeah i had that at his wedding don't tell my mom dia clothing said i ordered from the uk alexandra says what she said the lifestream's going so fast it's hard to read all the comments i'm like hey yo just waking up and you guys are live awesome uh cam chan sent a super chat five dollars how far in advance should a wedding party order all right so we're gonna ask my mom that yep so mom would know yeah oh is the dad putting that on there gonna ask my mom i've got another question for you all right uh cam chan wants to know how far in advance should a wedding party favor order be placed for a group of 500 and will i have to pick up from new york thanks from washington dc okay if you order from the website anything on the website is shippable so you do not have to pick it up from new york and for 500 i would say if you can give us 60 days that would be a super good idea cool does the time of year matter like if it's if it's hot oh i was thinking like when it's like closer to christmas because you guys might be more well even still i asked for 60 days right and at that point it doesn't matter it has a wedding name on it or merry christmas yeah it's still gonna get made in the order that it was received all right i don't know 500 people well i mean i know you guys i know of 500 people you know very well 500 people right yeah anywho all right see ya also now said nice mask mom sophie i think that was one of our subscribers we often got a subscriber sending us masks and stuff our subscribers are very creative you know how it's pulled the other one in in uh so i found out did you know you were thinking it's a fair court i guess it's really it's a fair cost like that's just another colloquialism from britain yeah i got an important question yeah people are asking about uh sugar-free candy for people that might be diabetic or things like that so do we know what options we have that are sugar cream sugar-free chocolate yep right i think we mostly just have trunks but they're sugar-free clusters now too yeah so they are got sugar-free chunks in milk and dark and i think we also have sugar-free clusters of some kind i'm not super familiar with the sugar-free that's all steve's job this the hard kitty definitely not sugar-free yeah i don't even know what we would do yeah that's that'd be a lot of stevia you know you're like thousands of dollars i don't know do we ship overseas uh they wanna know specifically england yeah england's probably like the most common far away country right yeah yeah besides canada right yeah yeah that's right over the border we're like just two hours away yeah yeah we could literally drive it to canada yeah basically that's a different world you know my mom's from fulton what do you mean you wouldn't be saying that she's canadian or no she's from phoenix never mind i lied no i would never call it canadian no uh i wanna bring them down one time uh i think it was in a recent video i said canadia they got a joke and people like i hope he doesn't think it thank you it's writing the name that's what we all know if you think we said something stupid it was totally ironic that's awesome every single time i've never seen anything no someone wants to know what time is it here it's about 1 30. government oreo park are you doing the white chocolate yes i just crushed all that all off the hard candy just made it yesterday all right that's what i was saying earlier yeah favorite candy to make so what's your favorite candy man maybe peanut brittle yeah i like cheap hand brittle that's probably my favorite oh yeah that's awesome yeah yes i never knew it was going to be so good yeah uh meal times and mouthfuls in a five dollars uh what's the best time of year to come for a visit told my husband i want to come to see you well in person any time really after this is all over yeah after all this is so in a couple years i mean really i guess like the summer might be like one of the best times as far as being able to take your time like uh talking to us and um checking out the store yeah i mean it doesn't really matter though well you guys have definitely left rush trucks just after all this is over yeah that's the main otherwise any time of the year really is good we're always here uh dylan sent another super chat thank you so much dylan oh twenty electric chat this time have you thought of doing pumpkin spice or apple cider chocolate bars oh that again pumpkin spice or apple cider chocolate bars i don't know how we would do that without the flavoring oils basically yeah chocolate bars huh yeah because i i think would be more likely to make a card candy like that i mean we already did pumpkin spice but it'd just be apple cider vinegar are we allowing customers in the shop uh not at the moment no we can't trust them they don't do what they're supposed to some some people yeah some people and we're just like you know if we could just not have to deal with that we just won't especially since so many orders are coming in online and then we're also fine we're just doing uh what they call the pickup at the back side uh [Music] i'm gonna go see what the uh the temperature is at will this be online yeah of course all of our candy that is shippable is always on the website we're getting close someone said what about extremely spicy hard candy i can see that in the future i think max would be really into that 275 we got to get up to 308.5 yeah so max did you hear that someone was asking about extremely spicy hard candy and i was like i think max would be all over that oh that's i'm right up my alley yeah i don't really know i guess you would have to get like liquid capsaicin max you know one i think you would really like what mango chili maybe like spicy yeah i uh i have dried chili with mango or mango or something something like that yeah that's really good though yeah goku sent a five dollar super chat the real goku yeah uh says goku's like cougars i think it's

it or not oh someone said chocolate bacon because a lot of people have asked for that but we don't really have any pathogens any possible intestines and that came out currently and we would not like to introduce anything we'd be like governed by a different department at that point yeah they're not legal yeah the vegan police would come knocking on the door immediately no blacktop here or anything we'd have to buy like that pre-cooked like microwave bacon nobody wants that wouldn't be the same yeah uh someone just said how do you order they went to the website and there's not a list of available stuff that's available in prices um i mean if you go to the website um it should say what's in stock and it'll say right next to what the price is so did you go to the wrong website or yeah

really good honestly yeah like lucky charm i could see like cinnamon water yeah cinnamon toast crunch salt berries dewey shipped to new zealand actually i don't know i feel like we were just talking about that but i'm not sure either i think new zealand has a lot of restrictions oh yeah so that's a solid maybe a very solid hammer slap 75.00 what about a form on the website for people to submit their awesome product ideas i don't think my mom would go for that because she kind of doesn't really like when people say you when they start the sentences but you should you get enough in the comments she's got so much comments if it's if enough people comment it we'll see it in the comments anyway if only one person is asking for it probably not that many people want it yeah i mean you guys could put it up there and then like the more thumbs up it gets or something we go down yeah i mean honestly if we ever say that we're ever going to try anything new it's always pretty much going to be people saying yes yeah there's not too many flavors that wouldn't work as candy yeah not a whole you lot them count for me joe that's two three okay four how many more at least eight all right five more niner and serum you know i'm not so great at that uh oh my wow that smells so good it like it's literally just liquid apple pie in here can you guys smell that at home just get an apple pie

roller i don't think we we're not making any jelly beans or anything though but maybe someday yeah or like you know jawbreakers i think it would be really great someday if we're able to move to a bigger location we have more things and more people in the building so we can get more things done different kinds and i think max and i and joe actually were talking the other day about like someday in the future we got like a bigger place now this is like years in the future and it's a maybe we were saying i think it would be cool if uh we could like you guys could like play video games or something like madden or whatever games you guys want and you know viewers could watch and comment on anything um or just live stream something other than candy like you guys all just hanging out like maybe jamming yeah we were just watching football playing guitar yeah um yeah i think that would be cool too but we need a bigger facility oh that's a good sound but yeah so chloe's sent another super chat she's been selling a bunch today uh the oreo bark steve is making now with a hard candy looks like fruity pebble cereal oh yeah people had um a comment they're asking if you guys have ever

good how do you guys think i think it was pretty good we got another super chat from milton's mouthfuls thanks for all super chats today uh what first candy your dad learned to make see when i was a kid they sat me down with um just milk chocolate to do molds oh yeah please don't be it all by hand it sure is first thing i ever did was unmold candy i think that was it yeah yeah well i told you my first job was stamping bags with hercules candy company and name of the old and ink oh yeah and someone said why not just pour the candy like from the cuddle like you've done before um yeah i mean i could have but it's it's pretty warm so it's not going to harden right off or anything because i have to work with it warm so it wouldn't really matter either way because you're going to i have to wait for it to cool down but i can't put it down cold because then it'll harden up on here too fast even if i poured it on it would harden before i get a chance to yeah mix it all up and so it has to be kind of warm yeah uh nico pico sent another two dollar super chat uh have you guys ever made bubble gum no that'd be interesting i don't know how you would even make it though i don't know anything about bubblegum yeah uh metal bugs games send a five pound super chat as i cannot afford to get your candy to uk i will give money this way as you all deserve it as your candy looks so fine well thank you oh that's very nice over here yeah we appreciate the support after a little bit of this let's go back into the hard candy been watching since you have 35 000 subscribers question for steve have you ever made your own in-home chocolate or possibly ever considered it oh yeah i've looked into it and i've considered it but it's uh it takes up too much time yeah because i'd have to have more time and a bigger building too right to uh do that most of the day in the bar yeah because then i wouldn't be able to make the candy itself right here so it's kind of i'd name two of me if you could call me or something yeah uh midnight gaming eight seventy-five super chat have you always wanted to try i have always wanted to try or got candy with what's something you sell with the most chocolate i guess chocolate chunks chocolate chunks is the best deal here actually yeah yeah it's good good price and uh get a good amount of can of chocolate now i got to get my fingers right down in there and mix up all the hard candy pieces otherwise they'll sit on the bottom and then you turn it over when it's dry and it'll all be on the bottom just see it yeah let's see you know all that would be on the bottom we got super chat from petroglyph 75 can't afford the candy i want to support the bestest candy store in the world you even have batman working there all right let's go see what they're up to okay the one that i was really excited about though was ctr like you'll see him for the first two seconds and then you're like where'd craig go and then like he's in first place and it's done all right milton's mouthful another super chat um over here i know uh five dollars it says what's the difference between pulling and the machines you see pulling taffy i don't think there's a difference um the machine's taffy gets pulled for like 30 minutes yeah which is that's a lot of work for a human yeah so it's pretty much the same thing um this goes for way longer right you'd have to be a lot stronger to do that yeah so i i think what she was trying to say is like why does this yeah like is there any certain situation you would want to use a hook or or like a certain different situation to use um we don't know how to make that be i don't know how they keep it soft because if we were to pull ours that long it would be more and more and more and more air into it and the more air you beat into the candy the crunchier the candy yeah so i don't know what they do with taffy i've seen them like putting maybe simple syrup on it or something to keep it soft yeah i don't know um but yeah if you're going for color or texture you throw on the hook if you're actually trying to make tacking you do the tapping or i'm sure that you can use the taxpayers for that too just take it off early yeah oh anyone wants someone wants to know if we're playing the new call of duty coming out i don't know there was one yeah call of duty 89. modern warfare 13 it's the call it's cold war the cold one dylan's always kept up to date on the video games with like ronald reagan on him oh yeah that looks pretty cool it looks cool but they've they've lost they've lost my uh a while ago just just one of these yeah uh hammer slaps another while we're getting a lot of people just repeating super chats but thank you we super appreciate all you guys doing super chats um five dollars it says another candy idea i like the peppermint and oreos in white chocolate but it's graham crackers and apple pie candy in white chocolate wow so so that should basically be like uh apple pie with white chocolate the grandchildren kind of be like the crust you could probably sell your dad on anything outside uh aaron season i found out super chat this is for kara to help recoup her paycheck karen needs food for the week like 10 more mistakes yes uh george place sent a five-year-old super chat greetings from germany my order arrived really early pecan brittle and white cashew bark almond brittle tasted a bit different uh almonds are oiler than ours okay so over there is over here yeah that is interesting i've heard that chocolate tastes different in europe too yeah uh matthew taylor's on a 15 super chat thank you for your generosity and matthew uh so he said hey guys all of you are so positive and seem to really enjoy what you do love you well thanks that's that's super positive that's yeah yeah i feel like because we're like you know pretty positive happy people who like our jobs we tend to attract other people who uh i mean um oh yeah yeah do you see that question by evan oh i'm trying to see i'm like looking back and forth uh you guys should do a d and d oh yeah i would love to see what kind of characters everyone play i've never played but dylan dillon like before this whole schmorn schmidt happened i wanted to try it yes and i have people in my life that know how to do it just everything hit at the wrong time yeah maybe maybe at some point if we get more knowledgeable that would be fun yeah that's what that's what i was saying before is like someday in the future i think it would be cool to be able to live stream or just like hang out with our viewers doing something other than just candy making yeah and you know i think it'd be cool uh so midnight gaming sent and uh super chats uh what bark is your dad making he's making peppermint oreo white chocolate bark i better stop making bark and meal times and mouths will send another super chat if you guys made a candy that represented your favorite tv show what would it be i would say probably milk steak chocolate covered milk steak and our finest jelly beans served raw of course no cheese no uh no pretzel day references in there yeah that would be my vote so yours would be like pretzel day chocolate pretzels like with all the works yeah with the words uh jiggly cheesecake sent a five dollar superman i think you're gonna say that's the next candle uh hi how are you guys handling schmovid has business been slower actually business has been a booming yeah basically just because uh one of our videos went viral a while ago um and it's just been it's going really well ever since um and i've actually been limited on how many videos i can post because of that uh so chloe said another super chat have you ever considered honey flavored candy um mom was talking about something honey yeah yeah a lot of it is just a matter of finding the flavors like the flavoring oils how many would be a little difficult because it is sugar yeah so we might be able to incorporate it right into the batch yeah uh oh wait you already threw on there right yo yeah vila style 84's dentist loves you guys i bet he does yeah if only we had a oh someone just said i just thought of bailey's hard drive mean honestly like a liqueur flavor around christmas or something yeah that'd be pretty cool yeah we used to do more like irish cream stuff i love that ice cream i i think it didn't sell super well so yeah and if people can see in like the bottom right corner of the laptop they can probably see like inception of max pouring oh i want to see there's a live stream and under the corner there's a live stream of the live stream your dog dog i heard you like live streams you're thinking about sweden by the way sweetheart cheesecake has a good question what's your second favorite color orange hands down okay let me think about the hierarchy real quick there's like a um the tier list of colors yeah yeah i think we have people coming in craig that want to know what flavor to uh okay yeah so let's see what flavors are you guys doing right now right now it's apple pie apple pie flavored hard candy so we'll show what you guys have just done so that's apple pie on the hook this is coffee we made cranberry and pumpkin spice and my dad is working on peppermint oreo white chocolate bark and what are the next flavors you guys are doing a green apple kinda kinda and vanilla vanilla uh so leslie the one who said

other oh yeah we tr we time it all yeah um speaking of do you want to pull this one or you want to be closer he's been sent a lot of super chat today so thank you nico pico uh watching you guys make candy so satisfying keep on making the world a sweeter place you guys are the best yeah jasmine said my dog is sleeping don't read these and like really finish their voices let them lie chase says can i have a job i hate you guys i'm kidding you guys are the worst okay you're hired oh does pineapple go on pizza that is a very dangerous question and i would say yes i thought we said no politics so am i the only one who liked pineapple on pizza in this room they want to know where karen is she is probably at home enjoying not working all day she is taking uh what is known as a day off yesterday uh matthew sent a five dollar super chat i would really enjoy doing what you guys do but sadly there are no places near me that make candy like this hey you could be the one to start it yeah it's uh seriously i mean it takes a while to learn and everything but you'll master it eventually and then you can bring candy to your community yeah everybody needs a local candy shop caitlyn collins and another super chat remember me also heart i love their work slash videos well you sent a lot of super chats to caitlin so i do remember you and i'm not in the business kirstie loves you i think that she's going to super chat today too i don't remember everyone who sent superstars but i think she did um my favorite color was joe coloring my little pony on the floor that was really funny thank you all for saying a birthday card for my birthday card for my birthday candy and i ordered it for my kiddo i love small businesses small business touches like that you know it's hard to read something what reasons we're glad that you appreciate our little puppies yeah that's uh seriously i mean that's what it should be you know what i mean we all we're all people we're all here and then just knowing that people appreciate little touches only makes us want to do it more so you know what maybe we'll keep doing that yeah you know what i'm sending another birthday card you know what maybe we will all right so scott and i said that five dollars how about caramel filled apple ribbon i think we did that yeah all right i think that that ribbon candy is in the other room right now uh what video event went viral it was the strawberry lemonade candy video we actually made earlier today by we i meet you guys you were here yeah don't even pretend like you can make all this game dude this is for kara's paycheck for joe's mistake this is another 99. well thank you yeah just for joe's mistake uh behind mike he sent 1.50 super chat with a popcorn sticker yeah i'm loving the popcorn right here yeah well thank you mike just keeps popping up huh someone said um what piece of equipment are you guys looking forward to next and i think it would be the taffy machine that they already have yeah but we're waiting to get to use it right which a lot of people don't know about some of the new subscribers might not know about but yeah taffy's in the future just don't know when yeah we wanted to do it this summer but yeah you know we also didn't anticipate uh the whole world burning it's all the perfect but you know we like to keep smiling while the world's burning down around i mean i'm being a little bit dramatic i don't know i see smoke out there 2020 has just been last night that was like okay so you love brooklyn nine-nine i started watching i tried to find a funny part the one part that i thought was when uh the captain he was just like talking about a really awful day and he was like i don't want to sound dramatic but today has been less than ideal i thought that was actually really funny other than that you know he's probably one of my favorite characters the captain are you a big andy sandburg fan usually i over acted on that show though so i just wasn't a huge fan of him on that show but pretty much anything else i love like hot rod i love hot wheels yeah yeah so ursula moons if i go super chat can you get different designs for the pillow candy or is the diamond shaped thing oh signature um it's not necessarily a signature these machines are like 100 years old right to get the other ones is really pricey so i mean we could get like a drop candy machine or something but they're like 10 grand so yeah uh so we're just using okay and at this point this is his signature because [Music] maybe i'm thinking of it wrong but his name is kevin mcallister on the show right during the movie i think so we had an order from a kevin mcallister in the last yeah do you have mcallister i don't know maybe will you be making vegans happy i don't know if there's any non-vegans i think all as far as they know i think it's all vegan no no you know have you burned yourself while making any hard candy um yeah but mostly like on the hook yeah right yeah just we get blisters sometimes when it gets pretty hot like through the gloves yeah i i'm not saying you know seriously don't don't make hard candy at home and then touch it but there's been a couple of times where it's flush out of the kettle and lands someone wants to know what's the worst flavor we experimented with have you guys tried anything that you just weren't nope they're all amazing yeah i mean really so yeah it's kind of hard to screw up yeah chocolate peanut butter yeah i mean because we're never going to look at a candy and be like let's put a bad flavor in here you know so uh nico pico sent it in orange and cream hard candy for the question orange cream orange it's covered in white chocolate yeah the bark that's like vanilla cream or whatever it's called circle yeah yeah well i think technically we can't call it creamsicle yeah copyright or whatever um meals and mouthfuls sending another super cat anyone's everyone's favorite old school candy mom and dad too please so we'll ask you guys first then we'll go see what my dad does old school play club yeah i don't know oh i guess uh the chops are kind of old yeah i was thinking like like what are they called red hots or something i don't know i don't know red hot yeah yeah just some candy floor yeah were you over there when we used to like we'd like challenge each other to like drink a spoonful of pranks when we we're like real little yeah all right i'll still see real quick what that's their whole time candy is if they have anything uh someone wants to know if you have a favorite old time candy candy yeah yeah the chocolate drops oh yep that's that was my example yeah the chocolate chops that's the old-time candy do you have a favorite old-time candy that we have never made like one that you tried out for well we used to make an old-time candy bar with a cream center then all cream center which like the chocolate drops would with uh peanut butter or peanuts chocolate covered peanuts on over the top of it [Music] it was just a old-time candy bar my grandfather used to make it's just a simple little cluster like with a cream center and someone wants to know how old the cuddles are you think well they've been in the family uh over 100 i don't know they brought them over from the old country right they've been they were there i was a little kid so i'm almost 100 so yeah at least i live about half and an hour away from you guys here in plattsburgh uh plattsburgh's a little over an hour away more like four or five all right we'll get back to the hard candy any uh questions there dylan oh yeah yeah oh yeah there yeah we've been training for about an hour 40. oh soda flavors that would be cool yeah we've made our root beer flavored yeah i think soda would probably be real good we had cherry vanilla cola or something like that i think like a soda bad for like soda bags yeah like creamsicle fruit beer ginger beer beer yeah cola like you said dr pepper there's um orange soda yeah yeah grapeseed although how would you get like the fizzy you can you can put a carbonation caps in the candy do you remember drone soda yeah soda had uh candy for a while that fizz i guess it's the same as pop rocks are we outgrowing this shop i think so yeah we grew into it like two weeks after we got here [Music] we just need to get [Music] we're just going to set up a couple of pods off the parking lot let's look at this yeah all the houses in the neighborhoods around here rit i remember them taking us down there for the tour and being like it's kind of a little sketchy like the whole hallway system looks like a boiler room what happened to the old place uh we outgrew it that's the way the candy crumbles james p says craig i remember watching your videos congrats dude you have done your family proud well we've all done the family proud yeah mostly me i did all the hurting um i'm making a deal something oakmoon 75 pounds super debt if you turned each other into candy like terry trans or max ribbon what flavors would you choose for ourselves or for each other so like what what flavor do you represent what is your inner spirit candy yeah your spirit net yeah spirit flavor that's tough would you do mango is it just like what you like that's what i'm trying to think i'm like am i an assorted am i hard candy i wonder maybe i'll be like a mystery flavor yeah you never know what you're going to get you're the whole boss wild card yeah every crew needs a wild card uh leslie's an 85 dollar super chat uh when will you start making edibles well i don't think we will because i think we probably need another license for that uh adele is solid and also it's not uh legal i think for a recreational person in new york um but one day uh adela stylus and a5 does set would you consider making a video comparing the shop when you move to the shop now have you added or changed many things um honestly i think if you just watch the videos from that until now basically it's just this table yeah in the new rover yeah that's probably about it yeah really yeah and shelves about a hundred more shows yeah who wants to know what is the family's last name andrea or andriano depends how great they want to go are you going to go cut it i'm just good oh you did all right you were talking so i didn't want to interrupt you yeah that's okay everyone loves that's like everyone's favorite sound so you guys are doing what flavor next we are going to do green green apple yep oh yeah oh where do you guys add that color you mean i don't know he's got we don't have the right amount of the apple green apple flavoring so he's going to substitute something else oh yeah joe did you already you already cut the stuff in there too oh yeah yeah sometimes cleaning it too yeah i just cut it out there yeah you were talking and stuff and so i didn't want to interrupt yeah that's okay lilith sent a ten dollar trip i called the store last week to let you guys know about the environmentally friendly packing peanuts that are made out of starch anywhere i think mom said no because i'd like to wait for something like that well we're always looking into that stuff as soon as the as soon as the stuff is available to us yeah we're a little switch or something but yeah it depends on who we can get it from and stuff like that yeah so it depends on like availability instead yeah so so i uh if we do start doing that then we would mention in a video so oh yeah until then no work but if you see it in a video then you'll know yeah i mean our packaging and everything is uh because it's environmentally right but it's not plastic right yeah they're kind of just like the styrofoam paper labels and boxes and adam says it's time to boot the hair place next door and expand hercules call the landlord and get them relocated that's the funny thing they're the landlords yeah they're the ones i don't think they'd want us to kick the landlord though yeah yeah can we ship oh can we put iceland on the shipping list if it's not on the shipping list we probably can't you could ask your representatives yeah it's usually it's usually like restrictions yeah you keep us from uh sending to certain countries right uh and somebody else wants to know where helga is have you seen he'll go dad i saw her just leave a few minutes ago oh yeah she was laughing all the way out the door yeah did she get a new broom i think she did oh wow uh okay mill times and mouthfuls has been something a million super tests lately so i sent another one for five dollars if hercules candy was turned into a movie what would y'all who would y'all want to put who'd you have a great question yeah yeah this is meals and mouthfuls you have some of the best questions on here but who who would play you in a movie basically what after james brolin yeah i don't know i don't know oh yeah george clooney yeah and uh match would probably be uh barrel street dude 100 percent i was either going to say or jason a little tricky you might think that it's the same person you know i think the rock could play joe yep you'd have to work out a little bit more though yeah to look like joey and i think uh the guy who could play me would be the with that guy who was uh um he was in bohemian rhapsody he played what's it called oh oh oh i feel like it looks like the tiniest bit like you now yeah he was uh freddie mercury yeah let me look at him nico pico sent a two dollar super chat this would be my dream job that's it remy romney yes what's your name email remy romeo [Music] oh yeah everyone's saying that right now too once you said that oh steve martin is steve that's what somebody else does that that'd be good yeah because he's he's funny like you george i think he's imitating you yeah yeah whenever uh yeah oh leslie nielsen he's like a funny guy one thing i got white hair yep that's basically my dad hey what the heck whoa whoa whoa whoa", "yQlPMFGdOHw": "[Music] hello everyone well via weights the net one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about carrot candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for

"-9em9kqHLDY": "yo what up guys mr. reefer here bringing you another video review on another product today I got these magic pebbles you heard it right magic pebbles they're definitely very magical the reason they're magical is because they are infused with 100 milligrams of THC so you know they're definitely magic anyways today I got you guys this video review of the pebbles because I love these these are these just jumped to the top of my list of edibles that's up there with spot suits drink legal drink there's there's a bunch of other books that I haven't made complete videos for but this is I'm glad I'm doing this now because this is definitely one of the top 5 I would say at least for edibles these are amazing I picked these up yesterday on our daily walk with our dog me and my fiance walk our dog to our pot store and because they love her there so she's kind of famous anyways we've been getting these pre-rolls there and I just haven't had a chance to even buy any other type of like even flour or especially in our edibles so I'm glad I picked these up picked them up for 25 bucks so we got ten pieces of ten milligrams equaling a hundred milligrams of THC so each individual serving is Timnath two milligrams and I gotta say these work fast like stupid fast like it took us it takes us half an hour to walk to and from the pot store so hat we ate one outside you know we're not supposed to obviously but we ate one each outside while we were walking here before we start walking here from the pot store tip to our home and it took us I want to say like 25 to 30 minutes to get home and by the time we were home we were just [ __ ] the lid like we were ready to just have a good time and we ended up actually going to the pool afterwards our apartments which was actually pretty nice because I took another another one of these magic pebbles and while I was at the pool and we were just gone just terribly gone we're just there this I couldn't believe how fast and how hard these actually hit me don't get me wrong they're not gonna knock you on your ass it's not strong like that but it was strong to where I felt it immediately after like 30 minutes which for me is good because I mean for anybody is good why would you want to wait any longer for your high right but I feel like with me it'll both usually take up to like an hour something like that from what I noticed forty minutes to like an hour but never as fast as these and these were amazing they taste these I got these blue raspberry ones that actually taste like the little lollipops you get from you know your your doctor or your barber or whatever you know just have like a bow out of out there and the front by the desk and you just like take one at the bank you know those little lollipops little dum-dums it tastes just like that this blue raspberry but I have I'll show this right quick so if you wanna if you feel like you're reading through all through all this you can just pause it actually have I will read part of this they actually describe how they do the cannabis extraction for the edibles on here I says the cannabis extract is uh I can't even talk right now I'm so high about to eat another one by the way but anyways it says right here it's extracted using BHO i winterize with ethanol and then it's distilled leaving no residual solvents so they say they grow with passion and extract with position so it's just a magical experience and it really is I really do enjoy these and these taste so amazing and they look I mean they just looked like candy you know I had to open one because it is trouble with the wrapper I do have trouble with the wrapper I do have to use two hands and since I am recording this I need one hand so I just had to pre open it man these are these are amazing they and let me just show them the light here of the Sun my baby like and you can see the blue where these don't taste don't have an overwhelming taste of THC it tastes just it there's like small hints or whatever but it's not actual it isn't it doesn't over overwhelm and that's what that's what I really like about this and edible because I love weed but I do not love though we taste and it and most of the most like there's some dry like brownies out there that just tastes like straight up ass I'm not for that these are so much better so I would definitely recommend getting these blue raspberry good flavor just go ahead and start eating that but yeah my review are you afraid oh sorry I'm just trying to the flavor I can't describe it's just like a small hint of like marijuana but the rest is just blueberry just straight-up and they're pretty good so yeah I love these definitely gonna be picking up some more 2010 425 it's not a bad deal yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video because I'm about to enjoy this candy Almighty really another one I check these guys out man magic kitchen they were in the Southeast Washington area I Northwest Washington area I don't know I said southeast give these guys to try magic kitchen they got pebbles I think they carry there's different types of flavors for sure they got like pineapple strawberry stuff like that but I think they also have line for there's a different it's not just candy they have other stuff so I definitely give them a check check out see what's up with them but yeah that's it for this video man I'm gonna go roller joint finish this edible and then get high some more alright guys see you guys later stay lifted lift it is for", "SWOwtIkGLRU": "[Music] welcome to my complete guide on how to make edibles at home I have made edibles like tons and tons of times and I usually never D carve I weed before making the can of butter and I like making very strong potent edibles and they always come out really well so if you're trying to save some time you can totally skip that step if you want to other than that you do not have to use butter you can use any type of oil you want and before I start the tutorial I'm going to do a step by step guide with all of the math right now on how to specifically dose your edibles that guide that I'm gonna go through is going to help you in deciding what ratios and quantities to use so what you're gonna need for this whole process is going to be your weed you're gonna need one to two sticks of butter you're gonna need some water a nonstick preferably nonstick saucepan a metal meat thermometer or you could use like a laser thermometer you're also gonna need some cheesecloth it's usually in the aisle buy like all of the cooking utensils like the spatulas and stuff like that it's usually in that area and then besides that you'll just need some type of cooking sheet or baking dish or jar to solidify the butter and oh and you'll need like a grinder or something to grind up the wheat obviously but with that being said let's make some edibles so the first step when we dose our edibles is we want to find the THC percentage of our weed now I made this little chart right here for you guys in case you know maybe you didn't get your weed from the dispensary if you catch my drift if you do get your weed from the dispensary the label is going to tell you the percentage but in case you don't know so we that you just get off the street that's like hey it's pretty good it gets me high but you know it's not like super frosty top shelf [ __ ] that is gonna be typically five to ten percent THC potency higher end weed something a little bit nicer that's gonna be like eleven to fifteen percent so I would say like the ten to fifteen percentage range is probably pretty average and then if you get your weed at the dispensary it's usually gonna be fifteen percent up to even thirty percent now the national average percentage THC percentage is ten percent now that we have figured out the percentage of THC in our weed we have to do some math this is optional this part right here which I'm going to explain to you guys there is actually a THC a to THC conversion so like I was saying earlier let's say your weed has 10% THC a we're gonna multiply that by 10 to get the milligrams per grams ratio so if your weed is 10% we multiply that by 10 that is 100 milligrams of THC per gram 100 milligrams of THC M equals eighty seven point seven milligrams of THC per gram that is all very confusing and you know eighty nine point seven is close enough to 100 so for simplicity reasons I just use 101 THC to THC ratio so 100 to 100 that way you don't have to you worry about this whole conversion here we're just gonna use a one-to-one ratio in which case you can ignore this conversion so now that you have your percentage of your weed for simplicity let's just say that your weed is 10% THC or 100 milligrams of THC per gram as I was explaining before that's the national average so I made this little chart for you guys that you can also screenshot so in this chart we have this side here is going to be our available amount of weed the total milligrams per batch this is how many milligrams of THC are in each brownie or cookie each individual serving if you have 1/8 of weed which is three and a half grams that's gonna be 350 milligrams per batch if we divide that by 12 that is 29 milligrams per brownie or per cookie so obviously like I said before for a batch of 24 servings you're going to divide the total milligrams per serving by - since we're doubling it honestly if you're gonna be using a full 1/2 ounce or a full ounce of weed I would say go ahead and make a batch of 24 I mean that's entirely up to you but if you put half to a full ounce of weed into half a cup of butter it's going to taste very like earthy and weeding again this is up to you use this table for reference and you can tweak the numbers as needed so yeah guys that is how you dose edibles if you have questions just leave them in a comment and I will be happy to answer those for you and then I'm putting these full pages out here so you can screenshot them and here I have the entire step-by-step guide to actually making the butter but if you want to go ahead and screenshot this for simplicity purposes please go ahead so first grab a cookie sheet line it with some parchment paper for this batch I am not using flour like nugs I'm using our shape jar so every time we've been rolling joints or blunts and there's leftover shape we put it in this jar along with the stems so I'm going to actually wait and see how much we've accumulated and I'm gonna use that and I know it looks like super stemming and everything home but there's like a shit-ton of Keith at the bottom if you could see that in the previous clip so I'm just gonna go ahead and weigh all of the shake and stems and see what we've got over time and as far as my dosing goes I'm just gonna say that the shake is about 10% put that in the oven to the carb at 200 degrees for about 30 minutes and every like 10 minutes or so you're gonna want to take that out to kind of stir it so the surface area is even so coarsely grinding the D carved weed is going to help the butter taste cleaner but you can use a coffee grinder I just don't really recommend it and then I'm turning my stove on low and we're putting in a full cup or two sticks of butter in there along with one cup of water so you want equal butter to water ratio and what the water does is helps it to regulate its temperature regulating the temp is key with making cannabutter so once the butter is kind of melted in the water as you can see you can go ahead and add in your ground-up flour and just mix it in there and then once the mixture has started to kind of simmer like this we're gonna go ahead and take our thermometer and take the temperature so the key here is we want the time sure to always be within 160 and 200 we do not want it to be over 200 so after I let this cook for 3 hours you can do 2 to 4 hours that's what it's gonna look like go ahead and grab a dish and some cheesecloth so I'm just taking the cheesecloth and we're going to you'll have to cut it because it comes in huge pieces to fit over a bowl that's what I'm using you can also use a jar or something like that and we're gonna go ahead and pour all of that mixture into the cheesecloth [Music] so once you have that all in there you're just gonna go ahead and wring out all the butter don't squeeze too hard because the cheesecloth can rip and then you'll have to start over that's happened to me before but yeah once you wring it out all the way you'll see what it looks like when it's dry [Music] yup Phelps like literal [ __ ] so we're gonna now transfer the butter to some type of cooking dish if you don't have a glass dish like this you can use a cookie sheet I've done that before and then we're going to saran wrap this and put it in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours to solidify and then once we take it out of the fridge it's going to look like this and go ahead and take off the saran wrap and we're going to scratch the surface to see if any water has separated under the butter so if you added a lot of water throughout to regulate the temperature you'll have to crack the surface and drain the water out from the butter but since mine was good I'm good about regulating the temperature all the water evaporated from my butter while I was cooking it so now we are good to go we're making brownies so melt that butter back down put in a cup of white sugar we're gonna do 4 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract [Music] so next I'm just sifting in the dry ingredients it really makes a difference it's 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and then a cup of all-purpose flour go ahead and sift that add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of baking powder not baking soda and then go ahead and mix that up [Music] I'm putting this back into the same pan because it already has all that butter residue on it so it's like pre-greased then we're going to stick this in the oven at 350 degrees if I remember correctly for 25 minutes but don't quote me on that and this is the finished product you guys all done and ready to be eaten and I did testis and they were fired but thanks for watching", "zWERaIZJRos": "hey Andy and Dan cane Caruth macdanne cannabis review and we got another great product to show you so check it out this here is a cannabis infused lollipop but

make some nerds gummy clusters i figure all we have to do is melt down some gummy bears add some oil and roll them in nerd candy i'm gonna try two batches i don't know how gummy smell this is my first time doing it i'm gonna add some weed oil the first batch i got these german gummies from aldi's they're pretty good i picked out a lot of the red ones happy valentine's day match number two dos hattie bow and then we'll add some weed oil to that and try that with the nerds here's the setup i got this silicone tray i'm gonna put nerds in here that way when we have the melted gummy we can plop plop plop and like roll it around if that fails i just have regular molds so we'll see what we can do maybe we'll make both this is what we want to make it's a gummy rolled in nerds why can't that be an edible also i'm going to save this container and try to put my edibles in here stealth mode 10 out of 10. this crock pot is getting hot batch one of gummies i'm gonna keep the lid on i did not put the weed oil in i want to make sure they melt properly and then we'll add that in i'm not sure how long it will take to melt these gummies i have the crock pot on high i'm gonna check it every couple minutes and we'll see how fast it melts chocolates melted real fast so how about a quick little spoon and break [Music] best quarantine purchase ever it's been either five or ten minutes i'm gonna start setting timers it's not really melting yet it's the tiniest bit sticky let's give it a little longer okay this time i set a timer it's been five more minutes [Music] all right i had to touch one they do feel softer let's keep melting them [Music] five more minutes or i don't know like thirty we'll see it's already been ten more minutes let's set it for 10 this time it's definitely been 20 minutes since that crock pot is taking a really long time with the first batch of gummies let's take out the red ones and try and melt them in the microwave well that other batch is taking forever let's melt this in the microwave short 5 10 sec [Music] already progress 20 seconds no 11 seconds not even 20 seconds well they're not great they taste great they don't look great we saw that other batch well that was a little sloppy but they're melting how fantastic let's add the oil to this mix it up and then i have an idea to make our own gummy nerds that's less messy than what we just did [Music] i just i just had to just a little bit [Music] like 10 more minutes should have microwaved it that was much quicker [Music] but it might have been this type of gummy who knows but you can do it in the crock pot double boiler it's hot or you can do it in the [Music] microwave now that we have these gummies i think one addition would make them more like the nerd clusters [Music] right on top what do you think these are gonna have to cool for a while we want to get all that extra moisture out and hope they're not too sticky but i have high hopes let's just compare you know i mean i'm having a hard time telling which one is the real nerds okay it's this one [Music] so that went pretty good and okay and not so terrible and if you were hesitant to melt down your favorite gummy bear fruit snack just try it you can do it in the microwave you do it a double boiler it's a little messy but isn't life messy happy medicating", "Dq9dGtxGJjE": "hi everybody so today is another wakened day and I'll be doing a review of oh my gosh it's from cannabis no it looks like a bat in the bag let's take a sniff oh my god these baeksan oh it stinks what is the sweet woody and earthy I'm not smelling any of that but you know hoof let's take it out okay that's what it looks like and I'm dark some orange hairs in there I like doing wake and bake so seems to get the day better get it started better I should say I don't I wonder how this is gonna grind up it doesn't feel sticky so hmm it's a little stem here and then I'm gonna grind this up hopefully I'm praying that it just grinds easily cuz when you get the sticky stuff let's see I'll tell you if Bubba crushes no no it's good not sticky grinds well the effects are relaxed happy and sleepy I would say the sleep is probably at the end of the night or the end of the later on I guess yeah I'm really not smelling the sweet it stinks though so okay that's what it looks like grinded it stinks there's really I'm not smelling this sweetness but it smells like you know that smells like it smells like rotten onions that's what it smells like you know that rotten onion you could tell it's dirt but it's like it has like a very you just know that's what it smells like I was gonna say oh [ __ ] I forgot to get a tip but I have one yeah so the smell I would say is like rotten onions that smells like to me I don't okay let's let's scoop this this here and it's a nice day yay it's a nice day and I have some plans today I have to do some laundry I'm gonna do some baking I like to bake I like to bake but I went I'm high but I just if I wasn't I would still bake because you know okay so I got it I got it all in there you probably can't see but let's put a paper in their roll roll roll and that turned out nice again my rolling is getting better I think okay perfect nice and round so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to clean out this and then I'll take you guys outside babaca should get it at can abismo I'm gonna say that it it's I don't know what that you know how it's gonna taste in that part yet but guaranteed to be good I didn't tell me again anything about this he's done a review on this before mine and he didn't say anything to me so I guess it's surprise surprise Hey be back in like just enough to wash my hands and tidy up and then we'll be outside okay we're outside that's a nice day there's like nobody around which is perfect time to smoke a joint so let's see what bubba kush has to offer um join for him yeah there's a lot of there's enough smoking okay but it's not like overly a little dry going down it gives them a rotten taste like but it's pretty smooth I'll say that so what I can say about this so far is the smell is like when it's not grinded it's just like oh it's weed but it's like such a strong like it doesn't it's not that it doesn't smell good it's just like you could tell it's it's um it's just a strong strong weed after its grind it I found like it's it's not like rotten onion like it you know what I'm talking about in the bake you know like um sometimes when you go to the grocery store and you're getting a bag of onions mm-hmm and there's a rotten onion in the bag and you can already smell it smells like dirt but it also has that gross well that's what it smells like to me and smells sweet org do I taste anything sweet I taste I don't know what it is doesn't taste like onions but it's like a dirt so I guess I don't know I've never I don't know what this tastes like tastes like weed it's smooth I find that it's a little bit drying out my mouth with right now but I find this I get like a kind of like a creeper cuz it's just slowly coming in as in it's hitting my eyes first and then it's just kind of yeah it's it's I'm finding it's a creeper I hear voices it's just that's not close by mmm is you a little bit try the feeling I'm getting is it's like a nice feeling it's uh yeah like I can say it's relaxed and yeah I'm in a good mood I was already in a good mood but I'm just in a better mood now I don't really know what to like mmm so many thoughts like I'm thinking of like all the things I have to do today and and what order I'm gonna do them you you really want to plan your [ __ ] out on this that's what you know what if you are having trouble maybe um planning stuff I would this would be the stuff have a bong of this or joint of this or whatever I'll sit down here and everything just comes together like for instance I have oh don't mind my my sniffling I've got allergies and they're really summer's not too bad Falls always the worst oh there's Charlie say hi Jerry um Charlie no okay so if for instance I have laundry I have to do today I mean I wanted to get some muffins made I also am trying a new recipe for supper but you know I was like you know what should i do first type of thing and it's like all come together now because it's still morning I'm gonna start the laundry as we're slowly going into the afternoon I'm going to make the muffins and by 10:00 the muffins are done I can you know slowly start getting this recipe hey no no no no Charlie yeah so it all comes together it's uh Charlie wants to be petted right now and I um if you had yard work or fit to do to do it this is a good feeling I'm you know what I'm gonna give this just because I like the way everything is [Music] where the heck did I forgot where the lighter was [Music] oh my goodness hang on yeah but I'm gonna give this originally I was gonna put it like in the decent by close to the oh my [ __ ] but just the way and it's an indica which is great you know but I don't know I just like the feeling I'm gonna give it a roll my [ __ ] just for the the overall feeling of this and I'm solely going on the well not just solely I'm really going like not for definitely not for the smell and whatever cuz that's it doesn't it didn't smell good for me but um for just the feeling I this is very nice and you know maybe because it's wake-and-bake it just makes it that much better but I'm really liking this enjoy yeah be a happy yeah a happy Baker today I feel like baking Lots just I feel like I need lots but at the same time I think once you're done baking um you wouldn't want to bake too much because I think you you know you may get yourself in one of those positions of like [ __ ] why did I start to make this pie or like if you were I don't know say if you're doing some housecleaning today and you are like yeah I just have to wipe this one wall by the doorway well I think at the time he'd be like oh I should just wipe all of the walls and then when you started like the third wall then you'd be like what was I thinking you couldn't stop because then all the other ones are gonna be dirty so yeah I'm just gonna stick to the muffins and and this new this new supper recipe that I'm going to try and probably open the windows today because it's nice so and it's been so cold and shitty and rainy and stuff like you can't open the doors like that there's the paranoia somebody came outside next door and I'm not doing that I wasn't expecting that so you're good like that your [ __ ] you're like you're not slow to act you're like you know you know everything around you even there it's like in this perfect state [Music] if you need to move quick you can so um yeah I think that's I think that's everything I think I covered everything for you guys um get it at can abismo bubba kush it's good doesn't smell the greatest when you grind it up but um yeah it's like it it's uh it's done' approved just give me it's good though okay there's the nice sunflowers okay I'm gonna you know what I'm not going back there to do the finish through say my ending I'm Mustang over here so I can just travel in the door quickly so that's

concentrate and thc extract that concentrate on different level there threw me off um this product is made in a facility that processes coconut so be aware um so yes uh as i said there's some curious things going on here in this packaging uh as i noticed as i was getting ready to grab it for the review curiously uh i'm not sure how well it shows up there the original uh distributor manufacturer yeah manufacturer has been blacked out in sharpie for some reason uh and now there is another sticker with a different creator name on it who knows um not that worried about it and there's this big wks which i guess is probably the you know group that produces these things and with what looks to be hebrew underneath also curious um but cool so uh let's go ahead and open these 18 edibles uh fruit slabs and give them a try uh like all of our awaits reviews we're gonna do it the same way which is i'm gonna review uh this whole product here gonna do the entire 100 milligram dose uh probably it's going to take me about an hour or so to get through them all but we'll do some of them here on camera for you guys get you an impression of how they taste and here we go i was kind of curious to see what a fruit slab was going to be and this was not exactly what i was uh expecting um so here are our servings two four six eight ten as said mango puree they are fruit slabs as uh as advertised at a hundred excuse me 10 milligrams each uh and 7.2 calories so not not too high uh all right well here is our looks like somebody just got home hello dogs hello everyone hello hello um excuse me just a second sorry about that dogs excited they're excited about fruit slabs just like me let's give this first fruit slab a try there comes the weed so these um just kind of like i thought they might be we're like those um fruit roll-ups but uh that the healthy the rich kids parents gave them uh the fruit roll-ups that were like vaguely healthy for you that's what these pretty much are um there are yeah mango puree uh is exactly what this tastes like it's good it's actually pretty tasty uh there is a hefty cannabis aftertaste to that last one let's give this one a try not bad not bad at all and then again comes in the cannabis aspartase but nothing too potent and doesn't stick around too too long either um overall not bad um i would be wary it has been quite warm here in southern california so they may be a little bit stickier than they normally would be um but these are quite melty already and they are coming off without too much trouble but i can imagine on just a couple of degrees warmer and these things becoming a mess so you may want to take that into account um you want to eat these when it's not super hot out uh but you know seems to be working okay for now even if they are sticky and with that term sticky guys we'll determine if these fruit slabs are as sticky as the icky implies all right i'm gonna finish off the remaining seven as i said probably over the next hour so uh and then about two hours or so after that last one i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly if these fruit slabs are as good as we uh are hoping they are right now until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon [Music] welcome back to weeks guys it has been two and a half ish hours since i started our fruit slabs uh from wks whatever that sticker says and they're pretty good um they score higher on the novelty chart than they do on the getting you high chart but they'll still get you pretty high um i'm not as high as i've ever been on a 100 milligram edible but you know i'm certainly feeling something uh in terms of taste pretty good i actually thought um uh pretty quality stuff and the taste wasn't bad until you get to the aftertaste when there is a not insubstantial weed taste but it's survivable um these are nominally more healthy than other edibles out there so you might want to take that into account but they are also slightly or pricier at that 18 bucks so all in all a pretty i'm gonna give it a a a qualified thumbs up for the fruit slabs uh one that i don't think i'm gonna necessarily reach for every time we do a review or anytime i do a um an edible for pleasure but one that you know if it's offered to me i certainly won't turn down uh and thinking speaking of things i'm not gonna turn down i'm gonna share with you a little cherry on top normally we only do these when we really love something but you know i was feeling generous fruit slabs i was thinking you know let's stick a thumb in the eye of the healthy options i don't know how often i've ever done food for cherry on tops how apropos is that so i'm gonna give you the most unhealthy food of all candy a candy recommendation who loves you me also who loves you nerds big bumpy beans probably my favorite candy on planet earth uh what is that it's like nerds but they're like nerds and jelly beans crossed together they're amazing i'm a jelly bean lover but then you add texture of nerds it's great nerds aren't good nerds big bumpy beans amazing fruit slabs by wks pretty good and with that guys that's going to do it for this cherry on top that's then going to do it for this review here on wheats it's going to do it for this whole shebang boo until our next review be sure to stay high more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you then goodbye", "XOb3mh5eq1A":

all my [ __ ] ever RA [Music] anyway I told you guys yesterday that if it got that can of bhisma box I would do a review of the Duster yeah it does start today but here's why I'm not the box was supposed to be here this morning and Canada Post always [ __ ] around with my mail so I had to go buy some more dirty old Tim and Street lead and me and Donna have been smoking that all [ __ ] day and if I was to do a review of the other stuff what's called in that star I wouldn't be able to give you guys a good review because well you know I've already been smoking the other [ __ ] so I'm gonna wake and bake tomorrow like always and do a review of the Death Star Donna won't be here so there'll be a second video after that of Donna's review of the Death Star because she reviews the same stuff as me so there'd be two reviews one from me and one from her but that'll be tomorrow and don't get mad at me get my [ __ ] Canada Post here in Timmins Ontario they're [ __ ] I didn't want to have to smoke this dirty old Tim and street weed but I wasn't sure if my package was gonna [ __ ] be here the lady at the post office was acting like a [ __ ] Donna had to go down there and straighten her out to get my box here Donna tell him oh hang on you're kind of short I got adjusted a little for you there you go so I went there to Canada Post finish I showed the lady the Apple like the what's it called the tracking no the tracking number so I had the tracking number up and I give her the phone like this so word set so she's looking at this part up here anyways where it says delivery today so anyway she puts it in she says to me well when is this supposed to be delivered even and I said today and she then she tells me that it's on one of the delivery trucks and I questioned it saying shouldn't it say upbeat like shouldn't say out for delivery and she says oh no no our letter carriers work till six I was like it's a package yeah but the delivery guys worked till eight I said even though it just says that it's just processed here in Timmins oh yeah sometimes they don't go and switch that until right before they hit your door she sounds like come that's a lie because they scan the packages as you know when the Canada Post play it was a scanner right before they come so then I had to call back and actually speak to a supervisor I bought this package and you know what it wasn't on the truck it was braiding their damn office so I had to go back to Canada pose for a second time to get a package that was supposed to be delivered this morning and add your story that's my story right on those napkins over there um I wasn't really listening cuz I eat my sandwich but hopefully that made sense to you guys if not Donna's on the weeds so sometimes her stories are a little [ __ ] but it might have made sense like I said I wasn't listening I was eating my sandwich here the Bacon's good I really like the bacon hey there's my favorite part of the sandwich [Music] hey sure how do you know she said it a better look Houston okay I did okay we didn't know what to do today because it's been a shitty day and we have shitty weed so we figured let's do a review on the shitty weed on the shitty old dirty old way call again ya dirty old dirty old [ __ ] Tim extremely [ __ ] sakes anyway we've been smoking it all day long as you can tell daughter's already [ __ ] up no no no she's not flopped up did you join up everyone whatever you feel like it get it going anyway we've been smoking it all day actually we've been smoking it all [ __ ] week because of Canada [ __ ] post and I give it a [ __ ] two and a half out of five it gives you half of us hey so you give it half the rating I guess I give it a two and a half out of five it does the trick if you're hurting I don't know what you think that's what I think tell them what you think Hey like the rest is there where they called oh yeah Hawk and animal remember don't walk anyway I don't know why the [ __ ] I'm saying that but you have to like smoke this well we have been smoked I know it but if somebody just were together like do a bomb I'm not even a bomb let's say they got a grandma for somebody my suggestion is smoke both [ __ ] thing if you needed to go to sleep or something then you do like your three big bones right before and then maybe with a sleeping pill sleeping pills you fall asleep just like your regular Buffalo this a little bit bang you're into the [ __ ] wall man knock yourself out melon tastes like dirt it doesn't taste like third so what does that mean if it doesn't taste in there yeah if you don't taste there there's no [ __ ] good no all the rest of them not their stuff but like from cannabis melon stuff there's taste like dirt yeah you tell these from the ground so she means the good stuff tastes like dirt the bad stuff don't taste like dirt thank you what is the bad stuff tastes like it's not tasting like dirt nothing just tastes like the smell is there but it's like they squirted something on on the weed to make it smell like that like if there was a week to it it's pretty they squirted weed spray on it to make it smell like weed it's not real weed because it's printed with weed spray [Music] like that like it's like let's put it this way you know when you're walking down the road and you could smell weed in there okay sure yeah yeah like sometimes I'll be walking somewhere now smell like weed in there yeah you mean like if somebody's smoking in the neighborhood mm-hm okay well you said Sweden they're like you know yours you're walking place fields or something no somebody who smells naturally like weed in the air around here what are you saying if somebody was when you're walking and say if somebody was up the road whatever smoking a joint or something or a bomb outside or something mm-hmm you could just tell from the smell that's cheap because you don't like the good stuff stays there for a long time in the air no matter what it just stays like it sticks this stuff here of just kind of like it's there and then it's like gone you don't I don't feel paranoid on it if that helps everybody helps everybody yeah um like if you were coming to Timmins - because you have family and friends here or something smell the into the city yeah what smuggling is the button to the city weed from like tea if say if you already have to smoke with because if you came here and you were looking for some cuz you forgot at home tomorrow you're looking for some for a good time nope I don't think you have to smuggle it yeah you just bring it with you you mean we're in Canada you don't gotta smoke weed if it's from like an illegal place what illegal please you don't want to get put it in another bag you dump another one bag into another bag you lost me you don't want too many things at one time and then you're like I was telling the story quickly how I remember I told you I was gonna get a coffee before her coming here but then something happened oh what the when you hadn't picked up the package yeah okay told your story no no that's okay okay I grabbed the package from Canada Post and then I just tossed it in the backseat and on the way back I was gonna get a coffee but it was like as soon as I loved them there was like a cop here and I Drive up and in another cops I got a little bit worried about it because it should have been in the trunk Hey the cops aren't gonna open up your mail Donna won't think it's a what's in the package and you could have said shoes my [ __ ] mails in the package officer [ __ ] off and tip of my dick anyway hang on let's try this thing out [ __ ] thing we're here we got a what do you call it an Oreo donut an Oreo donut from the Tim Hortons cut that up dog let's have a look on the inside what you don't cut your thumb off this is just the PC move I don't care about nice this is just a PC night we're worried about the donut nothing nice and that's what it looks like on the inside what the [ __ ] is is called and were you donut Oh Oreo donut that's what it looks like on the inside hope you had a good look okay they put this thing back and I think it was there I hope it was there and I'm gonna try out some of this donut [Music] that's a good [ __ ] door it doesn't taste like Wario at all I think yeah I think those are little pieces of Oreo on top but the donuts so sweet you can't taste the [ __ ] cookie on top anyway I give this oh my [ __ ] out of 10 tell anybody they understand well you know what you'll try yours yeah what's the white [ __ ] like is it a cream isn't looks like Oh looks like somebody had fun with your doughnut [Music] okay it's not okay donut if you just need something sweet if you're looking for the Oreo taste it's not in that donut at all I don't even think these things up here Oreo I think it's just [ __ ] broken artificial earth so probably not real I don't think so cuz you can't taste it and this stuff in the middle that's like sweet it's kinda like a like a marshmallow texture I don't know but if you need something sweet go right ahead if you're thinking that it's gonna taste like an Oreo I don't know what's wrong with jim mertens that's our donut that's our donut thing okay so back to the weed people want to know more about the weed it's not donut breaks or it's not great yeah it's not the best weed in the world like if somebody says it's not the best weed many new rules no honestly if people sell it say for ten ten bucks a gram that's what it goes for unless you buy a billion [ __ ] grams okay well if you want a billion grams then you get a better deal but you don't really want to spend too much money on this [ __ ] when there's better weeds out there they should be treasuring five five bucks a gram yeah this is like this is like [ __ ] if you had it you couldn't give it away this is the shitty old moldy hay this is the [ __ ] nobody wants all the teenagers are selling it down at the mall this is horrible yeah tomorrow morning I'm gonna wake and bake with the Death Star she won't be here so tomorrow evening she'll do her review of the Death Star so we'll have to refuse the Death Star one for me one from her and that's tomorrow and thank [ __ ] the good weeds here the way you know what this the reviews are good for people just what I think we're gonna make it through [ __ ] video did you just think about what you said you know my [ __ ] I'm not even gonna repeat it nothing people enjoy people what other people are there it's not good for your [ __ ] chewing on it it's not good they don't I mean like it's only good for poor like what the [ __ ] where do you get these things wrong no like I met the people that just strictly like you strictly do bones some people strictly do joints well since they're making me do it bosz there's those people those people are the ones like that will do either our I don't think how we're doing the review really matters like the way you're saying it or whatever I know you kind of lost me I don't know what the [ __ ] we're talking about I can't even keep up with my own [ __ ] brain I look [ __ ] I keep up with that [ __ ] [Music] [ __ ] babies oh I should mention that if you know it it goes it's kind of like it it feels dry but it's almost like it's not a dried write out we'd like it should have been dried longer like make sure you have more than one batch if that's all you have you guys gotta see what she's doing here I gave her an old pumpkin for an ashtray and she's flicking the ashes in her own pop and while she's sitting you're talking I don't know if you see it down there she's missing it she's just flicking them past the can now like an alcoholic would exactly like an alcoholic [ __ ] sakes she's acting like a dirty old alcoholic no I didn't even know you didn't know about what no I watched you flip it well anyway um I guess that's all you got anything else you gotta say is there anything at all that you want to say I don't think she has anything to say okay so that that's it for the review of the turkey old demon street weed and oh yeah we got a new subscriber secret holder do you [ __ ] we're gonna [ __ ] off

aches that's you don't have to open it [Music]", "rMUYiFrH_54": "today's review is all four of the current ghost energy energy drinks so this is a partnership with anheuser-busch to create the rtd beverages for the ghost brand uh this won't be the only one that will be joining the lineup i do know they are working on protein rtds to replicate some of their delicious protein flavors let's talk a little bit about ghost energy and why it separates itself from the pack and other energy drinks on the market so we have sour watermelon warhead we have sour patch kid um again the collaborations with the companies love how ghost does that i think this is what orange mango tropical mango sorry and then we have citrus feedback has been phenomenal on these and another thing you really have to appreciate with ghost is the transparency they put on the formulas so if that is hard to see i will also put it in the comment box and i'll give you a quick rundown on what we are getting in ghost energy right now so per can you get 200 milligrams of natural caffeine you get one gram of taurine which is an endurance booster one gram of all car which is right here acetyl l-carnitine so that's basically a cognitive enhancer and you're also going to see that with the other aspects that are in the formula with you get the 150 milligrams of alpha gpc again that and the neuro factor at 100 milligrams are all there for your brain health brain function and focus so it's not only just giving you clean natural caffeine there's also those enhancers in there to really smooth out the caffeine half-life and make it a really really long lasting you know amount of energy not something that's just going to spike your energy and make you crash totally different here the kicker here which i really like is the 25 milligrams of estrogen at the bottom that basically enhances everything that's in the beverage as far as uptake of the ingredients truly appreciate ghost putting that in an energy drink to make those ingredients a little bit more effective so now that we know a little bit more about ghost energy uh if you haven't really followed ghost youtube at all they have hinted at maybe 10 to 12 more flavors in the future and based off what we're seeing here with the sour patch kids warheads i'm going to guess that whatever's coming to their gamer line is going to carry over to the energy line because i know they are working on a collaboration with uh i think it's like expel or whatever that uh gaming corporation is for a limited edition flavor so we're going to go right down the line here and i'm going to start with citrus i'm going to guess this is going to be something similar to sprite i'm uncertain but let's give it a go cheers legends yeah i wasn't too far off with that one i think this is a really safe flavor um that people will really enjoy kind of get a little bit of lemon in the back end there a little bit of zest from the citrus pretty standard flavor to me it's not something that's going to knock your socks off and make me want to go out and you know just buy a 12 pack of you know citrus but good change of pace yeah i would say so but definitely not something that's uh you know off the top of my head that's a must get flavor just trying it so let's move here tropical mango chocolate mango right yep tropical mango that orange can throws me off thinking it's something orange so i love mango flavored things uh this one probably is definitely peaking my interest let's give it a whirl oh yeah that mango hits you hard in the back end in the aftertaste so the tropical is kind of like your initial fruit punch you know that array of flavors that really hits your taste buds that mangoes the density of the mango really kicks in in the back end you have to let this one kind of sit on your taste buds for a little bit but you will pick up that mango and it does hit hard so this is another good one um let's see how these other two are before i kind of make my consensus here so i have not had the sour patch red berry in legend or any of the other flavors this is my first experience with it i've heard nothing but great things so going into this one with an open mind hopefully it's a home run cheers damn wow i'll tell you what you guys that love your sour patch kids love that sweetness love that red berry home run this is wow this is up there when it comes to all-time energy drink flavors just off that initial taste dan ghost ryan adam rest of the team this right here phenomenal i can kind of see why for ghost gamer it's such a very popular flavor so let's get to the last one here sour watermelon warheads i have had this in pump really really like this flavor so super pumped to try it in the energy as well cheers yeah that's ooh wow the density of that watermelon oh so unique it's like the og extend like in the black labels that jolly rancher flavor but enhanced with the sweetness of the warhead now this one is definitely for those that got a nice sweet tooth and the carbonation really kicks up the amount of flavor in it between these two i could buy a 12 pack of those in a heartbeat and i would have no problem drinking them day in and day out these two flavors lights out now citrus i would say maybe a six out of ten seven out of ten i mean it's a good change of pace definitely not something top tier that i think is a must go get but if you want to try it out i would highly suggest it and i would say the tropical mango would be around like a seven seven and a half it's good i think it needs a little bit more on the initial taste the mango's really good in the back end but the tropical flavor is a little lackluster but overall i would kind of rank them very similar to this you know one and two right here very hard between that and then i would say three and four but overall really excited about these guys when you can get your hands on them right away i would go with these two um you can roll the dice with these but again they're not my preference they may be yours but whenever i buy ghost products i'm not associated with the brand all my pennies go to price plow i always support ben mike and heather you can always use their coupon code price plow at ghostlifestyle.com save 20 off your order they should be coming out really soon in multiple locations so keep your eyes out if you give them a try let me know what you think", "huc90PBngC8": "hey everybody we're back with another recipe I might lean with wizard Labs and I'm Krista with wizard labs hope everyone is doing well today and tell them what we're doing today today I don't even know how to pronounce this but II very it's it looks like it's pronounced canary coulis cool very cool Asst yeah at work for me it's about Co ul is kalus coulis however you want to pronounce it it's fine so there is a very reputable eliquid company out there called Charlie Noble and back before all of the regulations and all that wonderful stuff he had some really good juice out there he still does but this was one of my favorite recipes that he had and it was not included in the August dates filings so he's decided to release the recipes it is readily available on his website it is the not so discontinued series and he's released three recipes so far the way he's put these things together is amazing he he breaks down each flavor and why he chose that flavor over another one why you really can't substitute something on and on and on but it's so good so what flavors are in this let's see so in this we have pretty fruity cantaloupe my flavor West which is flavors all over here how many flavors let's see one two three four five six seven there's eight flavor well actually seven flavors going in seven slavers and you're gonna have a I'm gonna have eight because I like menthol for all you people out there that like the menthol and that cool feeling yeah we're gonna menthol hers yeah we're gonna menthol mine up so the first one on the list is cantaloupe by flavor west this is a 10 mil sized bottle you can get any 10:30 and 4 ounce bottles from us you can always get larger than that now we do offer a wholesale section that does have 16 ounces and 32 ounces in gallons available for some of the more popular flavors but if you want bigger than a 10 mil it's available on our website so cantaloupe my flavor west and he's using it at 5% and we have like okay so it's a mix of we have flavor art flavor the flavor apprentice how many different mixes apprentice and flavor West I'm flavour us so we have three different um yep okay so next one is honeydew by TFA and we're using four percent of this okay again available in three different sizes next we have papaya papaya by TFA on a liquid recipes it's also known as TPA a lot of people that are just getting started in this don't realize that the flavor apprentice was previously known as the perfumers apprentice because they have a perfume side and a food flavoring side so there's the perfumers apprentice and there's the flavour so they separated it now they separated it so flavors that have been around a long time you might see under TPA okay this is papaya a third flavor papaya and we're adding a 1.5% of papaya philippine mango we're adding its by TFA and we're adding 3% okay and then sour it's gonna taste a little bit of my yeah I like that it's sour by TFA and it's half a percent then we have red summer watermelon by flavor art this is a really good flavor that's very juicy tasting right and it's also at three percents so a lot of flavorings going on we're gonna mix I'm gonna make some by email okay so and I got my 30ml right here to candy one percent right and then your menthol okay my menthol right there I'm gonna mix my month off so we're gonna suit up now and put our gloves on you want to make sure when you're working with nicotine that you are protected right not necess it yes it's not necessary if you're having a liquid that is not not enhanced with nicotine however if it does have nicotine in it I highly recommend which we are doing the minimum of gloves yeah and we are doing nicotine yes but you know there's other things you can add to this mm-hmm Finnish operatic oh right you can switch out flavours I mean this is you know it's always good to start out with a base recipe yeah and then one of your favorites and yeah and then tweak it from theirs so you find a recipe that somebody's already put together okay that they really you know you you like but it could just choose a little extra just like this you like it grab this you really like it but a little extra is gonna be by adding them as well for you yes so that's your way I can do it without menthol for some reason I just like that cool feeling so and that's not a bad thing yeah so are these enough for both of one will run at a time anyway dude you're gonna make shears and I'm gonna mix money and I'm gonna mix mine you're gonna okay so let's get at it okay so yeah so we're gonna mix with syringe say not by weight yes obviously yes we're both doing it yes so leave ER today let's start out with adding the flavors first okay and then we'll add the nicotine at the end because that's the most expensive component so if we accidentally tip the bottle over yeah we're not losing the nicotine okay so today I'm cantaloupe by flavor West and you're gonna add 1.5 milliliters okay five yeah now this does have a little dropper top on it so I don't know there's only would be sir one yeah if you're gonna do any one and then point five yeah pretty much the whole thing right it's almost know you had bubbles in it to do this that's okay nope no I'm your next time you'll do point six okay cuz I went to 0.9 all right so now you're gonna do point six which will total that's a little coupon so it's hard to see what these glasses is that is that right oh okay need to make sure that Oh got it okay yep okay okay okay that's my first flavor which is cantaloupe yeah and I'm gonna add the same amount to my by like sons I was just gonna run down through all of them like now we're sharing here right well it this way I can put the lid back on the bottle and that smells good it's not oh it's very strong cantaloupe is a really strong flavor it's a nice summer juice yeah these tooth Kate you want to rinse that one out I put this bottle back together okay and yes you do have to put the little dropper tip back on the ball because the dropper tip there's a little ball on the top of the cap so that makes sure it's sealed okay okay open all these so we'll be writing right well nobody gets billing oh that's true that one's really gonna make a mess when it's not always about like preparation and prepping puffing okay so this is cotton candy so you're gonna you rinsed your syringe off right yeah it's all set how about we go out to the next see if I can get this to get off now that one's not bad okay that one's easier this way I was come so what do I need with that is cotton candy and you're gonna add point three milliliters one three see better without these I know but it's not completely I know I know I'm gonna be very very slow and careful point three I'm still you're going with this I'm still new at this you're getting better though yeah I haven't really done many I just you know okay so I've got the honeydew in my hand which is the next one back on nope oh and you need it you need it that's right okay so there's the honeydew you're gonna add one capellini do did you rinse your syringe see that's why I need you around there are many of these things okay and the honey do I need a honeydew you're gonna do 11.2 milliliters 1.2 oh I'm looking over here yeah one point see right there point two okay so I need a hole one has to stop there right got it okay honey do for you okay honey here's your papaya oh yeah we're going to need 0.45 milliliters yeah that's not much so wow I guess that is strong the papaya is really strong it is a DFA it's TFA but it is really strong very strong it smells nice it's gonna be a very fruity juice here it's tropical yeah kind of like those what are those candies that you buy at the movie theater sour sour patch kids sour patch kids about and love those things that's what's smelling like it's gonna oh my god it's gonna taste gonna be I want to taste it well as soon as you done shakin that's all about see if it tastes like a sour frat kid right okay so you need papaya now right I need papaya and you need Philippine mango mango yes okay and I need point nine zero of Philippine that's almost one you need the main go now yeah then I need the sour which is not much of the song it's only 0.15 right so yeah I would think you wouldn't want too much sour in your juice no it just gives it enough of a bite you to where it's like oh okay this is this is more of a fruit cuz sometimes when you eat fresh fruit they have a bite to them um I know I mean look right here not even right it's it's in between the point one and point two like that yeah yeah it's just like four drops right yeah it's not much and in all fairness that's about the same amount of men thought you're gonna add to it okay to start what if I like it cieariy month.i and drops and you can add more but remember it's easier to add more menthol mmm we're making away then to take it away right like with you know food recipes and it's the same with the nicotine you know it's you can it's easier to take it away than it is to add more yeah just like with food I mean you want to add salt but not too much because you can never take away the salt right everything once once you're what there's in it's in it's in yeah and you can't take it out you know it's all about diluting at that point you know exactly and then you just yeah might as well just start over exactly okay so you need the you do the redsetter watermelon um yes I'm like smelling it with it oh wait um point 9 I don't think you did I don't think I did either you're right there's so there's like so many there's how many different flavors uh two four six seven flavors really good recipes and and that's why I think this one is really good it you can tell there's a melon in there you can tell there's a lot of things in there but you should you should only be able to notice like the top three ingredients yeah and a recipe and you so which are the top three ingredients in this recipe thing um camel oh uh huh Philippine mango and watermelon yeah okay well honey dunno it's cantaloupe honeydew and mango and watermelon my kind of I love watermelon so I'm gonna like this but when they start blending together you're not really gonna know tonight which watermelon tonight's mix yeah and the other ones that we're adding are just enhancers mhm so it's really an enhancement of the juice that you're you're making yeah and now you're gonna add your mouth so okay I would start I mean I I usually tell people to start with a drop per milliliter juice you're making so that would make like 30 drops I would start with say weights a nice hour i 10.15 on the sour so maybe just I I would start with 0.25 0.25 because you can always increase it you know like we just discussed but you mean you take back all right okay great well and you know the methyls here so tactically he says this recipe takes like a 10 day steep but they all fruits so I'm really not sure automated testing is the one I've read um it usually takes about two to three days isn't it fruits are usually within it's usually good to go right out of the gate and then it gets better and better over the next three to five days now we're doing PG and I'm making a mess on myself and we're gonna need a bigger syringe for this yeah he's going up on the syringe size there yes we're gonna add 2.7 milliliters it's not so good okay I'm gonna menthol with fruit flavors I'm just such a mad person how much did we out of this two points okay and now we're doing the BG and want to make sure to rinse your syringes too in case you didn't notice that we're doing it so VG I don't know if you can tell but I'm actually holding it with my fingernail it's very very thick so um it is 70 what 73 degrees in here do you want me to put the PPG in yours no I already did oh you did okay yeah I already trying to get the head got a tater okay so how much PG are we going with VG we're going with 21 milliliters okay and then do you want to grab another big ranch like this and put this needle tip on it hmm as soon as I get my 21 milliliter girl in with mine uh yeah that's what I'm thinking yeah because I am getting close and that's the almost well well we imported yeah in 18 and then we're done yeah so um give us some suggestions on you know what flavors you'd like to see be made yeah I mean if you've got a juice and you'd like us to make it we can you know we can make it online or on video yeah what how much of this I got one e1 milliliters now remember I use my fingernail to kind of I pulled pulled pulled and then I clipped my fingernail kind of on this thing it is it's just really so I'm happy I'm still trying to get it out of the syringe now that it's in this is why a lot of people measure by weight because measuring by syringe especially when you're doing larger amounts it gets really frustrating don't hold to hard what happens if you pull too hard then you could actually dislodge the plunger and then you have to start over yeah with your measurement yeah next time we'll measure by weight another option because you know you see how easy it is for me to pull water in here another option when you're doing vegetable glycerin is to get a graduated cylinder that's an easy way to measure for and you just pour it in there so it's really easy because it's so thick is are you gonna get these you're not gonna get the exact measurement well you can always over for a little bit yeah BG and you are diluting if you're doing it in a commercial situation would ya right yeah too much okay I mean this Jase is for you is that mine yeah okay now that we're done with the vet whoops I'm done with little-to-no 14-gauge is the largest waste okay oh yeah I mean there is larger gauges it's harder they're harder to find because they're not commonly used I mean we are using stainless steel needles where we're doing everything we can to try to make it as easy in low-cost again actually this smaller needle is probably more controlled so well and that's actually considered a large meal this looks like it's all we got nicotine and then we're done okay okay so the last thing we need to do is add the nicotine and one thing I like to do when I'm adding when I get nicotine because there's no hole you know this is a sealed container so I'll just take the syringe pop it right in I'll pull everything I need to pull out much c4 that way yeah knock it over and spill it you don't want that happening and I am only adding 0.9 milliliters okay to my mix all right point nine got it and I personally put our tops on already so you can just stick the little tip in now make sure you put your cap on got mine with month off pearl without shake six two six six six now a couple of things you can add to this before you put the cap on and seal it you can add we have multiple offer multiple different kinds of hemp extract it's very high in CBD this is our Onyx this is our platinum and this is our gold all different strengths same size bottle the different strengths and abilities strongest and we also offer Rick's mix which is 50 milligrams per milliliter so in your illiquid calculator you would measure it at 50 milligrams strength in order to get the amount you would want to add to your 30 ml or 50 ml or whatever size a bottle you're doing but you can add that right to this e-liquid even with everything else in there and get yourself some added benefit of the CBD exactly and you and you can add it to the CBD and lotions and we're gonna talk about that later on but you know yeah I mean I'm I'm interested in making a CBD lotion cuz I'm not old and my arthritis in my hands is killing me well I have one at home and I use it on my lower

sakes make sure I don't think you I don't think they want to nervous yeah okay well I don't think they want to know how far you can hear down the block I think you want to know like you know how you

Slovak sinks and that you review yet you do like kind of tons about attends yeah what do you intend on like my like my well I did it so I can read it so it's gonna be a tense everybody knows how the rating system works Donna would you guys understand what she was saying ten means it was good and one is not so good she said what number do you pick for the taste no just for the whole thing around Oh what are you gonna rate every little detail yeah I don't think anyway if you want no I don't know anybody wants you here nobody cares about the taste I think it's more about the hi I don't think when I buy my weeds I'm working so with the high over the taste the taste is always good but I'm working so with the high I like the meat you get really [ __ ] up if you're going with just a taste next time have some shitty weeds I'll give you that you can taste the [ __ ] up tonight okay well I would biggest seventh a seven so anything higher than a seven I guess you'd have to actually throw up yeah so Donna throws up and means it's good weeds that's pretty [ __ ] way of looking at it but no like I go I like how it makes me feel and if when we get to like this part and if you go beyond like like this part like it you get scared and stuff like that baby I just and you just wanna go to bed but you can't cuz like even when you close your eyes you get a little bit dizzy you know like that oh no I don't have any of those feelings that you're talking about you got different different feelings in me I feel nice and [ __ ] up and I like it and I don't feel like going to bed I feel like doing more bong tokes and I got the munchies and I'm thirsty and I was drinking pop but Donna was drinking and coughing the [ __ ] dinner and when I say coffin the [ __ ] - there yes that makes

we are going to make cannabis lollipops first things you will need are tempered candy molds to absorb the heat of 350 degree molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "ailEwNngfFg": "okay laude why woody so today I'm here to eat eat something special I know all my videos have turned to crappy product reviews and such but this is a little bit different see I have this here over sized condom now in this plane it's a brute ring but what's special about this fruit ring is that it contains 10 milligrams of THC you cannot I can't see it because my camera is busted apparently but it has a full 10 milligrams I don't know if I said grams good lower Debbie a hell of a snack wouldn't anyway decided to make this video since Colorado has officially well it's almost been a year but we officially legalized the consumption of marijuana recreationally and I think that's beautiful I have nothing against it I'd rather see somebody token and token and smoking and choking then sitting there like in the gutter but you know drinking and stinking you know I mean so don't get me wrong I love some Peter sometimes but I think this stuff is just so much better for you um edibles I don't really know much about them I mean look it's a sour fruit ring it's watermelon flavor I don't know if they really messed me up so I'm probably only going to eat half of it like on this video and just call it good until I know how how high I'm going it I'm sure employers my future employer will look at this be like man you're a pothead get the f out now is played most people cook most jobs i would work at have you know hippie and stoner bosses and such but I do it what's cool about this besides being what it is is it says specifically you know not for use by it anybody under the age of 21 this product is unlawful outside the state of Colorado and like says that unlike the back little like information vs you know the sandwich to you that's probably not that cool but to me it is because I'm a Colorado native and I've been waitin since I was 12 years old to be able to go and purchase something from a store that pertained marijuana and I did I bought this at a dispensary I went through the dispensary and got the cool little tour by really short haired semi pretty but probably lesbian girl um no I'm not stereotype and lesbian and saying y'all have short hair I love me a lipstick lesbian the long flowing beautiful hair but this one happens to be probably you know into the same kind of thing I am ladies anyway she gave me the tour it was awesome I think I'm going to go ahead and like attempt to maybe like by a couple of pre-rolls they're just combs are like that I joints but they the kind of shaped like a baseball bat and I'll tell you I stopped smoking straight for three years because it hit me like a baseball bat upside the head listening to a mud Bank Mudvayne album it made me paranoid as [ __ ] and made me think everybody was dying around me and like all my friends family were just going away worst feeling ever but I digress we're here 20 southside ass but you don't care we're here to enjoy this beautiful beautiful product so without further ado chip cooter mesh my boy um he said that he was very sad because you know something happened and now he can't like purchase for a couple years because of some issues we'll just leave it at that and so I mean this for you my brother and as an expiration date which is a November 9th this year I don't know exactly what would go bad maybe the THC you would just fizzle out of it or maybe you just start eating itself and get so high that it forgot it was tht anyway I find a way to open this it says it's not childproof but it looks pretty hard to open so luckily I got this trusty Paris sewers sir scissors it does feel like like you had like a feels like a rubber but like like a condom but like like like five times as thick it's crazy so oh it smells like that smells like weed actually that's what like fish like you would or like like a creek or a creek if you're a goddamn heck creek your head Oh sugary too hmm look at all that sugar I wonder where that weed is do you think it's like I know it's not we but I mean wonder where the THC content comes in do they like pour a bunch of THC oil up in like a batch of what will become a gelatin hello kitty um or what I don't know I'm going to see I'm going to eat half of this and I'll probably be pretty big so or at least well I can't use baked or blaze because I guess I'm not smoking nothing I'll be I'll be I'll be dogged I'm gonna be sewn armed in a minute alright so that's about half will go hmm um ok so for those of you who have never had him it has like a house kind of a raw sewage taste have I taste of raw sewage no but I have been in like drainage ditches and my drainage ditches and mike has that same smell as like the cattails of Webster lake while you probably don't know where that is but it used to be this area where they're just a bunch of cattails everywhere and I had like this swampy stand that's what it tastes like like a small like a swamp that's kind of fun to say no I'm not even high yeah duh but I am acting like a fool so I guess I'm gonna wait at a half hour and see how it affects me and maybe just eat the rest it was about three bucks not so bad it's probably not worth I don't know find out worth three bucks but the Colorado bud tax is like higher than I'm gonna be I'll tell you that's my video subscribe like love peace", "w1afa7IBcb4": "[Music] my name is Liz and oh I just hit nine thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make and I will try to get through them as we go so as I said lots to look forward to in the future if you're new to my channel I do hope you subscribe and if you enjoy this I really do hope you share with your friends so thanks again for joining and you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "lZVirid-jL0": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and this is a drop roller a machine that makes drops that was made in 1871 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania we're gonna use this machine today to make some hard candy and the hard candy is a bit of an experiment in color and flavor this is about the fourth batch of the day and this is what I like to make experimental candy because the machine while it's a little stained with food coloring from the previous batches is also just right for making candy easily there is an old saying that you taste food with your eyes long before you taste it with your mouth the sight of a food or a color triggers a response which brings on the flavor and leads you to expectations and this video is about those expectations and expectations also take place culturally as we've discussed in other videos the United States sees purple as the flavor of the grape specifically the concord grape and europe sees the purple flavor and candy as the flavor for black currant so now that my hot sugars are 310 degrees i pour it out on my candy cooling table and I ask what flavor is this I mean it's not clear it could be anything and that's what this video is kind of about wondering what the visuals which you can see on the other side of the internet are and how they compare to the flavors which are on my side of the video camera these associations are well known by the people who make food and prepare food for you walk down the aisles of any supermarket and you will see the tomato sauce mostly in red and something that has blueberry in it will have a splash of blue the color is there to key you to what you can't see and can't taste outside the packaging and you are tasting with your eyes and this is okay it's because it's the way we were programmed if you think about it we must have developed food skills before we even developed language skills as a people because if you didn't know when the food was ripe or when it was dangerous to eat you wouldn't be able to you know process the nutrients you made so when something feels soft and even versus lumpy or picky when something smells nice or something looks nice you have expectations and the expectations are programmed into us earlier this year with a laundry detergent tablet we can see these expectations going the wrong way and I think this is a video about breaking those expectations let me give you an example there's something called the strip effect you see you can't taste or smell the candy across the internet but you can see colors and words just fine so let's have some fun with them and then try to apply that to candy so let me demonstrate how you're programmed with colors now I'm going to display some colors on the screen and as I display them save the color out loud for instance we're starting with orange will then do red green yellow blue pink red orange and you'll see the speed is pretty consistent when you do this remember we're saying the colors we don't really care about the words but here the words and the colors will match I want you to read these out loud left-to-right the colors that these words are we'll get back to the Stroop effect in a few moments but we're gonna go play with the hot sugar now and it's cooled off to a great consistency it's sort of the consistency of silly putty or playdough we're gonna put it through these brass rollers that'll cool it off a little bit and make it keep its shape if you'll notice we're making lots of drop rolled round candy here and an opaque red and that opaque red is gonna be important in a moment so now to get at what I'm demonstrating when I show you this next card read out loud the colors not the words but the colors and see if the delay is a little longer than last time [Music] if you did this experiment correctly and just read the colors you'll find the delay going on between when you see it and when you can say it because your body's trying to say or your brain is trying to say the word that's printed not the color of the word and flavors are like this too if you try a flavor that is red and it's colored blue unless you've been trained to recognize that like we have with blue raspberry you're not gonna end up saying or tasting in this case the flavor and that's what our experiment today is we're making drops in bunches of flavors but they're all gonna be the same color and one of the meeting I told everybody what we're gonna do they looked at me and almost as once they said that's madness and I realized our flavor assortment now had a name and madness it is and we're going to pack these candies randomly mix together so you should get some of all the flavors but what flavors some of them are going to be normal do you expect black berry in pink or would you expect an apple in pink we might have butter we're looking at doing a salty flavor and a hot flavor with chili pepper in it and other flavors with this and the fun part is we're gonna be replacing flavors as we run out so we're never quite gonna know what's in the assortment but there's always gonna be six or seven flavors I'm gonna aim for a salty and a sweetness sour and some other things in here and you're gonna have to guess the flavors it's an assortment of fun and love it's sort of combining spin the bottle and Russian Roulette and will give you hints online as we put them up so pay attention when you order but they're gonna change and we're gonna throw some wild cards into because you know April first is coming up and we're gonna have some fun with this candy thanks for watching our video if you liked it you can subscribe to us here on YouTube we have a lot more candy making videos

candies these are old fashioned candies I had the cherry the watermelon root beer and women these were a dollar nine one well the cherry was a dollar a game okay with the watermelon for some reason is marks $0.99 I don't know why they per I just put the wrong time on it but we found them at Tuesday morning they are actually made in Mexico so they probably make other varieties other flavors and but these are the only four that we saw is change their mind okay so these are cherry flavored they 5 pieces are 60 calories and there's 8 servings in here they're probably all the same calories with the wrinkle smaller so there should be 40 pieces 5 times 8 is 40 60 66 again all the time archaeology look like traditional card game yes yeah they have like like powder on mm-hmm might be able to chew these maybe I don't know Dupre home so once you get that sugar off it's um put it like red I like the flavors cherry but it's not strong tourism no strong as I was hoping from the smell it reminds me the cherry and a cough drop without that menthol flavour behind it but it's not as strong as like a lifesaver nowhere near as long ago no actually I'm not you're not mm-hmm well I like it together mm-hmm it's a good piece of hard game to suck on if you're taking a wall piece of piece of the game your mouth and take your walk or whatever mm-hmm I think I'd be good yeah I know just know if you do want to chew it you can because it is her opinion it is not a right now okay so this is watermelon I was expecting it to be brain I think that he's a little writing is green hmm this is same colors as far as the cherry it's a little while the cherries were red that one's pink no cloves that's a little stronger not as strong as the let's see how no way I like that better than the cherry tickets it has a stronger poison that is very very good well i won't i won't you that one but that is so good okay the next one is a root beer it's not wonderful these are you getting stuck on during a meeting - oh yeah laughing is there meaning some but whoever is next he gets the her though the only thing so you'll only have to stick it on your tongue or into the side of your cheek or something or between your tongue and the roof of your mouth right in the middle that's goes when you're stuck on you come up yeah clackety-clack and nobody wants to hear that it's good not good I love that if you like the root beer barrels you would like that it's bracelets I don't know that that's any lighter notes whistles oh yeah sometimes the root beer barrels if you eat a bunch of them they start perfect them out um because well I think any of these if you ate a lot of them just from having that one in the roof of my mouth for a little bit it's like glass or something I mean it's it's so really no yeah oh wow okay this could go either way this could be either cleaner motor cleaner are fresh honestly it's not that strong no it's not like a lemon head or anything it smells stronger than what it actually does labor but I like it mm-hmm hey don't do that Toby I'm wondering why you would choose of course why would you choose any of these fibrous tissues like on I'm wondering but root beer would actually smoke that on your breath watermelon smell beer on your breath with lumens is it no no I don't these eases breath nuts these are just some does occupy your mouth yeah you're sitting bored I'm wondering if you if your throat with scratchy or some you know I don't want no um no just for flavor these are the alternative to smoking when you're bored and you're sitting something forever yeah then you eat really good oh they say if you're trying to quit smoking you should do something to keep your mouth busy right chew gum that's not what people say when they quit smoking they're they're afraid they're gonna gain weight yeah but I always shoot like gum ya know for fun - although but these are these are what I consider meeting candies I take a couple of these for meetings and lured stuck on during the meeting just to have something to do I wonder if they have like a licorice I bet like an annus maybe or what's the settlement you know they have cinnamon or like a spear man or wintergreen or pepper man no there's a buzz of horking I don't know I usually have that horehound yeah around here they do now I don't know if they have for him everywhere right these are going to Mexico so I don't know if it's www.qcnet.com what skip the cherry which is surprising that I'm for me that I'm saying that because normally I would choose a cherry I like cherry quite a bit but it's this particular cherry that I just would leave it which which one did would you leave which one but I don't care about any lemon could lettuce don't like people in them in which one is your favorite ooh between root beer watermelon those are my two favorites - I think root beers my very thick root beer is good I think it would get old after a while five more to hit or change it between both back and forth kind of the raising them yeah whatever the joy in that oh yeah hey everything I'm orange to give me or maybe lime or Apple through definitely yeah the thing is you can buy the same hard candies are like Walmart for like a dog yeah so these are about the same better woman just now if you're in Tuesday morning in your savings yeah they're very thick yeah they're nice and the actual like the shapes things better than like the barrels cuz the barrels do have some new sharp edges these are my some round piece of cake no Baker a nerd those root beer barrels are bigger than that oh yeah we're bigger I'll put you a meter vision no root beer barrels are bigger than these and you're right they because they're barrel shape which is cool but they do have sharp edges yeah I've ever driven yeah so I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end of one code and one uncounted CEOs the other look and thanks for watching [Music]", "4PhUEFnvfLc": "hello everyone it's the trash man hopefully I don't get interrupted again because I've already tried to make this three times ready and I keep getting interrupted we are trying some candy today we have three different flavors because you know I like to try three different things we are trying clays candies since 1919 we got a bunch of different flavors here we have ends eye or however you say that n sigh or something like that we have root beer then we have watermelon okay so let's see if we can get it this time before we get interrupted again these little candies right here I don't know if you guys can see like the little sugar coating so apparently that was picking the 1919 I don't really know this one's not that bad I've tried them yesterday when I got him so I wanted to make sure that was interested in them before or trade them this one kind of has like a black licorice sort of deal and that's kind of weird because they they have a black licorice one and also kind of has like uh like a clove sort of flavor to but it definitely you can definitely taste like a licorice eat thing going on there so it's not bad but it's like a subtle black licorice sort of deal I could only imagine on the black licorice so I'm gonna stay away from that one I like black licorice but I mean this is as far as I'll go because this is just it's perfect so oh yeah you getting that crunch it's really good candy I wasn't a big fan of this one yesterday but yesterday I would have given her about a three I'm gonna give it about a seven this time it's sat in the car overnight so it's not bad so next one we're gonna try is the root beer flavored one oh no I'm just making a taste testing video so no I got old fashioned candies hmm well that's probably from Kelly's vape juice so this one is the work beer that's more of a brownish flavor color the inside was more of a reddish color and it still has like that we can see all the sugar hmm hmm I really can't taste the Ripper in this one now because I had this one first okay yeah I can get the Ripper flavor now it's it's good it almost sounds like wow that's good I almost feels like an A&W sort of deal but then there's like a different sort of root beer kick when you chew on it and bite into it it's got like almost like an rub grippier overload I could taste like three different root beers in here and definitely anw I would have to say mug would be another one that's a really good prepare if you guys haven't had that and another root beer not a lot of people have heard of its called barks root beer yeah this one this is giving me in my top Ted and there's plenty more of these so I will be buying more tomorrow and we will have another video tomorrow as well so now we're going to go for a watermelon water now you can see this isn't what they look like this one's just broken it's got the sugar coating again I'm guessing all of these are going to have like the sugar coating I guess it's something that they did back in the day but I wouldn't be surprised if this watermelon ones a new flavor because I highly doubt they had watermelon flavor in 1919 but you never know these are all artificially flavored unfortunately these are fat free and gluten free and it says now you can enjoy that old fashioned watermelon flavor and a delicious hard candy try some today I'm sure it says that on you know a phone you know it says the same thing except for whatever flavor it is no where's this watermelon one and it's good my only complaint though is watermelon it's supposed to be like a sweetie the sweet watermelon this is more like a tart like it's really tart so that would be my complaint because when I have watermelon a lot of people put salt on it I guess it's like a southern thing I'm not from the South I'm from was gone so I put sugar on my watermelon like you're supposed to [ __ ] that all salt crap that's Nancy yeah that's my only complaint with that is its part with the watermelon flavors there because I don't know if you guys have noticed this like if you guys ever eat like watermelon candies not all them taste like watermelon sorry I don't know if you heard that but I kind of hid it got like a sour punch - not all watermelon candies taste like watermelon unfortunately well that's my review I'm gonna have to give the watermelon I gotta give it an 8 so it's still still up there but my favorite my my winner today is

"WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "s6wv6AtOTbo": "Hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida Greg is doing the narration and Jake is doing the subtitles. The candy I'm going to be making today is  sugar free Sour cherry. As I pour the hot candy onto the table let me tell you how unbelievably hot it is. This is hotter than sugar by 25 degrees F (4C). It does not seem like a lot , but ti is. \n The candy is been flavored with a natural cherry oil. Unlike most cherry candy, this does not taste like cough syrup. Also it is a great flavor for masking the flavor of the sugar free part of  the candy. I thought there would be two parts of The flavor to cover.The front of mouth taste, and that I covered with the cherry oil Then the back of mount flavor I thought I could cover mostly with a good sour. To do that I added this citric acid. It's trickier to add acid to isomalt because everything is hotter. And this citric acid while harder to add  gives this candy a crisp sour tart flavor just like you'd\nexpect from a sour cherry. Sour Cherry isan American tradition it's the most common cherry here in North America and it's known for being made into\ncherry pies and things like that but its history is ancient it was first discovered by Roman soldiers when they were on duty near the Black Sea. They  found this cherry\ngrowing in towns along the Black Sea and they brought it back\nto Rome and eventually the cherry was called the Montmorency cherry. It was  named\nafter a region of France even though it didn't come from that region in France. It was just the flavor I was going for and I'm happy how it came out. This candy is sugar-free, and as such it's not made of sugar it's\nmade of isomalt. Isomalt is a substitute a type of sugar alcohol and is a sugar substitue used primarily for its sugar like properties it has little or no impact on\nblood sugar levels and it does not stimulate the release of insulin so\npeople who aren't supposed to eat high levels of sugar this candy is good for\nisomalt is also about 1/2 the sweetness of sugar so to tweak the sweetness up a\nbit to match what we expect a hard candy to taste like we had a little bit of\nsucralose and we don't need to add much sucralose because sucralose is between\n300 and 1000 times as sweet as sugar. Since I only needed a tiny amount I used a very accurate scientific scale to get the proportions rights. So we build on the sweetness of the isomalt with the sucralose and we count on the isomalt to behave like what you expect hard candy to behave like. Neither of these mate rials promote tooth decay or effects insulin levels. I heard from so many of you that you wanted to try our candy by could not. iI's a little different to work\nwith than regular sugar it's a lot hotter when I pour it and it also sort\nof behaves more like plastic than clay so I have to get the temperature just\nright now that it's adjusted we're gonna cut off pieces and we're gonna feed it\nthrough our drop roller this little machine was made in the late 1870s and\nthis particular machine was owned by the A Cincinnati candy company. Greg\nwas able to acquire this piece of equipment because of a Kickstarter\ncampaign we did and you our fans allowed us to get it.  I want to thank all of you\nfor the support you've given us over the years this has been an amazing to get to do what we love, and have a lot of fun. All this equipment is on display and our store and is used in our store in almost a daily basis if you ever make it to tell a see Florida\nplease come on by we're located right off i-10 on the Thomasville Road exit\nand you can come and see us we open at 7:00 a.m. when we start serving\nbreakfast and we start serving ice cream at about noon and we go til 10:00 p.m.\nmost nights so you can come in we're usually open we're not making candy all\nthe time but sometimes we are and we love it when fans can catch us and can\nsee us make candy now all that's left to do is to split up\nthese sheets of candy into individual pieces and we do that by making the\ncandy live up to its name what's its name you ask fruit drops and that's what\nwe're gonna do you know it's more fun than popping bubble wrap if you want to\ntry this candy for yourself just go over to our website www.PD.net thank you very much for watching and\nthank you for letting us do what we love to do because you know

tick tock diy or die over at tick-tock and i've been making waves baby my latest video which i posted yesterday has 52 000 views check this out there's literally a whole pack of cigarettes in just the little puff bar it's actually kind of a false equivalency but let's just entertain this idea um you're actually it's actually a good thing because you're getting this level of nicotine which is not the bad part of cigarettes or vapor products the bad part is with cigarettes you get all that combustion all that burning all those carcinogens that come from burning tobacco the tar that comes with it that's what's bad and with vapor products you don't get any of that and with high nicotine vapor products you're actually using them a lot less than a lower nicotine product so you're inhaling less pg less vg less flavorings which are not even really shown to be that detrimental but those are the more harmful aspects of vapor products so there you go all right and uh i'm i'm combating all the misinformation that's going on on tic tac i've had enough of all of the misinformation that's going on around about vaping specifically on tick tock so i took it upon myself to start correcting all these [ __ ] so head over to tiktok give me a follow and also let me know if there are any like vaping tick tock videos that you think are stupid or egregious let me know i will respond back and i'm just taking down anyone who's you know who's just lying about vaping these days that's my goal here um and honestly i didn't expect for this to really start like making you know views and stuff but it seems like uh it seems like it is so you know it looks like the people want to know more about vaping and the truth around vaping and i'm going to give it to them so diy or die over on tiktok and of course my instagram uh diy or die over on instagram i'm gonna start posting the same sort of stuff up here um you know they do have like a tick tock competitor on instagram so the same goes for instagrammer right all right everyone thank you all happy acs happy saint patty's day is that true is it saint patty's day is that actually true god damn leprechauns and four-leaf clue what is saint patty's day you know i never really understood what it was nor what it aims to accomplish hold on let's google this what is saint patrick's day so it is st patrick's day it's not saint patty's day uh st patrick uh st patrick's day or the feast of the saints or the feast of st patrick is a culture and religious celebration held on march 17th okay um interesting what's going on here so how did we get to this how did we get to this being about st pat like isn't it weird how we take these holidays or like these traditions and we just [ __ ] destroy them like what does it have to do with saint patrick's you know the leprechaun hats and the green and the [ __ ] beer drinking and i i don't know i know nothing about irish culture or st patrick's or catholic culture for that matter i know nothing about anything um okay well go drink some shamrock shakes go eat some green eggs and ham i don't know what you guys do on st patrick's day other than drink i know that a lot of people like drinking on st patrick's day stay off the road that's for sure don't be driving around on st paddy's day okay all right so we have three recipes here on the docket today first one by npa homemade banana milkshake utilizing flavor art fresh cream flavor art milk creamy vanilla by mullenberry and soft banana by mullenberry simple easy easy to understand i'm excited to try it npa has this is his second time his or her i don't know if it's a he or she second time on the show um so we're gonna check it out looks like it's doing good morn sea is here with cherry sprite using interwear cherries cherry extract fizzy sherbet capellas lemon lime polar blast and ws23 and then a new victim pro b420 with dolce de cheesecake cheesecake graham cross doji de leche graham cracker new york cheesecake and some sweetener i'm excited these are all very sort of simple easy to understand recipes they all look pretty decent i don't see anything wrong with them uh just from a glance so uh a nice easy understandable show here and um i'm gonna give out as many helpful tips and tricks as i can okay i'm gonna do my best on that matter all right cool dudes now i got in something i ordered my nicotine fridge okay so i'm going to show you guys what i ordered i didn't get this in yet i'm it should be here any any minute uh wine fridge i guess no no no wine no this is the one here so i ordered this okay i put an order in for this it should be here in the next uh few hours maybe the schmeck 12 bottle compressor wine cooler refrigerator with lock large freestanding wine cellar 41 degrees to 64 degrees fahrenheit digital temperature control wine fridge for red white champagne or sparkling wine now you might be like why would wayne buy a wine fridge wouldn't you rather buy a freezer not necessarily not necessarily kind of but not necessarily so the reason i went with this instead of like a freezer or a chest for one this is just nicer looking right you can lock it up you don't have to worry about anyone getting in there if they don't have the key to it you could do that with a chest of course but this is like a nice freestanding one but it's just cheap it's 200 bucks it ships to you in a couple days and it's got temperature stability i i will let you know how stable the temperature actually is with this you know i'm not exactly sure that that will be found out but if this is one of the selling points that's why so when we look at what carolina extract says over on their nicotine website okay when we go to their faq which is uh i don't know where how to find it let's see here let me see if i can find it carolina f extract q freezer maybe google that faq okay here it is all right so when we go to carolina extracts faq on their website they state here okay should i store nicotine products in the freezer and then it says if you know that your freezer will maintain temperature below 30 degrees fahrenheit or negative 1 degrees celsius then yes otherwise no damage can occur to 100 milligram per milliliter nicotine products when oxidized when oxides form during near freeze thaw cycles caused by a temperature caused by temperature fluctuations of some freezer units but not all such fluctuations are typically caused by opening the freezer door and outside weather affecting the efficiency of the unit typical refrigeration temperatures or even room temperatures are a much safer storage range because they are well away from freeze thaw potential so this is really where you kind of want to pay attention is with that freeze thaw i guess area because that can introduce oxides when that happens now if you can maintain most freezers should be able to maintain a freezing temperature but if you don't know that for certain then it's a good idea to maybe find a chest or a wine fridge that can do that where it can just maintain a temperature so that's what i'm planning on doing um i planned on i planned on this product here this is exactly what i what i want to do so i ordered a bunch more nicotine so i can fill this thing up and i also ordered here some little uh i believe these are two ounces i ordered a couple two ounces that i'm going to fill up and they're also going to go in there and i got in the art spray so now we're going to be able to once i get my my new nicotine batch because my other nicotine it it's crazy this feels like it's empty it feels like they sold me an empty bottle but um it comes with a nice little cork let's see if the cork fits on these i don't think they will huh nah uh polycone lids but once the other batch of nicotine comes to me i'm gonna break them down into these bottles okay so i'm gonna get the nicotine i'm gonna fill this up and then i'm gonna screw it down chuck that in the fridge and i'm not touching it ever until i need to touch it do you understand so each of these filled with 100 milligrams per milliliter i'm stuck baby i'm good to go are you good to go that's the question right are you good to go me and my family and all my friends who vape don't ever have to worry about nicotine ever again okay so that's kind of the point that i wanted to to get no i shouldn't have crushed this because i kind of want to store this uh we don't have to worry about it right this is the this is where you might want to position yourself so you just don't have to worry about it can you get in the future can you not get in the future can you get it shipped can you get it black market can can companies from china send it over and call it massage oils nothing like that is known right now it's just a wait and see game so if you have the funds it doesn't hurt to be prepared if you don't have the funds i i i feel bad for you honestly i feel bad for you it sucks but welcome to america where the politicians decide on things without any input from you know the constituents okay so once i get the fridge in we'll do a little video on like nice proper storage so would i love it if this could be a sub you know refrigerator or temperature refrigerator sure i would but um this was 200 bucks and it was shipped and i rather kind of do it this way it's the the cheapest easiest way to show all of you guys how i'm doing it just so we can maintain you know the cheapest way possible and just know that it will work okay so that's what's going on here um and you can see all here here are the other specs which you know it all of this stuff rewind goes for nicotine as well temperature stability it's uv resistant so any sort of light that shines on it you don't have to worry about it it's going to go through the you know the stained glass the uv light is not going to go through the stained glass nor is it gonna go through the stained glass and then through the amber bottle so you don't have to worry about that uh it's got like a nice look to it you can lock it up so no kids can get into there if you have children um and yeah and honestly the best sort of way maybe i'll do this in the future is put some sort of like battery system so this would instead of plugging straight into the wall would plug into like a battery generator and then have that generator plugged into the wall just in case if power goes out it doesn't sort of affect the temperature it just keeps it running you know what i mean um that's a little bit paranoid thinking but it is the best way to do it and if you are spending like a thousand dollars on nicotine maybe it is a good idea to go that route you know it's really up to you on uh how crazy you want to take it so there we go there we go that's my uh my uh vape apocalypse um what is it called uh what are those people prepping system that's my prep there's my my bunker my nicotine bunker if you will um and yeah i'll be making videos about all of this once it all gets here should be here today i got everything else i just need that stuff i need that stuff all right what's going on everyone you guys have any questions comments anything you want to ask before we start getting into some mixing here um chasing classes don't want to be a bummer but can my dad get some prayers we just found out he has a lymphoma cancer oh man uh sad to hear man sad to hear prayers shout out to some prayers to chasing clouds hopefully your dad can overcome it i know nothing about that does it have anything to do with your lymph nodes is that why it's called lymphoma i don't know sorry to hear man stay strong you should do a video on storing your nicotine with that gas stuff yeah we will be for sure i have a huge bottle of 100 stored under argon from years ago yeah we're definitely gonna do that and i'll let you know if one bottle is enough to fill i don't know how many 120s or or two ounces two ounces 120 right i bought a few liters of nick so hopefully it will get me by for a while yeah a few liters is is a lot a few liters is a lot you know um you know it kind of sucks for uh for those who aren't in the know right if you aren't watching this channel if you aren't you know in vaping it's hard to know about all of this stuff it really sucks how are you like how how are you going to get by are you going to go back to smoking seems like that's what the government wants you to do i did not get the vso apple and that's why you're not on today sorry buddy i had my weightless arg good deal had my weightless argon cannon bottles arrived last week now a little over two liters of nick to store wait have you got your one shots figured out for shipping well as far as i can tell they should ship just fine they should just ship just fine uh we'll see what's going on with liquid barn but the ones over at flavor jungle there's we have no issues with them it's not a nicotine product it's not a vaping product it's a flavor product from a flavoring company you know what i'm saying should ship just fine now with liquid barn things might get a little interesting we're going to see kind of where they're taking it are they going to continue being a nicotine company are they going to become a flavoring company are they going to separate the departments you know is liquibar nick a different department from liquid barn flavor we'll see uh we've talked about it a little bit but there are no concrete answers it's kind of a wait-and-see game for all of the nicotine companies nicotine river included stuff like that we kind of just need to see where the where the chips lay um but in terms of just the just the flavorings over at flavor jungle they're they're not vapor products and they're not vaping pro they're not vaping products and they're not nicotine products they're not tobacco products so don't have to worry about that now if the government says like i told you guys if the government says you can't ship flavorings anymore then where i'm out of here i'm not a us citizen anymore and i and i hope it really comes across as like i'm not kidding about that if the government tells you you can't buy flavorings or ship flavorings you now live in a communist country and i don't care what anyone says about that it's it that's out of the question so if we get to that point you'll know because i won't be here anymore we'll be streaming out of some i don't know shed in the uk or something but we're not there just yet technically we kind of are but we're not there just yet hello wayne i'm a canadian communist thanks for that bc has zero issues with nicotine and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year this bc has issues with zero nick and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year um do you mean like you can't they won't allow you to ship flavorings at all is that what you're trying to say i've been canada been bugging fusion flavors to bug you they carry your stuff but barely um yeah tell them to contact me for sure for sure they can pick up some stuff canada is on its way there uh health canada soon will be releasing a canada gazette to propose a federal flavor ban we now have credible information indicating that we may see the release of the gazette part one as early as may uh in my country politicians are surely waiting for what else to do in the u.s politicians are so useless that they don't even think for themselves but you know the third world country what country are you talking about bobby told me they were going to be just flavors when you say you're talking about liquid barn are you talking about liquid barn two ounces is six milliliters right so four ounces those are four ounce bottles thank you for that four ounces is 120 correct um canada's on its way there especially notice grocery restrictions here are [ __ ] so when you say like you can't ship flavorings like that's my question just flavorings from a flairing company not a vaping company that's my question if that happens i mean let me let me put it this way if the u.s says you can't ship flavorings or any anywhere that i live says you can't ship flavorings i'm not doing this whole thing anymore i'm i'm becoming an advocate or an activist against the government because there's no point in living in a country where they're restricting your access to flavor for no reason and i hope that makes sense like i hope the severity of that makes sense like it's not a joke imagine if the government for no reason for there's no benefit to it they're just doing it because they don't actually know the industry imagine the industry said you can't ship certain colors anymore you can't buy certain colors of paint because a kid might use them to draw a red swastika so you can't buy certain colors of paint everyone would go [ __ ] insane and you would be like this is crazy we're living in a crazy country right now living in a dictatorship you could do that for sounds right you can't make music with certain sounds you can't ship certain instruments because they make certain sounds because a kid might use it to make a sound of i don't know sex noises or whatever they would deem is bad right you'd be like what the [ __ ] is going that's this that's the same level of what's going on with flavorings if they do that with flavorings it's a bad we're in a bad we're no longer having fun vaping we are now revolting against the government a tyrannical government you know i like i might even consider like suing like i would might even consider suing taking it trying to take it to like the supreme [ __ ] chord on that it's [ __ ] outrageous it's outrageous maybe i don't know maybe no one else thinks of it that way maybe i'm the only one that thinks of it that way i see when i bring this up to people when we talk about flavor bands they kind of go oh yeah i guess that is kind of crazy like they don't think of like wait a second they're restricting access to to flavor let alone just vaping it just the the just the access to it alone you know we sell flavorings at our shop to mix with unflavored base marketed as water concentrates boss was saying they might change to a diy soap supply shop to get around the vape tax on the vgpg nick yeah okay well we'll see if that works uh now i understand not saying i agree with it but i understand a company saying if you ship this vape product with nicotine along with this flavoring product then of course you know can't do that you can't just you can't do that but in terms of like look this is a multi-purpose flavoring it's just a flavoring you can't ship it bad news bad [ __ ] news because there's no precedence for that there's no precedence for that they're limiting your access to a specific sense that's 1984 bad we're we're not having fun anymore this is not a joke anymore we're we're now living in a dictatorship if your country already does that they get the [ __ ] i mean you gotta do something because i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you you're living in a you lit you're living in a prison you're not living in a country you're not living in a state you're living somewhere like a prison i feel the same way unjust laws need to be challenged on an individual level yeah that would be that would be where i would draw the line and say okay it's time to it's time to really fight for your rights you know what i mean now how to go about that i don't know i don't know the logistics of that i would happily figure out a way though i would dedicate my entire life to it or i would just move i mean that's the easiest thing i would just move to a different country that didn't have a dictatorship essentially but i have the means to do that not everyone has the means to do that you might just be screwed you just can't know what strawberry flavor tastes like um okay the supreme court won't do its job i have a lot of faith in the supreme court to be honest it's not a perfect system for sure but i do have faith in its uh i'm not that i'm not i'm not that i'm not uh i have more worry about like lower courts and how lower courts would rule on something like that than the supreme court sort of ruling on supreme court usually gets things pretty right maybe after some time but for the most part i have more faith in that than anything else in the justice system come to the uk wayne you know every day that goes by i think more and more about that for sure every day that goes by all right just order 2 liters cnt and watermelon hell yeah baby cesaro round of applause four boxes of samoas and some other ones are my brother all i care about are the most samoans right isn't that how you say sumo wins all right you need to live in a state where a governor tells the feds to stuff it yeah true that is true i don't have faith in governors though i mean pa is not too bad but we'll see you know when the when [ __ ] starts to hit the fan we'll see if they really care you say no samoas yeah but is it aren't multiple samoas samoans i don't know what i'm talking about florida should i come to florida it's too hot i lived in florida for a year i did enjoy my time in florida do you remember when that guy ate that dude's face on the uh highway uh that guy ate he was on basalt and ate that dude's face i lived right there that's where i lived in lantana florida right next to palm beach i did enjoy it florida was pretty cool but i don't know if i could live live live there it's a little wild all right well let's start mixing while we keep talking about florida and eating faces all right let's do the banan let's do the dolce de leche cheesecake first here it's from a new victim pro b420 okay looks good to me i

how new new york is a beautiful state if you guys have never been to new york it's got great hiking it's got great like seasonal weather like if you like the seasons um you know upstate new york gets pretty cold but overall it's like a it's a great state that's just completely destroyed i hate to break it to you but like the constituents you know a lot of the people that live in new york just vote against their ins their their interests maybe it's new york city that does it um but for the most part it's like you know the governor's there the law is there it's such a nanny state it's a shame really you know pa is kind of a lot like new york except just a little i would say like a little bit more southern in its law making and it's uh you know it's a little bit redder of a state which is kind of what you want you want a more balanced approach to your legislatures and your laws in your state you know you don't want to you don't want you don't want either too far right or too far left it's policies you kind of want to smack in the middle there seems to be this anti-centrist movement going on also which i don't understand so he's using tfa sweetener i'm just gonna go a half a percent of super sweet normally i would do exactly the type of sweetener you tell me but here i just don't feel like digging it out i don't really use tfa sweeter i don't recommend tfa sweetener uh where's my base where did i put my piece what the [ __ ] yeah this cnt stuff has been uh sitting room temperature opened uh almost i mean pretty much daily i open and close this bottle you know multiple times a day and it's still spot on and i've had that for a few months now maybe maybe a year now maybe over a year it's still good like this stuff lasts pretty good if you just make sure you're closing it you're storing it away from any sort of light or heat don't have to worry too much about temperature i believe states need to have an electoral college most big cities rule the rest of the state yeah for sure for sure you know at least here in pa you know the laws that philadelphia imposes don't necessarily attract with the rest of the laws the state imposes you know you do have some sort of municipality separation but i don't know how that goes for other states and other cities like you can see like at least in the case of new york new york city definitely influences a lot of the rest of the state but i don't know like the ins and outs of new york law so don't quote me on that they said the city smell bad new york city come to philly it's all fake news it's phony stuff it didn't happen you're not alone on steeping sure i mag stir for a bit but after that i never see a difference in stuffing a bottle away for 50 years i believe uh all right i read that one all right dolce the cheesecake here here we go dolce de no that's not correct milk is leche dulce dulce dulce a sweet food or drinks it just means sweet what does it mean sweet sweet cheesecake does it mean like caramel or something i don't know it's got a good smell to it it definitely smells cheese cakey which is not you know not a obviously a bad thing it is sweet let's give it a rip not a lot of depth from the hand test pretty good not too bad i can see why you want to steep it for two weeks steeping would actually help in this situation i'm not gonna lie sleeping would help a little bit here um all right let's get to some points here your cheesecake is a a little coconutty and that's really just a product of the cheesecake that you're using the tfa cheesecake and new york cheesecake it's a little coconutty like you get a little bit of that coconut note i don't think it works very well in cheesecake it's hard to get around because it's so prominent in tfa cheesecake steeping does help that and that's why i really think you know this would benefit from a steep it doesn't get rid of it but it helps it a little bit four percent and then you have three and a half of cheesecake two i use cheesecake one i don't have cheesecake too they're not very different um and the dolce de leche gives it a kind of like a nice sort of nuttiness it gives a little bit of depth but that's kind of where i think this is really lacking the depth of the flavor we're not talking about volume here we're not talking about um you know uh width we're not talking about like uh flavor stage or anything like that just simple depth of flavor i pick up cheesecake pick up a little dairy and then i pick up like a touch of nuttiness sweetness and that's really it there's really not much to it i'm not really getting a big graham cracker note maybe a touch of it maybe a touch of it but i would like to see that improved in some way um tfa graham cracker might not be your best answer for that it seems to only accentuate the coconut note but it's not bad and i think you have a pretty good base here if you just continue working on it i think you can have something really good my tips would be figure out a way [Music] to um [Music] figure out a way to get your cheesecake a little bit more cheesy but i don't mean that in the way of like a yogurty cheese i mean it more in the way of like almost like texture try to get some sort of fluffiness going on here because that's really just going to kind of broaden your flavor stage a little bit and then maybe you can add a little bit more accent to the to your recipe to give it a little bit more depth so whether it's a little bit of caramel butterscotch um maybe it's another vanilla maybe you go brighter and you go with another vanilla it also help kind of separate out your graham cracker it's just not too much here to really get excited about you know what i mean like it tastes fine but it's not a very exciting mix which i'm assuming why you sent it in you want tips to how do i make this better how do i get this to that next level right white sweetener instead of tfa sure yeah flavor west sweetener at like .25.5 um tfa is not the best sweetener to use but that's not really the issue i don't think it's more so just the flavor really am i roboting oh no [Music] what the [ __ ] man are you kidding this is getting annoying if i'm robotic i have to literally reset my computer it stopped if it robots again it's gonna do it again i feel like aaron bieber [ __ ] man it's just so annoying it's been doing it the whole time on and off uh we'll just have to be quick then we'll just be quick [ __ ] no it's windows windows [ __ ] sucks some driver's messed up and when my computer goes to sleep and i don't reset it my drivers get roboty sometimes all right look we're just gonna have to be quick i apologize all right um i just have to remember to restart or just not use windows anymore um okay so going back to this going back to this not a very exciting recipe just off your score we're gonna give you a two and a half this is very average i think of being uh a little bit generous here with the two and a half out of five you caught me on a good day i kind of want to give it a 2 2.25 um i want to see more from it is really what i want to see i want to see i want to see this added with some added depth so try to figure out maybe accentuate some of the nuttiness that's going on with your recipe maybe try to add different accents such as like another caramel um another butterscotch something else you know what i mean throw something else in there like that try to figure out something to really kind of take this to the next level and then try to fluff up your cheesecake a bit you know what i'm saying try to get a little bit more fluffiness going on you could do that with you could try it with yogurts you could try it with like some sort of whipped cream some sort of fresh cream you could try it with different types of creams you could try with a different cheesecake maybe try mullenberry's panna cotta i've been having a lot of fun with that ingredient you could try there's a lot of different ways you can go down that route because what's that going to do it's going to give you a little separation it's going to allow you to infuse another accent or two in there and it's going to just give you a little bit it's going to be a little bit more forgiving um and yeah there's a little bit of like that coconut off note but overall i think it will steep out i don't think it's that much of an issue it's not bad though like i don't want to say it's a bad recipe it's got a good taste good flavor to it it's just not very exciting it's not something that excites there's no excitement to it you know if this was the first ever cheesecake maybe but it's not this is you know the millionth cheesecake here someone says hanks in italian cream yeah yeah you can go like that route you can go the vanilla pudding route you have a good base layer just need to figure out what to do with it okay two and a half out of five well i'll give you the average you're like again you're lucky you cut me on a good day i want to get to give it a two 2.25 but we'll keep it there for now all right let's do the banana milkshake another very simple mix here simple straightforward just how i like it i'm saying let's mix this up here so this includes fresh cream and a half let me adapt this before i make 70 mls of it oh yeah baby okay fresh cream half a percent just a touch just a drop not a lot what's that from is it from art class when you were in school anyone ever say that to you just a drop not a lot one percent creamy vanilla by mullenberry this skill seems better days hey i use my skills i put the work in on these scales all right if you see a clean scale don't trust a mixer with a clean scale that's what i say we got one and a half of flavor arts milk classic flavor art milk dap bonanza and the three percent soft banana by mullenberry which is possibly one of the best banana ingredients you can get very good stuff and a touch of sweet you know i saw a post on reddit that said is sweetener necessary they were talking about hey i see wayne when he mixes he uses a lot of sweetener well he uses sweetener in every recipe basically this is a conversation that comes up a lot but the the the let me put it this way if you are acclimated to commercial e-liquid then it's a good idea to get it it's a good idea to get it and use it at a half a percent super sweet um of course you know sucralose based sweetener but it's really what it does is that it increases it it cuts out a lot of development time it increases your presence of your recipe by like 10 times you know not even like 10 like 10 times increases the presence without having to need to go through that extreme amount of development time to replicate it without sweetener cause like you can do all of this stuff without sweetener it's just gonna take you a really long time to develop it and it's gonna you know you're gonna leave out a lot of profiles that you wouldn't otherwise be able to make as saturated so it's like a cheat code it is like a cheat code it can quickly become a crutch and that's something you have to watch out for but um you know if you want something that's very present very saturated very vivid sweetener just helps you get there without worrying about that extremely long development cycle so like some of my best work has been made without sweeteners it can be done it just you know those recipes took months to make for no real benefit other than like do you want a vape sweetener or not you know do you do you want to inhale sucralose or not that's really the that's really the uh where the contention comes into play so here's the recipe sorry also when you go sweetener it's very difficult to go back that's the other thing too so if you don't if you can vape and you're completely fine without sweetener just know when you start using sweetener it's hard to go back nothing is going to taste as saturated or as potent or i shouldn't say nothing but most recipes aren't because no one really that that mixes without sweetener takes the time to develop as if they're trying to replicate something with sweetener usually a mixer who mixes without sweetener mixes with that like they vape without sweetener they they want it less sweet they want it less present you know what i mean but there are some occasions where you know someone who can post up a recipe and it's vivid and bright and saturated without the sweetener included because they took the time to develop it that way just going back to the nicotine i would freeze the nick i think carolina extracts information is wrong i had in the freezer for five years just what i think i don't know if it's wrong i wouldn't say it's wrong it's just i think it's a i think they're being a little bit more overly cautious is what is how i read it they're basically saying like we don't know what type of freezer you're using if you're in that freeze thaw threshold a lot with your crappy home freezer then you know you could be ruining your product so they just say look there's really no detriment to putting it somewhere that maintains the same temperature obviously you don't want it in a hot environment but they were they were like you know a refrigerator is a better option because you're not getting to that freeze throt freeze thaw area so most freezers i would say probably can maintain a good freeze temperature but it really isn't about that it's really more so just oxygen heat and light you know oxygen heat and light is what's going to degrade your nicotine um not you know keeping it frozen slows that process down but ultimately if any of those attributes were added to the equation it's still going to the grade does that make sense did i say that in a way that made sense all right i use sweeter and all my mixes but i am concerned about diabetes you don't have to be uh i was in contact with someone with diabetes and they were concerned about sweetener and they said not an issue for them yeah so like going back to the nicotine that's why i'm going with this method with the wine refrigerator essentially um i don't have to worry about the freeze thaw cycle at all you know what i mean i could just pop out a bottle of nicotine let it sit and it's not going to go through a defrost it's going to just you know slightly come up to warm temperature which is only 10 20 degrees from whatever temperature i'm going to set it at and it's going to keep just as long you'll see you'll see once we put it in there you can certainly freeze it don't get me wrong you can absolutely freeze it but it does it does bring up more points of failure than not um you know i have multiple bottles that have just been sitting because i don't have room for them in my freezer that have just been sitting in my closet you know all right here we go homemade banana milk i'm very excited for this one i haven't had a banana milkshake flavor in a long long time smells good tastes a little runty on the hand okay not bad it's a little disappointing unfortunately i hate to break it to you let's read your notes here very simple profile it tastes like you put a banana and milk in a blender nothing artificial depending on how green you like your banana you can add some mb soft banana at four percent it's quite green at five percent it's mostly peel interesting testing haku vena okay thank you for your testing notes a round of applause for anyone who has their testing notes of course yeah let's just let let's sit on this person let's sit on this for a second oh slushy critique yes send in you submit your recipes man submit submit i'm roboting this is so annoying i didn't know it started to do it to my microphones okay well someone said robot alrighty then okay okay okay i have i have a few of your recipes slushie well i have like a mint chocolate chip one or something there might be another one too all right this is good this is simple that you you do say you wanted a very simple profile this is simple but it to me i'm going to be a stickler here to me it tastes as if it tastes like you just didn't the simplicity is missed in the profile your your flavorings that are are added are simple but the taste of it in my opinion the execution didn't quite work it's a it to me it tastes more like a banana cream with cream if that makes sense i'm not getting like a banana milkshake you're not really hitting that very simple profile um just because you developed it in a simple way doesn't mean it's a simple flavor right you know what i'm saying there it just kind of comes through like uh um just a bit lacking kind of like the last one a little bit lacking like the idea of simplicity shouldn't be about you making a simple recipe that the flavor itself could be simple you know yeah i apologize we're just gonna have to run through this i i'm gonna i would have to shut the whole [ __ ] thing down and restart we'll just go right through it whatever the last episode doesn't matter it won't happen again i'll just remember to reset every time i go live you do have a good base here the soft banana is a smart move three percent i think it works as well um i would like to see a little bit more of like a natural banana flavor to me there is a little bit of like a banana runt flavor like a candy banana banana cream flavor that could be worked out you know where it could be a little bit more natural maybe include some sort of like baked more baked banana flavor in there and i would really just like to see more of an emphasis on the milkshake part um i think that's where you could really let this recipe shine it just to me it's not shaky enough it's a little bit more like creamy less so milk shaky like i want something to kind of add some again like some sort of volume being included maybe a cheesecake in here for instance that that to really kind of give it some density some weight um maybe some sort of like richer cream you know all the creams that we were talking about in the cheesecake would apply here as well you know try to mess around with that to really see where you think this profile can go to meet that milkshake idea yeah i i i apologize it's pleasant you got a pleasant flavor here for sure it is pleasant i love banana i love but like my my the the flavor that got me into vaping was a banana it was epic vanilla which was a banana vanilla flavor very similar to this so there is some sort of like an underlying bias here yeah i i think we're gonna give you a three out of five a little above average here three out of five a little above average a little above average oh i see that's that explosion is probably louder than this explosion isn't it yeah see i got to change the volume on those things as well three out of five um i'm giving you a little above average mainly because i do think you have a nice sort of base layer going on like you've got a good start here but it's still kind of falling into the same trap as the other one where i just want to see a little bit more depth to it it does you don't have to make it more intricate you don't have to add more notes to it but give me something to hold on to something to bring my interest some sort of intrigue to the recipe whether that's making that milkshake super accurate that's the thing with simple profiles guys when you're doing something simple it doesn't just mean like a sim like they're simple in two ways you can make a simple recipe where it's just a couple ingredients or you can make a simple profile which is what this person which is what mpa is saying here right he wants a simple profile banana milkshake right well that doesn't mean your recipe has to also be simple okay um so like i said give me something to hold on to when you're doing something simple a simple profile you really want to sell it you really want to sell that through so strawberry you're just doing a strawberry make it the best [ __ ] shrubbery you've ever had that's what's really going to bring people to it don't just go okay this is a simple strawberry and it tastes like every other [ __ ] strawberry that we mixed up you know what i mean in this case you're on your way there but it does taste very very sort of like this is a banana cream with another cream added to it and they're not doing anything really new and you're not bringing any interest to the profile and i'm more partial to this because i do love like i said banana flavors so yeah um that's my big critique for you there you need to kind of think about where you want to take it do you want a better banana flavor do you want something to really bring that banana in or do you want to work more on like that milkshake base do you really want to make like a super accurate milkshake to bring people in that way you could try to do both um yeah that's it that's basically it so that there's my big sort of uh there's my big sort of uh lesson for the day simple when you do a simple profile not a simple recipe simple recipe is different a simple profile really try to sell it really really try to sell that thing make it the best blank that you could possibly do because it's only going to really further that idea like wow i love you know i have someone who really loves blueberry flavors like blow their mind right when you're making them a blueberry recipe or you're going down that simple route make it the best make it so vibrant or so accurate or so you know what i mean bring bring something to it bring something to it don't don't just say i'm making a simple blueberry and then you just give me flavor west blueberry because that's like okay well this is simple in the fact that like you didn't really work hard on it you know you mean you didn't really develop it you just said it's as simple because you just used one ingredient that's that that's a simple recipe that's a different story okay there's my big uh lesson for the day and it goes for both of those recipes it goes through both of those recipes the dulce de cheesecake and uh the homemade banana milkshake both are simple but they're like simple in the sense that it's like boring you know you submitted a different recipe all right from russia with love um you can send it to my email if you're not using twitch you could send through discord send it here oh just know that if you send it through twitch you're uh more likely to be on sooner i should say okay yeah we're gonna start opening them up a little bit more as it seems like i have to force you guys to send recipes all right cherry cheesecake i'm sorry cherry sprite cherry cheesecake cherry sprite cherry sprite very nice okay anywhere cherries one and a half i can't afford to pay for sending in recipes you don't have to pay you don't have to pay do you mean like the amount of watch time needed yeah i don't know maybe it's not calculating the points correctly maybe that's what's going on let's see how many points you have type in let me see how many points you have days for glory cherry extract at one and a half oh you have enough points what do you mean fizzy sherbet by vape train two percent so um the way you do it make sure you sign into your twitch name on stream elements so go to that link and make sure you're signed into your twitch name three percent lemon lime and then you do critique recipe which is a thousand points polar blast nws23 okay polar blast nws23 oh actually i don't know if i haven't i don't have any uh i don't have any we're gonna have to pretend like i use some [ __ ] i thought i totally forgot about it well let's see let's if it if if i feel like it's not good then we'll postpone this damn dude i don't have any ws23 i need to go to flavor jungle the lucy mint do i have to watch on twitch to get points yes but you can just submit through email if you want recipe straight from canada all right okay okay if you want seven up verse sprite check out this cherry up very similar to this kind of i'm waiting on a pie crust for your recipe one-on-one pie crust the one that you submitted i don't have any ws anything i have culada that's it it's okay it's whatever there's a little bit of a caveat here you know what's also really nice about soft banana it doesn't stick to your coil like other bananas you can drip on top of it and the banana goes away like like lorenz banana cream some other bananas too like like flavor art banana they do not leave your coil man all right here's cherry sprite by morency morrissey recently picked up a bunch of flavors i was really wanting a good cherry recipe i took the base from iutenti's one two three uh cranberry spring replaced the flavor cranberry with a combination of vinegar cherries and cherry extract didn't really know where to start with them so i kind of guessed this result is my cherry sprite recipe good shaking vape but after a couple days seeping it really shines doesn't have that medicinal cherry taste the cherries are definitely the forefront but the spread is there just enough in the background to give it a subtly uh fizzy lemon lime taste in the excellent i also added some polar blast at 3s23 to give it a chilled cool feel so it seems like the the coolant isn't really uh that necessary to the recipe test it on the citadel thank you for your testing notes 28 dads super fun what's that a bad bad bad that's dad here we go fantastic fantastic fantastic jello see ice that would involve me digging out my delusion i just have no i have no interest in doing so graham is such a delosie shill i need another i need a bigger shelf that's the thing i only bought a six a six six block shelf and i threw away my eight block shelf or no i threw away my uh i have a nine block shelf i threw it with my 16 block shelf which was a bad move the one that i had in my out my old office that might have been a 12 block show nonetheless i'm i'm out of blocks and i need more this tastes excellent this tastes like cherry sprite man this tastes excellent it's definitely um it's definitely like more along the lines of like a um how do you put it the pull the blast works actually really well i really i i really like it i really [ __ ] like it to me it's definitely like it keeps the vibe of sprite more than the cherry like to me like cherry sprite i don't even know if is cherry spread a thing there's a bottle here i don't know if i've ever had it but it definitely has like a sprite like a really good sprite vibe to it with like a nice sort of ride out on cherry i was a little afraid your uh cherry extract wasn't gonna bring much to the table but it seems like it does i don't know if it's really the anywhere cherries that's pulling that along every time i've used cherry extract i've been kind of not impressed by it it's kind of thin and light but i mean i'm getting a really good cherry note here but real i'm really impressed by is like that lime and lemon fizzy sherbet lemon lime and fizzy sugar i mean that's sprite that's [ __ ] sprite it's a very nice sprite flavor this is a fun vape too someone rated you three stars let's see why citadel rda uh one week light cherry comes first then astringent lemon quite thin with the predominance top notes that's interesting um might be good for your mouth something and that's interesting i actually think the opposite i actually think the opposite i think this works really well i think this works really well i don't get an astringent lemon maybe their lemon lime is bad or something or maybe too much fizzy sherbet we're gonna go 4 out of 5. [Applause] [Music] i just see my where i'm talking and then i see the red when i press that button i see the red bar just burn [Laughter] yeah vape train fizzy sherbet it's pretty [ __ ] good with the cap lemon lime really sells the sprite flavor i'm trying to give you some critiques here my critique is that i can't give you too much critiques i didn't do with the ws23 but my critique would be that when i think of like a cherry soda like that cherry is really prominent and like like it's like really a main aspect like it it's really there you know what i mean like the cherry is like all cherry this definitely seems more sprite flavored with like a nice cherry right out i don't know what cherry sprite tastes like but all the other cherry sodas i've had like that cherry is like the main thing and that's not here in this recipe to me the the winner is the sprite base and then you kind of color it in with a little bit of cherry on the finish you definitely get cherry in the top but it's i get that when you when you exhale you get that whole sort of note and that's where it really is nice but i wouldn't call this like a super like cherry recipe it's more like a cherry accent it's good though like that i like that um but that's my critique is if if uh if making this more cherried would make this closer to cherry sprite then maybe work on that maybe try to figure out a way to get a deeper cherry note in there i like wild cherry by mullenberry um who's saying uh rin is saying ssa juicy cherry yeah juicy cherry is great mainly mullenberry cherries are the best ones uh the inner cherries taste great maybe the cherry extract maybe it's not necessary maybe increase anywhere i don't know or maybe maybe i don't know maybe the cherry extract is doing a lot anytime i've used it i've not been impressed by cherry extract okay there is a little soapiness going on there is a touch of medicinal quality or chemical quality and i'm assuming that's from the fizzy sherbet every time i've mixed this up it's kind of had this weird sort of like artificial vitamin note um yeah that's definitely where it's coming from i can just smell it on there maybe that steeps out i'm not sure now it's definitely the fizzy sherbet so maybe try to work out that off note it's slightly there if you know if if you're someone with a less refined palette you might not pick it up sweetener will just cover it up anyway but i can i can pick it up you know that's something to knock points off right there um everything else is pretty good though everything else is pretty [ __ ] good good time to ask sent email chemnivatic fizzy ad or new fizzy ad version two what do you know i know i know about neither i don't know anything about fizzy ad or fizzy ad too i know nothing about them bob says indian mango liquid barns vanilla ice cream and fizzy sherbet amazing recipe just mix it without ws23 as well and it's indeed true to spite sprite beverage i like it and the cherry is there pro probably more cherry would kill the sprite yeah it's good thanks i love when you guys mix with me especially i know screwdriver you've been mixing with me a lot it's great to see when i get some sort of like outside reference to what i'm saying thank you for that um yeah that's the thing right if that's the thing that i mean that's kind of i i haven't tried a cherry sprite so i don't know but i know you know exactly what i'm talking about other cherry sodas the cherry is like such a deep part of the recipe so if you're looking for that then maybe try to figure out a better cherry a better way to add the cherry in here um you probably would kill the sprite but that's really where the the creativity or the you know the crafting would come into play try to how to how to figure out how to work that out and then i do get a touch of like that fizzy sherbet medicinal vitamin note that could be worked out overall though i think it is really nice i think it tastes great now when i look at sam's where is it i don't see it anymore where'd it go oh when i look at sam sent over his cherry sprite which kind of has the same base i can see this being a little bit more of like that deeper cherry flavor just because you're using the red cherry going a little crazy with the moscato and the sour lemon you are using a lemon lime soda instead of capella's lemon lime which might work i mean i don't see why that wouldn't work but you got the inner wear cherries with the fizzy sherbet yeah i'm curious as to i don't know about i don't know about the moscato but it seems like you're not trying to go for cherry spray well you're saying akin to 7up is a pretty finicky ingredient it's very vibrant cherry seven up is delicious cherry on top of the first sip and then it just kind of disappears that's kind of what you get with this recipe it's kind of what you get here the cherry is more of an accent the the sprite base is really where i think it and like with just the polar blast is good you know the ws-23 is just going to add a little bit more fizziness to the mix but just the polar blast works as well it cools it down and it adds a touch of fizz to it for sure that's stripping cherries with lemon lime you already know what it tastes like you already know what it tastes like mostly oh true yeah yeah yeah i forgot about that recipe yeah you could probably go cranberry you can probably go cranberry you could probably go with like a little bit of some sort of like boozy flavor if you wanted to do like a cranberry vodka sort of thing cranberry vodka soda maybe black tea tfa black tea for that vodka note i mean that's it you're the winner here morency is the winner let's give morenzy a round of applause [Applause] am 100 let's see yes he is 3 000. see once you start uh winning then you start to snowball your points you guys can give points to each other's by the way if you want if someone new wants to send the recipe they don't have enough points feel free to give them some points some of you rich [ __ ] this is a community effort all right that's it for the show my dudes and dudettes that's it for the show my dudes and dudettes i'll see you guys on tomorrow for a new video and i will see you guys friday live for live mixing and then i will see you guys next week for all the same stuff baby oh wait we have to do a uh wake up with wayne also what is that when did i plan on doing that now i was thinking saturday but i don't know if i can do saturday you might see a wake up with wayne we're trying out some different times we'll see we'll see where that lands you guys know

coming and the fruit season coming along I wanted to share with you some of my favorite candy when this comes out of the dehydrator is going to be like a cross between taffy and cotton candy this is so delicious now everyone slices about this then watermelon is interesting it has in the seeds a the seeds have a substance that make them kind of a diuretic which means that if you eat the seeds along with the rest of the melon that would keep your body from unnaturally retaining too much water if you get this too thin then it gets to be too hard to get off of the sheets so you want probably those thickness if it gets too thin in it it doesn't dry up as well as it could and it's kind of sticky so you don't want too thick and you don't want it too thin and depending on the type of fruit and how much moisture is in it and the thickness of it the length of time is going to vary here's a thin one that has stuck on to it but even that comes pretty good normally they don't come off that easily I'm going to turn these over see if maybe that'll quicken their drying time now this one is at a really good stage I like the stage that this one is in you can tell that it's drying a little bit leathering this one is still too moist see how it kind of springs back up there's still a lot of wet pockets in there so that's going to need more time this one is still wet inside you can see so I'm going to put them back probably by this evening or maybe tomorrow they should be done this is how they look after about a day and a half of drying there perfect the worst part about them is they don't last very long and are so good it's like caramel candy taffy cotton-candy all mixed together this is some of the best candy you could get ahold of as a whole food tastes great it's going to be hard to save some for John when it gets home from work I can do three very true you you", "bYkei_LyNw4": "you like going to the data store secuno the dollar store what do you mean yeah the dollar

thank you for the five dollar donation i'm very good at this podcasting thing huh oh no okay what do you want to do yeah yeah what's the topic candy candy candy candy [Music] now", "q-Bw9ipv5ok": "so we're doing some of them you've never done before huh what you're doing tie-dye today right yeah tie-dye so how do you feel about it let me see your hands are they shaking like a surgeon he's ready no problem yeah you guys so Terry told me you guys are gonna split them into like three different color groups and then kind of mix them like like yeah it's gonna mix a couple colors of together okay yeah and this was inspired because of loft watching you know love to pursue its Greg you're gonna give it a whirl yeah we're gonna it won't be like his butt no you don't say that we'll see you want goodbye for you golfing you're ready everyone's been saying that very sorry he's wrecked out for this out to nor shall counter to and let's then come it's a holy Angra needs its cereal this smells really good so what is the actual flavor barium punch orange if you're saying old cliche and gummy go punch somebody all the time I would say couple sets back there so why are we hitting up there the cool entails because we're going to divide this into three pieces we're each gonna man our piece or woman it depending on what you are but we're gonna so we're gonna color it but then we get this whole it and then come back here and swap some colors just sitting around a little complicated exactly so this is gonna buy us a little bit of time by not letting it get too cold hopefully Thank You Ronnie no no no back in the kettle for a second we probably don't want to be you know we aren't gonna be mixing them all on here I think it's time so we're a little squirt down here a little squirt there they told you about these bubbles the clown middlesex let you do all this oh wait every time I shoot a video oh hey well yeah not necessarily every time you shoot a video could be every - ah - - every time I hear that could just be my thing I'm not known for being perfect hey Steve I said I'm not known for being perfect yes you are yeah yeah ouch so what is he right now actually no that's my wonderful son from another mother one of many your collector right yeah I have a collector of sons so what was your question I've seen Greg he'll like yeah but then it almost looks like he's holding on to the corner with I don't know we want to be quite that tricky well I'm just trying to think like like whenever we try to split the batches this is more liquid than typical and whenever we do it we have to pull the batch away as we're cutting it otherwise it comes back together no no we'll figure it out maybe or unless we don't we might just have brown tie dye earthtones panic max noises [Music] requite panting yeah give it a minute you will there's so many things that could go wrong here man what are we gonna do it trust me this could affect us for the rest of our lives at least for the next couple of minutes yeah well that looks really easy mmm it is I'm just making about what I do okay so we've got a nice warm ish table which is gonna come in handy oh it's warm make sure everybody else is ready okay okay max oh that didn't really work though yeah it's terrible how we gonna keep it separate yeah you're right hey Steve may be different yeah I mean know your books so hard you're gonna have this little piece of candy here well if your name is Greg it takes you one if you're so far it takes three but we might do put the camera down another stop oh I guess we should be telling what's going on here okay so we're taking the challenge that we gave Greg we're taking the challenge back we're gonna make tie-dyed okay - we're poaching his techniques we studied the game film you saw how Greg did and we're like okay well I don't think we one person wants to do that she really wanted to make tie-dye but you can figure it out so she was like oh so we have first of all you gotta know your color wheel okay so we're taking our primary colors of blue red and yellow pulling them on the hook then we're coming back to our warm tail so we couldn't do it without this whole cooling table but right now and put hot water through here so it's a warming table so gonna we're gonna each take a turn and pull our handy on the hook then when we come back we're gonna swap pieces out we have to make orange so I'll take your head hash yellow mix that up in the orange I'm gonna make purple so I'm gonna take half half red make purple then we're gonna take meat green which will be half blue half yellow make green I'll see that again I will do it Steve I think my head's spinning honey make orange orange yeah I don't know what that is that's adopted now we still gonna use the welding gloves or where we just use pull out right here magic don't make me come after you the colors always been really awesome alright not bad it's like a mini competition everyone's gonna have to fall in luck candy triathlon yeah dude I've been losing for a candy little bit so yeah I can't do that I think it's because of the color cuz that's that's kind of what I'm using to to allow me to do mine oh the stupid stick yeah oh it's the biggest batch of ever thrown I don't know my arms are getting shaky believe in yourself no believe in the heart of the cards huh it's kind of weird I gotta tell you really tense we're tested you in yeah I'll hit the camera don't test me all right how red are we going here is this just leave it here should I give you someone who should we swap our colors now I mean what do you think I think this is pulled enough yours actually does already look like Oh what's my name again Wow this is the right color yeah well I need somebody hit hammer hammer time we've decided that I don't have to pull mine so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna divide our little colors into thirds and we're start so we're gonna play the swifty swappi game okay okay so if we do this man this is huge it's roughly it doesn't have to be even remotely even just come close is that gonna work off thirds well just let me feel that there doesn't have to be even no I mean the colors at the end we know we're gonna make it no we're gonna make a flat layer so if there's two thirds going into orange but we have to give red I have to give one red and one red so then the the secondary colors will be twice as much as the primary today that's what and these two together are gonna equal turf all this is me and I'm gonna give you I don't really care come on it was ripped off that's true what mix mix this these together mix them together they're gonna be equal great no maybe some mixed some neat I like this just mix them together to remember as a kid having later that was it okay this is alright I won't get in trouble yoanne oh you're gonna get in trouble anyways Max is coming together really cool yeah that's right I'm cooler than you guys said yeah yeah I want turn an orange orange alive right because I'm stronger and faster I'm not gonna do that although my arms is a little close to red so we'll keep it oh I'm trying look at the stripes we don't want start well mix it up do you like you do I want to try yours that's looking green that's what we're she's like a platinum purple right now I guess we can start off Oh Greg uses a rolling pin do we have a rolling pin - quick the scheme Jim I was gonna say miss Carla theorist oh we're just hanging okay yes we don't do we have never a dull I'll take it if it wasn't labeled Oh doesn't say for candy only hey this is green no okay that's it so everybody make your stuff black guys want this cause I'm gonna use my rhythm method I just found my thumbnail okay I'm just gonna decided the order that we're gonna kind of stiff for us to be pulling let's pair hurry up let's see if he'll do purple on top of the orange hair and this does not have to be exact light dark light dark really handsome colors anyway this feels like like an airhead or something it's you know Steve has said that this is ixnay on the even candy ray and as we turned this one into ribbon candy what you want the red right next to the orange we'll take your greens Wow Wow I'm on God give us the cruddy okay yay teamwork no we're not out of the woods yet any work no whoa she's curling it to make the tie-dye circle and then we'll form it into a triangle for dodge yeah have you like watch the video no I made this all up from my brain big brain okay it's all for you now I do the honors well you can do [Music] that means no one met speaker i means I don't know misty please don't make me please don't make me I'm so nervous I could it also screw it up [Music] can't wait any think just like a newborn baby 21 pounds and 3 feet long oh we have to taste this - yeah I think you know think it'll stay nice and soft in front of the heat from your lips to God's ears I'm sure listen I'm trying to I'm willing the positivity into this candy all right cuz it looks too good to not work please triangles bro that looks so cool oh wow yeah look it there it is there it is that's the way it is that's the way it so Steve how do you think it's coming out looks pretty neat yeah I like it probably look really cool in the the packages cuz I know that Terry said that she wants to do packet sets some of this in the fruit and friendly ones and then their own tie-dye yeah so it'll be cool to see an entire package full of these rainbow sick it's not burning my mouth you finally got something right to you all these years I took all day are you sneaking some already Terry you can see me I knew you couldn't stand you can stay away from the tie-dye tie-dye tees good this is Kara hey everybody it's Dylan I was just sitting here doing my edit of the hard candy video and realized when I was doing this taste test with Kara that there was some music playing in the background typical me I didn't realize that that was music going on and we can't have that in the videos so I just wanted to do a little voiceover let you know that kara loves the hard candy she loves the fruit punch flavor and she can't wait for the second without telling me I think they still do that I think they do have I think my kids a lot of a die I always just hit the reset button how do you know because of the way it birds can fly north so any direction and it's totally up to them I think what I'm excited about is the next guy see what happens you know and that's the coolest part is like I think a lot of people think that you guys would be like test it once it works out perfectly or something you know what I mean or you doing it's the best way and then when we keep trying to it make things better yeah keep giving the riddles and stuff that we make all the time we're always trying to well I mean you guys did cashew and peanut brittle this time and then recently just fixed and brittle yeah and that's like that's my new favorite yeah that's also I never knew how good it was and then we did it it was like my eyes were opened yeah first time we got the first batch man the first batch yeah I bought you can't send a little too early but they tasted like Oreos man the whole what it tasted like Oreos to me I know everybody else they call me crazy [Laughter] yeah oh wow Alec it all nice work men yeah it looks like s you candy just wait a sec it's all or a cute boy yeah oh wow yeah you're right I got a blanket over looks just like that maybe we're a little biased I think it's pretty cool while we're making very nice trip you really like who's hot Oh hot I was always on the ball pulling over tow he's a little fruity he's okay with citrus [Music] it's pretty cool worried about that almost coming through analysis very 70s yeah well yeah it looks completely different now yeah just from like the last like series mission so now yeah does it for 70s Steve you're a superstar max you did it work okay I mean as in like handling it yeah look it's a little cold yeah but I don't max was a little concerned we got quick Steve on the candies probably if you wait until this cameras off we're gonna tell you I really I mean wallah sir last time you did this get you miscounted in the audience oh really I did miss count four right yeah oh and they caught you they were like thank you you put it and I counted I go so there's no - number two right number two are we doing anything different this time I know I'm gonna arrange the colors a little differently okay and then put into a triangle already done okay yeah I mean it came out awesome but we're real close we're just gonna make more colors oh it well it's just we'll learn it might take us a couple times to get it down okay that's good some of my extra students actually max I just wanna log in to the table want to keep it up - he may be of this pose setup it's pretty cool toward equity oh I'm hoping I want yeah all right we're saying watch our heads like ironically to each other but you really should watch yeah you're behind they do yeah I kicked it back last time that I wanted hit the bear line [Laughter] [Music] what are you thinking about yeah he showed us how to make orange image candy we showed him our technique it's like did we show them how to do a little different something that was so last year I can't rely seems like we're gonna use off-color crops I think yeah let's color - yeah slip I almost busted my butt there no I think you got a crack in it I know I think it said I might supposed to be that I don't know the times you're floating back isn't a bad even this one's in the back you can sell a piece of art I'm thinking less color seriously I'd say take some out yeah I'm going yeah take some not just scoop it out did it again did you get that at drop me yeah I got three four three now yay no I don't think it's another batch okay let's snip it and mix it I don't think this we're gonna mix either Oh fiddlesticks very sticky on my fingers they'll be sticky finger Terry that's really not what I need to be known as it's better about them Terry who runs she runs their walls [Applause] [Music] it's at 1:22 no know if it's gonna stay at this I don't know I'm just gonna get cool enough for us to throw so do you wanna put a lot of cold water longest I actually want us there it's all mixed up and you want it to win get the point where you want it to be cooler just bring it over here how sticky is here man I'm like Ronnie's like in a canvas well yeah well it's not okay it'll be all right I keep sticking like right in the middle here well basically the Sun is your colors on me that's right Mike I don't cause of color and that's kind of widows boom it'll still be a Primerica sticks to the canvas all right why would it because it's so really that's not oh and I think this video why she's had to be split for parts she said one half and then I don't and I think it'll help us with the color distribution this definitely had some heavy heavy colors in that last batch or you know we gotta throw them first it's still a real toast it feels better that be interesting to see how this yellow turns out to perfect well the longer that we throw it the better it'll go more like pastel I thought you didn't want to be noticed - he finger Terry so we do want to go extra pastel yeah we will go as past those I don't know how do you think Dylan is that changing color anymore Wow looks like it might have change it might i think it's hit it to limit i've been watching in free pass already we got another challenge or approaching oh okay now last time this turns real quick you know if i want to hook it the way i usually do because it's so small it's kind of harder when it's smaller takes a lot of focus years of training oh yeah they get twice a week for the next year all right toys a week making somebody use the hammer for a minute mommy told me where it is at our front so all right right there right there I see it that's good thank you I'm watching it like so much so as you guys can see there's a lot of multitasking max you're just doing some more handful on you yeah sure hey let's get it off of that hold on you're right okay hammer right yeah that yellow looks a lot different from the first time obviously smear in it so what what are we cutting these into just like you did before Mex it has a different ratio and I don't see how that is when really we're doing we're gonna need six pieces so hopefully colors are gonna be two parts right [Music] [Laughter] [Music] that's your purple okay who's on first nobody is the problem what's on second oh I know who's on first stay Brown I see you've got us beat this time I didn't understand I didn't Steve looks like I felt so wrong doing I think I'll pay the rent no so we're gonna go dark light dark light light and I can get eco six right say that again I know you told me in between batches you had an idea for how you wanted to try and oh yeah no no okay I think if I Steve Steve's away this time and then okay if we you know still wanna experiment I was thinking if we did it like spokes on a wheel then the outside layer would be evenly distributed for the colors well we are gonna do this twice a week next year some of the true-true yeah okay so I must let's start with orange on the bottom where can we do a difficulty on the bottom actually orange on the bottom last time on then it was mostly orange okay what color would you like to do max okay yellow we could build it like a backwards quick whoever's watching write down in the comments which one you wanted yeah so that we can see your comment a week from now yeah run do it in rainbow colors am I one to start late darling let's have yellow next Lakers candy yeah that's accurate going for her hopes do that one else sure can now hold on that's a stretch yeah whatever Network top Seattle you guys are making just too long it doesn't have to be a hundred percent it's okay if it's random ish let's do orange next okay so we're just kind of you know saying like we're still doing it order it's like did somebody say something about cutting this whole mess in half and then no I said that don't care you know okay I don't want to I don't want to mess with the UH okay what's not terrible you know what I'm saying it would have more colors than it would later yeah so I trust you for what right so what does that mean sure all right okay here you go Steve quick you know I got a half an hour what's she trying to say I think she's just pulling our collective chance to put in too much color yeah yeah let's do another batch after this yeah another that got enough less we need more or less more or less he's trying deleting it right here and now [Music] start to go down no yeah just kind of keep it super green guac okay ground beef Mindy lettuce there's some lettuce there's some corn pork a new porky suckered in porky [Laughter] you're a big meanie yeah how's that feel huh you big meanie that's the look at those it looks like one big image on there and then not leave on any more joke's on you [Music] we'll wrap it up right at for anything less Jason Joey don't wanna fall backwards to try to make Fanta phone select roasting this like indicators that's what I was thinking yeah as long as you you're just got to push this much of it but but also trying to keep it separate so too it should be separate though could you guys put it separately right he'll take the clip well okay I mean max I'll take the credit yeah the yellow is making it a lot a lot more vibrant I know it it almost reminds me of two is uh oh is that zebra bubblegum seems right all right subscribers like that right like rainbow ish kind of packaging oh yeah good my mom I can do whatever I want don't don't you mix them up

and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go jolly rancher candy grapes if you enjoyed today's video

in our last video we made a calla lily in candy and that came out really nice but it got me to think back to a point a few years ago maybe four or five where I was given a pack of little image candies that were made in Japan using a different technique I played with the technique about five years ago but my skill level really wasn't up to doing anything that was really interesting with it so I thought I'd revisit it and if you've been watching my Facebook pages you'll see that I've been playing around with this design quite a bit over the past couple of weeks so far I viewed the sugar to 310 degrees and I'm putting in my food coloring and boiling out the extra water that's in the food coloring to make sure the candy doesn't get sticky because I want to keep the background clear and I'm gonna pull the colors I'm putting my citric acid in the colors I'm not gonna have to do this in future batches this first batch was done in raspberry but since then I've gotten in Rose flavoring and I plan to make the future roses to be flavored like a rose I've never had to worry about the background being clear before the only clue I ever used is in that root beer candy but this time I got to keep it clear and I'm working with some cute techniques to do it but I'm sorry I'm not gonna show that to you we have to have our candy make this sequence in the last few videos have been able to put little diagrams in the corner so you can follow what I'm building unfortunately I'm not gonna be able to do it in this video I just don't have time if I'm gonna get this video up this week I do apologize and I'll try to do it in future videos I pulled the amber sugar into white all the time and I'm often asked what happens if you pull a color well the answer is it becomes a pastel and I've started with a pulled pink that's sort of a dark fuchsia I'm gonna add some clear and pull it again and that should get me a light pink for the two shades of pink I want to use in this Rose they could future versions I may try three shades of pink I'm building the center of the Rose from the cylinder and I've sandwiched two shades of red together so that the work at the same time to make an even outline here well I got you here let me ask a favor of you we're up for a popularity contest that's run by Tallahassee magazine but for a whole bunch of categories but two of them are up for online voting and anyone anywhere can vote for them there's a link down under this video in the comment section or rather in the description and if you click on it we'd love for you to vote for lofty pursuits to the food truck category because we have a wonderful ice cream truck made out of an old school bus and in the ice cream category oh and you have to vote before June 16th 2017 we appreciate it this design poses a bunch of problems the big one is I can't use my scrap I think I mentioned in the callalily video that the stripes are a candy makers way of reusing the candy that they made you much of you almost always have to make too much of some of the colors otherwise well what happens if you run short and you use those extras if you have any and you can sort of hide it as stripes in the wrap and that's pretty cool you get more candy you got a prettier piece of candy everyone likes stripes I guess but with this with a clear outside I've got no way to do that because of that the waste on this candy is tremendous I lost about 25 percent of this batch to just scrap and I'm losing probably closer to 50% of some of the other designs unfortunately this means we have to charge a little more for it because we get less candy for the same amount of Labor and we have to use the ingredients anyway but I think the results are worth it the center of the Rose is made and now it's time for the petals so when I started making this video I thought I'd talk about the rose in my yard I have a beautiful climbing Rose vine it's huge the base of the vine is probably twice as big in diameter as my thumb it's has to be 75 years old and it's a Cherokee rose I know that's a state flower of Georgia figured native rose good story Native American tribe it's an invasive species from China you can't know my disappointment hey Georgia yeah you here just 30 minutes north of me let's talk your state flower it's an invasive species now this may be a good symbol for America on a certain historical level but you know there are so many native roses this is my plea listen to me just quickly get it out of the way consider a rose that's native you know here in Florida we changed our state song you can change your state flower come to think about it you replaced your state song as well fairly recently and on goes the first of the petals what's going to make this little different is we're also going to be adding leaves when we're done with the petals one of the things they may not be obvious in our videos is often this is the first time we've ever attempted a design a videotape but because we may never do that design again you know how many letter combinations are there in the world that I'll never do in candy but because of that sometimes these things aren't as good as they are in the 2nd 3rd or 10th or 20th generation I assure you my first strawberry wasn't very good but I can't even tell you how many hundreds of rolls of strawberry I've made since then and they now come out wonderfully this clear wedge of candy the intent was to sort of shape the rows and keep it from getting too round it worked to a certain point think I overdid it a bit but it gave me a new idea of how to control the candy I also wanted you to think we're dealing with clear candies of multiple temperatures adjacent to each other I can't see the difference I can only feel it I'm planning this to be a first of a series of flower candies flavored with the flavour of the flower itself there's a long tradition in Europe of flowered flavored candies and it started in the Middle East rose water was produced by soaking rose leaves and water and preserving it with a little alcohol eventually the Persians and the Turks figured out how to do steam distillation of the flavors and that flavor then could be used in candies and baked goods and that's what we're going to be using in our production batches of this candy but this isn't limited to this one flower the Rose they also do it for orange blossoms they do it for violets in England and they do it for lavender and lavenders kind of important to me as my cousin owns a lavender farm and we're gonna have fun with that in a future video I'm making these green pieces with a triangular cross-section to represent leaves we're gonna put them on the candy roll but I'm gonna put spacers of clear candy in between and this is gonna keep them straight and put them in the right spot but it also means I have more clear candy at another temperature that I can't see the difference between it and other bits the leaves are an adaptation in three dimensions of what I do with stripes but instead of on the outside of the candy they're gonna go near the inside of the candy right around the blossom itself you know there's a problem with these longer formats that he is I got to figure out how to fill them with dialogue you folks say you like to hear me talk you don't just want music you want the talking and the candy making I'm cool with that but it's gonna lead to me filling out some time some time with things I'm gonna read to you so to kill time I'm gonna read some poetry about roses there's so much of it I'm gonna read one of my favorites one perfect rose a single flower he sent me since we met all tenderly his message he chose departed pure with scented do still wet one perfect rose I knew the language of the floret my fragile leaves that said his heart and clothes love long has taken for his amulet one perfect rose why is it no one's ever sent me yet one perfect limousine do you suppose I'll know it's always just my luck to get one perfect rose by Dorothy Parker now we're gonna wrap the rose in our clear wrap and the wrap is gonna get clearer as it cools down it's one of the cool effects we can do with sugar the color sometimes change with temperature if you aren't getting the idea temperature is everything in candy making this is a skill learned by touch not by sight not by these videos and that's a message I want to convey it's very easy to get burned what I'm doing and lots of people have unfortunately for my videos and it makes me sad I encourage you if you want to learn this find somebody to teach you I'm not quite sure how but please be careful out there I hate to think that something that brings me so much a joy can give somebody else so much pain if they don't learn how to do right with the opaque candy when I get to the stage all the time some kid or even grown-up comes up and says hey that looks like a baseball bat or hey that looks like a hot dog this time some kid came up and said hey this looks like a stuffed cabbage leaf and I looked at it and I went you know it does at least it's something I hadn't heard before now we're gonna size these down from the log to the rods and we're gonna take the rods and roll them until they're cool I really like the effect looking at these on end this was really the first moment I was able to see the pattern and not just pay attention to the candy making it looked at first to me like it was a piece of crystal with a rose in the center maybe like one of those old paper weights in the 1940s and I thought that was really cool so I've got my crystal roses here and my crystal candy and all that's left week to do is to chop them into pieces I think my yield was about 800 pieces in about 20 bags of candy down almost 30%

from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections their gourmet candies custom-made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the ride into pieces almost 2 feet long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an al I know a V Andy oh why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering is in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the wrong candy comes off the cooling table is transparent to make it opaque or light in the color they'll pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand it's your new sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops if you have any comments about the show or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows drop us a line at Science Channel com /how it's made", "Z2-64BHNNIc": "Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make another recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today Gems and stones can be found in so many different video games including one of my favorite games, Zelda You collect a little rupees, so today we are gonna be making rupee hard candies The recipe is a simple hard candy recipe, which you can dye to be different colors And we're gonna be using the mold from my baking line We're gonna be using this shape this gem shape is a hexagon which means it has six sides And it's the most similar looking to a rupie. I just love this gem mold It's so cute And it has shapes that I have been wanting for a really long time. And side note, you guys our swirl silicone mold was trending number one on Amazon for molds. If you want to help this mold become number one mold on Amazon, I'll put a link down below because if this becomes number one then the poo mold becomes number two. (laughing) In the book, I dyed the rupies red blue and green because I felt those were the most iconic But I really love this recipe because you can make them any color you want. Today, we're gonna be making the same hard candies with the same colors, but I'm gonna be using different flavors Let's get started! The things you'll need to make these hard candies will be: a mold I'm using the mold from my baking line And I'm only gonna be using the hexagon shapes. For the recipe, you'll need three cups of sugar 3/4 cup water, 1 cup of light corn syrup, 1 teaspoon of blueberry oil. 1 drop a blue dye 1 teaspoon of strawberry oil, one drop of red dye, one teaspoon of green apple oil, and one drop of green dye now. Let's put it all together! The ingredients in front of me is enough to make 3 different colors I like to make mine one at a time because when you're working with hot candy I don't like to separate it and move it around too much because it's just so hot the first thing that we're gonna do is Take 1/3 of our sugar water and corn syrup and pour them into a pot. Pour our sugar, that means we'll need 1 cup then. We'll need a quarter cup of water and a third cup of corn syrup Woah! (laughing) There we go! Then we add the one drop of food coloring I'm gonna start with green because I'm wearing a green shirt and the flavoring that we're using is apple And I just love apple hard candy so start with the good stuff. It's all good, but this is just like my favorite Use a toothpick to scoop, it in mix together until all the sugar is wet now We'll take this sauce pot over to the stove. Place your pot onto the stove turn the heat to medium and allow the sugar to completely dissolve. Once dissolved, place the candy thermometer into your pot and cook the candy until it reaches 275 degrees. Then, turn off the stove heat and take your candy syrup back to the baking station. Once you take your hard candy off the stove, pour immediately into a heat safe container with a pour spout at the end. And before we pour the candy into the mold add your Flavoring I'm using green apple! Whisk together work that flavoring in there. Oh yeah! Now pour your hot candy syrup into your mold and be careful because it's very hot I'm only filling them about 2/3 because I want them to be a little bit more bite-sized. Once you've poured the candy, let them sit for 45 minutes to harden. While this sits, I'm gonna make a couple more batches using our other colors. You can do it this way if you have multiple molds otherwise just wait till they've hardened and repeat I've given the candies plenty of time to harden. Pop them out, it's super easy This is one of the reasons why I love Silicone molds because they're bendy! Tug this way, tug, tug, tug, stretch it out, and the other way, then flip it upside down and pop 'em out! These look amazing! Oh my gosh you guys! Now do this for the rest of your candy Tada! There you have it here are the rupee hard candies that we made today. The recipe is from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook But, we switched the flavorings. We made green apple flavored, blueberry, and strawberry. One of the things that I love about hard candy recipes, is it's very customizable. You can make your hard candies any colors you'd like and any flavor. growing up one of my favorite candies were Jolly Ranchers So I love making a homemade hard candy recipe. Easy-peasy bite-sized and delicious! omnomnomnomnom I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on rosannapansino.com Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these little hard candies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day! And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies please let me know leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen! Alright thanks again, you guys, bye-bye and now I have a candy for me! I'm gonna have a green apple one. Growing up, my favorite Jolly Ranchers were green apple and watermelon. Let me know in the comments below what your favorite Jolly Rancher flavor is", "mZPUMQ0So_g": "okay we have one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a fourth a cup of water we're just going to stir stir stir over medium heat i do medium because i don't want my sugar to burn so and i'm not using can of sugar in this one um i'm just showing you so and you're only going to stir until it starts to boil and it is starting to boil so now we're going to insert our candy thermometer and you're going to insert it and you're going to let it boil and do not stir until your candy thermometer reaches 305 degrees do not stir at all and then remember we want it to get to 305 degrees okay we are at 305 degrees so we are going to remove it from the heat and let the temperature drop back down to 280 degrees all right our temperature has dropped back down to 280 so now we're going to add in well i'm adding in distillate i'm also adding in tincture we're going to stir we're gonna add in our candy flavoring um it's one to two teaspoons of candy flavoring i eyeball it gonna add our food coloring [Music] i'm using americana red because i'm doing a fruit punch candy and the recipe is the same for hard candies than it is for suckers same recipe and then you immediately pour into your moles um you have to pour fast because it gets hard fast and then you just let it set out at room temperature until it gets hard um it takes about 30 to 45 minutes um humidity and the temperature in your house they play a big part in how your candy's set up okay they have been cooling for about 45 minutes now we're gonna pop them out this is just the batch i'm doing for me so i'm okay to touch it with my hands lego man i recommend using silicone molds because it is easier to get them out of and like if there's excess you can just break it off do little hard candies you", "1Teck1q0S8s": "\u266b Guitar Jazz Music \u266b", "P6PJeQHZ_sM": "hi I'm Margie for Marjorie's candies and welcome to my kitchen today we're going to make old-fashioned butterscotch hard candy and what you'll need to get started is two cups of sugar a quarter of a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of butter and I melt that before I get started 2 tablespoons of water and 2 tablespoons of vinegar and I have a little mold and I can pour some to make some little squares of butterscotch candies and then I have some sticks so I'm going to use for lollipops and you're going to want to put a little butter on that matter of fact I'll do that right now with my little knife what I have here is how can we help you in the end it is lollipops also take a little bit ok so I'm going to add this to my pot first of all that's the bottom of course I think it will just TSP and I took out and then I'm going to in here is two tablespoons of the water and two tablespoons of the vinegar then it's a quarter of a cup of corn syrup Eddie and the sugar that's two cups of sugar one of the little corn syrup that was stuck there okay with a spoon I'm just going to gently when I make candy I think I've mentioned this before I always stir from the outside and to keep the to keep the crystals of sugar from sticking to the side of the pot you really want this to come to a boil before and I'm sorry you want the sugar to melt before it comes to a boil whenever you're making candy sometimes when you have butter it's a little hard to tell but it could pick up your spoon you can usually see this see if there's a the butter color okay you have close and you see if you pick that up and look you don't really see any crystals in there and I don't suggest that you run your fingers through it and try to tell if you could feel them because this is pretty hot so now it's going to come to a boil we'll let it come to a boil and you're going to this this one's going to go up to 300 degrees so you want to get a candy thermometer so you know after that means that before it burns actually you'll be able to tell that made about 300 we don't get it off the stove it will burn so that as hot as your kid is ever going to get a lollipop okay now you want that little bulb that little red bulb will be under the water under this solution and if you don't think that it is that it pretty much is I'm just going to boil up a little bit still you can layer thermometer flat the other direction like this and just watch it every so often just pick it up this is reached 300 okay all right so we'll take this off I'm actually going to let it just rest for a few moments rather than pouring the opposite and when you pour it on it's a little bit thick if you don't wait if you wait a little while to get it looking a bit darker and it will pour better so I'll just let it cool okay so now we've waited a little while you see how it looks a little darker and it's nice and some looks nice and smooth so I'm going to pour this into the Train I really went over this the butter because it is very very very important that you butter it because it will if you have it if you have a straight I mean an offset spatula it works fantastic on these models okay you just want to make sure they're all filled up okay okay so that's very good so we can set that aside just to get cool it takes almost a half an hour really the coolant possibly and then I'm going to take lollipop spoons and we're just going to make actually I'm going to make a little if you hold it really still it'll just make a circle and you don't need it to be tremendous okay and you put your Spears stick and just give it a little a little twist there we go okay and you just keep doing that hold it real still and they will get see when you wait a little while for you can give it a little roll you wait a little while gets a little bit thicker so it just holds up a little better rather than spreading way out wait even longer just it gets even it gets even thicker I'll wait a moment for this and I'll show you some that it even thicker a little sick or even probably could spoon it out that might be a little bit better maybe not that will spread out some you know it looks pretty bad okay just take your two things in okay so thank you very much for watching me do this and you're pretty good let me know what you think about them", "lVCdtzVV58s": "whoo okay ready for this ghost pepper candy okay it's really hot in here that's what I

can there's a little notch and I can't even open it with the dog can I not open to anything but I have to use my scissors right oh there's no water no I thought I expected it to be spicy spelling but

expecting it to be real Bob and I'm sure close that up smash that a is no just take my madree last a drink who one reason why I'm kind of stalling but one reason why I'm doing this last besides they I don't want to do it because I didn't want to ruin the rest of the food i was eating so yeah time for this it's really small but it's really why not we buy cursive I feel the berry coming home I ends up food to the back of my throat it's on my tongue like the verb and have you ever felt the feeling when you're about to eat hot wings and it goes up here like chicken wings and goes up your nose like smell and it's just Billy I don't know what hurts me this isn't so bad like you taste the spice Oh wanna do that Oh miss Tony the pepper does not taste good I feel the spice but does not really like i like i love spicy food so maybe that's why I like this is just spicy and it's watermelon so it's like toned down a little bit um I should probably figure so I'm not faking it like it is hot but it's not hot like it's actually like making me cry make me burn up I mean I'm kind of red right now but just cuz the heat the main part is when like maybe like it gonna sit back here through it like quickly that's why I soft I'm not saying that I am NOT trying to make myself seem more manly but I really like cool it like yeah the worst thing that's when it gets to like when it goes to the back of your throat and your tongue watch your tongue is bearing the whole time but it's really not that bad I don't to it oh wow Oh No so I try to chew with my mouth open ya know it's the best flavor right the watermelon flavor is a really good and then the pepper oh don't touch your tongue like that all the space will not you back your throat yeah it's hot though but um the pepper isn't that good taste in men I'll give this to my dad he lost my seafood no I mean not give the whole enjoyed their like give one to my dad's attorney what am I gonna share uh huh see I saw one it's not see ya the burdens away after her down move pepper there's no pw yeah that\u00eds the ghost pepper what about spicy wanna know one pin yeah I don't really see a lot of these are these I've seen like one and yeah that is this and I'll see you all later bye", "fZwPhSCIlLI": "today I'm going to be making cinnamon rock candy it's actually a pretty easy thing to do except it takes a long time to do it about an hour but it doesn't have very many ingredients as long as you can babysit it for a while you're good to go it's actually a pretty easy thing to do so I have 3 and 3/4 cup sugar 1 more 1 and 1/4 cup of corn syrup 1 cup of water and you'll need a teaspoon of red food coloring and a teaspoon of cinnamon oil and you can get the cinnamon oil at a cake food store they don't normally sell it or you can buy it online now you're gonna dump your sugar in the corn syrup the water you'll do a teaspoon the red food coloring turn it on to medium-high heat and what you're going to do stir it in all together will start to melt together here but this will become very syrupy you're going to let this boil on medium high heat stirring occasionally and this process takes about 15 minutes to do to get it to boil ok so when it comes to a boil then I have to take a lid and stick that on there for three minutes okay so now my sugar crystals are all dissolved so I'm going to take the lid off and mature my fan on now and it's going to be nice so then I'm going to take now I'm going to take my candy thermometer stick it right on the edge just like that I'm gonna go up I need it to get to 300 degrees before I can call it good here so it'll just go up a little bit and this will process will probably take about 20 to 25 minutes depending on how high your so yours going to leave it you don't stir it you just let it go and you'll let it boil and come check it often okay so well that's just cooking we're going to prepare for our next part of this and you want to get like an ax I think this is 11 by 16 just a piece of tinfoil so it's got a wall on each side because you don't want your candy sticking to the pan at all for touching the pan so once you get that done you're gonna take either butter or margarine something doesn't matter and what I do I stick it on a napkin I know this is weird but I'm give it a good heavy coat because it is hard to get the candy off of this if it is not buttered it's just about done I'm going to dump a teaspoon of cinnamon oil in that and then I'm going to take it over here and I know this is a crazy setup but it really does work I've set a fan I'm going to open my window and all the steam from the sin roll because it's very potent is going to go out the window and not in my house and I'm going to dump it on my tray here that we've got buttered okay this is ready to go so I'm going to take this down I'm going to be very careful and you should too nuts you don't want to burn the inside of your nose and so I'm going to shut my heat off dump that in I'm going to turn my fountain it's not going to do anything until I stir it and then it's going to go crazy let me get out of the way make sure it's good and stir it in they're going down here is not open here we go now we're going to do this select your cow don't try to scoop it out or just whatever's in there they kind of rock it back a core just to make sure it's to the corners and there's your tray of silicon okay so once it's hardened for about 45 minutes I will go ahead and put a piece of wax paper over the top of it to keep it from getting stuff on it and so it's nice for you and you can keep it like this for overnight if you need to so next thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave this on here while I crack it so I've washed at the end of a hammer and I'm just going to take it and that's it so I got to do okay so the next part after you have hammered it you're going to flip it over and so the wax paper is now on the bottom and I've already peeled off all of the tinfoil so you just peel it off and put that aside so this is kind of what it looks like any next you're going to take some powdered sugar and I have a sifter and you can sprinkle it on but I feel like this does a pretty good job and what I do is just sift it over the candy and then once you're done you call it good then what you do you can get little gift bags like this I like to get them after Christmas every year because then they're super cheap not that they're already cheap but they're now they're super cheap and then you just take your little scooper here up with the bait down so you can see and I'm guessing I can do about ten ten bags worth per batch that I do but I don't seal them up until I know for sure that I have enough in each bag so that's it and what I'll do is just take a little tie tie it around and sometimes I'll even so there's your little cute bag of candy it's really fun sometimes they'll take ribbon and put it around - and tied someone's name on it but that's how you make cinnamon candy from start to finish um thanks for listening", "QdtmCXD3BNI": "for being jolly and eating ranchers read Jolly Ranchers get ready for that sweet sugar rush I don't like sweet fruit and

welcome back to the sugar test kitchen today I'm making habanero salted watermelon some of you guys have asked for videos that are longer and unedited so this video is a real-time video and then the next video that I'm uploading is an edited high speed video so choose which one you want to watch or watch both it's all good with me enjoy the video so here I'm adding a mixture of citric and malic acid to make it a little bit tangy without any acids the candies are just gonna taste like nothing in a real fruit you've got tang Ennis what's the same concept in a candy [Music] here I'm adding a new addition to the sugar pantry it's a sea salt from the Jacobson Salt Company that's infused with habaneros it's really salty it's got a little bit of a kick to it it's really nice not as much heat as I wanted so I've also gonna add some habanero powder into it as well which is from Silk Road spice merchants here in Calgary it gives it a really nice heat something that's gonna smack you in the face but still be really nice on the palate you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here I'm pulling half of the sugar until it's shiny and opaque I want it to be quite a bit lighter than the unpooled sugar so it has a nice contrast in the design to the candies it also makes the candies feel a lot nicer in the mouth and gives you the ability to crunch through them if you wanted us crazy people that likes to bite through their candies [Music] [Music] a pattern that I'm going for in these candies is really soft and subtle I like the contrast of a really spicy really intense candy with a subtle soft design that sort of tricks your mind into thinking that you're not gonna be eating something and crazy hot that's gonna make your mouth burn in your eyes water to have the such a contrast is really nice in these candies because it's just a nice baby pink it's it's a nice candy it's so innocent nothing's gonna happen when you eat them it's also a good way to trick your friends into thinking that you're just being really nice and giving them a candy [Music] I actually have a funny story about our spicy candies I have a customer who buys our candies all the time and he has them on his desk but he keeps complaining about his work colleagues who keep stealing his candies it was driving him crazy so one day what he did was he bought our pick-and-mix but also bought some spicy candies and mixed them in with his pick-and-mix because they really don't look any different he could find out who would take his candies when he'd see someone walking through the office with tears streaming down their face because they had a ghost pepper candy or habanero candy that looked just like a nice innocent candy they thought that they were maybe getting a peppermint they're a bit wrong he says he's never had an issue with anybody stealing this candy since of course I do have to add that I don't condone this but desperate times call for desperate measures [Music] while I'm pulling these rods I just want to explain a little bit about how pick-and-mix I've had so many emails and questions asking what is pick-and-mix how does it work and i have people who want to try 18 flavours and the Lord that 18 boxes not understanding that they can mix them and then want interchange so the way that it works is that you pick a box size you can have small medium large or extra large which is coming soon and you pick the flavors that you want to go in that box so say you want salted caramel salted licorice peppermint it's fizzy elderflower with strawberry and fizzy Cola you pick those on our list on the website and then I'll mix those flavors into one box for you just for the cost of one box so you get to try all of those flavors without having to buy a box of every single flavor if you want to buy a box for just one flavor that's completely fine as well that's an option on our website but a picker mix is a way for you to get more freedom and to try as many candies as you like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] now we have to keep the rods around to stop the count these from being all flat and misshapen the candies are still edible of course if that happens but they're just not as aesthetically pleasing so we like to do this just have to say that chopping these rods was a pain because of the salt in them and the spices they don't cook cleanly like regular candies so they like to chip off in really small pieces and really big pieces that you have to go back in and chop again definitely not my favorite candies to cut they taste really good but boy were they paint [Music] so those of you who stayed to the end of this video thank you so much for watching these candies will definitely be made in our commercial kitchen and they'll be up for sale on our website this Sunday please stay tuned at Stewie's wwg candy com thanks please like and subscribe and have a great day [Music]", "8Yki13g42mo": "step-by-step process of making watermelon heart candy for one full-size batch they combine seven pounds of corn syrup into a copper kettle 14 pounds of sugar in two quarters of water oh as well as one teaspoon of cream of

hard candies are made here they add in the color and flavoring oil [Music] fyi this video is made for educational and entertainment purposes only making hard candy is a dangerous process due to high temperatures used to make it [Music] so if you attempt to make this at home you do so at your own risk [Music] the candy stands stretched on a hook they stretch it to add in air bubbles which turn the candy white [Music] the color is already changing they combine different color stripes to make the candy [Music] so far so fun [Music] then they put the candy through the fancy candy cutter [Music] so yummy [Music] this looks like candy heaven [Music] which is your favorite flavor by the way [Music] after they're all cut they wait for the candies to cool down and back them up for you to buy yup this is definitely candy heaven go get your bags folks [Music] [Applause] would love to hear what you thought of the process enjoy the candies [Music] until next time you", "IyGcwdRzPSc": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to four different kinds of old-fashioned hard candies these are clays candies and they've been around since 1919 Zac syntheses from South Bend Indiana he said that normally they're a dollar ninety-nine but they were on sale in his store for 99 cents so he was able to pick up these fours for $4 I think that's awesome I have the wild cherry and the Lemon Drop root beer and cinnamon and we are we are not going to be able to sit here and like suck on a whole candy so what we're gonna do is we're going to be disgusting we're gonna put a piece in our mouth and we're gonna taste it for a while and then we have a paper towel that we're going to lay it on so that we can go on to the next flavor but we will be able to tell you what it tastes like to us okay so this is the wild cherry these are artificially and naturally flavored they're fat-free and gluten-free it says now you can enjoy that old-fashioned wild cherry flavor and some delicious martini try some today I wonder if they're all the same calories 3463 460 whether 20 calories aged no made the same they're just flavored oh they do have a lot of other flavors they have natural horehound peppermint green apple the watermelon they have a bunch Randall berry do a lot more around always it really really strong for me okay this is the cherry oh and I love this it has a powdered sugar you look hooded and shut up I'll have a picture of them at the end so you can see they're very very pretty candies you could even for these out into a candy dish yes to me that tastes like a pop drop but no but I like it - the medicine yeah you don't really strong - mm-hmm you don't get the medicine apart but it's just a red cherry hmm but if you do not like cherry cough drops I don't think you would like that because that is exactly what does look it's not like a cherry watch savoring - it's not like a jury laughs I know it's like a cherry cough problem yeah because I'm meeting if you're sit in the meeting and one was cut off his penis now this is women some of those are really big yeah some of these aren't are like giant size also you have to get through the sugar-coated we get the point [Music] not fast for the part of s1y I hate that down - wow I just got the lemon it's really strong mmm now see I like that I like that buy that mmm is it too limiting to you it's not like you know like we've said before a cleaner like furniture polish or something like that that is not like that at all this is more like during an eliminator it's like yeah I'm like lemonade that's a good yeah I like that a lot quite quite good mm-hmm that it's just like a lemonade I wonder if you put them like if you mix them and put them in a candy dish together if the plenty because I don't think so because they're coated with that sugar all right so you could do that what's your favorite barks are aimed at me and we drink the diet and it's so good yeah diet barks it's better than the diet NW but I think I like anomic barks probably barks is the best one the barks is never on sale and they don't put it in bottles around here yeah we like to drink it out of the bottle yeah you always buy I am Debbie because that's what's on sale involved mm-hmm aren't they smaller model soon dude 16-ounce ball no the 12:05 I hope those guys have a good climate oh yes and you can tell that it's not sugar-free you can tell that that's like the full flavor that's the that's the real deal and root beer if you don't get the barrels after you eat Oh mold for a while but her mouth my mouth start our leeks with her tongue out - yeah they're so strong mmm they're very very good that is under excellent mm-hmm do you do you like those or the barrels I like these better these tastes that are quality noodles I agree the barrels piece cheaper I agree now this that's cinnamon sometimes the best for last I'm not a lover of cinnamon I like red hots I like atomic fireballs good hardball please I take out my own name this one's not gonna be like that though mm-hmm that's just a really nice yeah like a cinnamon disco that's exactly looks like it's a cinnamon desk mm-hmm except the cinnamon disks are wider yeah and this these have on around this room hmm that's really really good very strong flavor I'm wondering if I'll lay it next to the cherry if I could tell the difference in the color now it's the same friend it looks like the like the exact same red that's the cherry so you wouldn't be able to tell that that is my favorite out of the four our curriculum um I like a cherry I like a cinnamon cinnamon is good it's just uh there's something I want you all at home mmm that's nice I like the since the cinnamon is my favorite then what I will do I don't know how a lot of people do these I said you could put them in a candy dish for me though I like to put some in a baggie and a ziplock baggie and keep it in my purse and like Kevin has put it in Ziploc baggies and put it in his bag for meetings and stuff like that Kevin loves taking stuff like this for me I'm sure the person next to me love yeah you know why do you have nice breath I would rather have someone with nice breath and squishy noises yeah that's someone with a bad breath you know so yeah so and thank you very much as I these are really really good I like them and now that I've seen that name clays I'll have to be on the lookout for all around here to see if we have other flavors so I really appreciate you all Center me this I think you send me these I should I have a picture of one that's pattern and one the done powder another man wants to see the slobbery things okay no they're not slobbery they're not slobbering than the sugar oh yeah I'll take a picture and you all will know that these have been sucked on but that's okay and and I'll take some with the powder and then some without so that you can see what they look like because they're really pretty I love them with the powder on them I think they're gorgeous so I hope you enjoyed the video if you've had these before or other flavors that you really like leave me a comment below cuz I would like to hear about your experiences and thanks for

it into some of these molds there's 60 of these lollipops we're going to take them apart put them all in the pot to melt them down and see how many hard candies we can make well that took some time was stressful it's sticky but it's beautiful so let's melt it down and add some distillate it's like rainbow bright colors i'm going to start it on medium melting this down you want to just kind of keep stirring that see how it locks up and then we're gonna add once it's all melted so 60 lollipops and a half gram of distillate let's see if we get around 30 of them i don't know i'm trying everything's sticky like my feet everything's sticky but this is almost melted down it's pretty viscous add the distillate to this melted and even we have a measuring cup in the oven at 200 degrees

i'll do a taste test in a little bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's 23 all together if we had used a gram of the distillate and we made 23 it would be about 35 milligrams a serving so since we

jell-o ready put some in the sugar as it's boiling not all of it just some pock scraper is very effective especially in the stride out state do not lose the pot scraper I have a rata added the first amount of tincture that I showed you the other amount is waiting just gonna do some bubbling and boiling you don't have to stir it constantly but it's a good idea to stir it regularly already at 2:26 this candy thermometer has a cover that has a guide on it candy on the right hard crack 302 Fahrenheit I was previously only going to 250 275 which got you somewhere between fall and soft crack the fall is going to be chewier the hard crack is going to be just like a hard candy it'll start looking a little bit frothy that's alright it's normal just keep doing the stirring a little bit we're already at 236 within a couple of minutes try to scrape the edges every once in a while to keep it all incorporated it's going to get a little bit thicker keep going we're almost 300 first put the teacher in still won't but it'll break down with stirring it turn down a little bit we got a little too hot out of jell-o try not to fling it around in the pot that's pretty much what you put on the sides you're not going to get off keep it on the heat you can lower the heat a little bit keep it on the heat so that you can keep stirring the jello in just be in the pot looks like like super sure to get all the edges and top bottom so you know you got all your jello and your team's you're mixing okay scoot over you did hurry to try and get as much of it out of the pot as you can before it starts doing the stringing crap nothing but once it's in the tray let it cool a little bit where you start spreading it other ways you get that so it's best to try and pour it across this mold as best you can so you don't have to mess with it a lot still a little warm spreading that as it gets cold or cooler it's easier to just push around where you want places where it slowly I'm just kind of try to get rid of the lines these are it's not a big deal for your personal use but if you're gonna sell it these are harder to deal with it's not square it's harder to make them all level just don't look as nice but if you're starting with this tray you will probably get closer to looking nicer like that rather than the partial pour where you don't really know how much fill of your mold you just on a poori so these are a little bit thick and sloppy looking you try and mash them down but as they get cooler they're just gonna snap off Chrome's like that", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more videos please remember to subscribe to\nthis channel thank you guys so much goodbye and see you in the next video and just a side note these would be great\nparty gifts or party favors for adults", "yYj69U9Toh0": "good morning YouTube it's been about a month I'm super sorry I've been cheating and making Facebook live videos instead of making videos for you guys but it's so much easier I don't have to edit anything not that I do anyway um and I can just post a live no worries no mess no fuss but unfortunately I'm not popular enough on YouTube to make live videos you need like a thousand followers I'm only at 119 so it is what it is but as always we are going to start our candy making adventure off with a nice good hit of marijuana from altitude organic on North Academy Boulevard in Colorado Springs Colorado check them out oh yeah that's the stuff alright so today I know I already have a herd candy making video shut up battery I'm trying to make sour hard candy today a couple months ago I made some amazing amazing sour mango hard candy I've given it to people all over town everyone loved it they were like I want more a lot more well my foolishness is showing cuz I didn't write down the recipe it was an experiment and it just turned out amazing I've tried like four times to replicate this recipe it has not worked so I'm trying again today but we're not gonna do mango we're gonna do strawberry and watermelon and what I'm going for is for a sour profile if any of you are old enough to remember Altoid sours that came in this wonderful - round tin they actually the sour mango that's our tangerine and I'm not sure I think the lemon was the other flavor they've been discontinued for years they were the perfect amount of sour and the sours stuck with you it wasn't just like I hit a sour on the outside it was all the way through so I'm going to do my best to replicate something to that level of sour because those were delicious and I don't know a single person who was familiar with them that would not love to have them back so if I can make them awesome alright let me show you what I got for ingredients first we have 400 grams of sugar or 2 cups that you prefer to use cups which is foolish you should always wait things I also have about 3/4 of a cup water if you add too much it's totally ok you just can't add too little the water will evaporate off so I like to add the water next because it kind of makes a little easier with the next step yeah I just poured in the corn syrup which is why you want to put the water in first if you put corn syrup on sugar it gets very viscous and it's very hard to stir so the water kind of helps break it up but this is 2/3 cup corn syrup or if you want to be awesome and weigh things 213 grams it is so much easier to weigh your corn syrup if you know it everything weighs it's so much easier if you ever try to get corn syrup out of a cup or a bowl oh my god you end up wasting so much and I know there's ways to like grease it and it's just a waste of time just weigh everything or use the measurements that I've given you and I've already done all the hard work here we go 1 cup flour under 20 grams 1 cup sugar to anagrams etc etc etc etc etc these have all been tried and true I have taken legit measuring cups not crap ones and done the work if someone wants to copy this it will save you so much time here are the next ingredients I have some generic flavors you know Loraine oils sorry Loraine nothing against you but there are better options out there I got watermelon I've got some amazing chef rubber confectionary candy color I love chef rubber they are the best prize so much more above the rest there's my song for you guys um go check out chef rubber chef river com they have everything you'll ever need I talk about them shamelessly in every I'm not saying this because they're paying me I'm not saying this because I'm getting anything out of it seriously nothing out of it I just love this company it's amazeballs and you will love it too so go check them out we also have some Lorraine oil tart and sour tart and sour is a liquid acid that has citric acid and malic acid and then over here I made my own liquid citric acid I just mix some warm water with some powdered citric acid it is tart oh my lord I tried it and about Burma tongue off so different a chicken the difference between citric acid and malic acid from my understanding citric acid the road sever Malik's a little bit more sir but citric acid is used mm-hmm on top of candies like favor head sour straws or sour belts that's citric acid on top if you were to put malic acid on top oh my god you burned a hole right through your Facebook it'd be so bad so the the malic acid unlike the citric acid sticks around citric acids great but it's only good for a short burst it doesn't linger through the candy but the malic acid does so that's why I'm using tart and sour and my own mixture of citric acid watery stuff so basically I've got those three ingredients water sugar corn syrup in the pan I'm gonna turn that up to seven on my oven because I have numbers don't know the time sorry I could use my little thermometer to like read with my digital dot and be like here's the tip maybe I'll do that for you we'll see but unless you're using uh what are those things called an induction burner I don't see why it'd be helpful anyway if we're gonna heat them up and we're gonna get them to 295 degrees so let me start that process okay so we're just gonna start stirring this and as you can see it's pretty thick it's got like gloppy gloopy spots and it would be so much worse if there weren't water in there first and I'm sorry about the background noise I can't make candy and record videos with no sound in the background by myself really boring so I'm watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 go Harry Potter no we don't own the rights no I'm not selling anything no one's paying me to watch this it's just amazing background noise please don't sue me Warner Brothers just realized what I was going through the other ingredients that weren't sugar corn syrup and water I didn't give you any measurements I'm sorry I'm not stoned enough okay so chef Robert color oh my gosh she literally just need two drops two drops and it's supersaturated it'll work if you want it to look as pink as the stuff on this bottle add three drops it'll happen okay so three drops of that we're gonna use this whole DRAM a DRAM is such a weird measurements of liquid I think it's super old we just kept it but this DRAM flavor I'd normally use more but we're experimenting so we want to see if one DRAM have to actually flavor candy well enough um and as far as the tart and sour in the citric acid this is my version of a tablespoon it's pretty close to a tablespoon might be slightly larger than a tablespoon but I'm gonna do a tablespoon of each of the tart and sour and the citric acid so there's so much okay so the candy is boiling it actually started boiling while I was cleaning my machine uh-huh pay attention to your candy people don't let it boil without stirring it I'm lucky it didn't burn so this is gonna be like this for about 20 minutes we also have some other equipment we're gonna use we've got our digital probe thermometer we've talked about probe tips people get yourself one I'm not gonna say why you're not gonna mention how bad the other thermometers are just get yourself a probe tip the router over here we've got our Thomas Mills awesome Victorian candy roller here so fun I need to give it a little oily though we also have a marble pastry board and two stainless steel scrapers that's not all you're gonna need let's get to it oh trying something new um huh I think it's a joke but I'm gonna try it anyway these are essentially lotion gloves they're cotton gloves and if you put them on underneath a pair of blue nitro latex whatever loves it's supposed to defuse the heat and make it not so hot when you're mr. hot candy but I think this is going to be fully uh works works I'll be super stoked but yeah so I was ahh because the gloves underneath are for baby hands and I have large hands hmm they're only like up to here they're slipping sliding alright we're up to 265 degrees maybe to 95 so we probably have another 5 7 minutes to go I forgot to show you another piece of equipment darn it here you go this is an old-school boiler King hot plate thing and I had a Silpat over it this stage really was a little diffusing um it stays really hot and I put the hard candy on it to stay pliable while I am working in running it through the machine let's start this video now or you're not gonna get to see what I'm doing so pardon the fact that I'm not in a frame right now I'm still here with you have an abandon you I think that we're past 295 oh okay so I have all of my flavouring color citric acid all that good stuff in this bowl we're gonna dump it out and get all of it because it's precious and we're gonna stir it's gonna steam whoa it's gonna steam it's gonna keep steaming you're gonna keep with smells like water none we're gonna keep stirring until the steam goes away bye bye steam we don't want these days just add so I think it's all gone now and I'm going to pour this you're not gonna be able to see crap that better yeah I'm gonna pour this on to this surface here sorry you're a little out of frame but trimester on the Moulton candy and being the maker the filmer and everything it's not easy people it's not easy I'd rather not burn myself and sacrifice my body for a perfect shot I'm not one of those youtubers all right that's enough right put this in the sink what's that right you have our scrapers but I instantly start moving this around we don't want it I saw a dark spot I look nothing burns Oh that'd be bad let me close this so there's a better that's not better at all why so foggy in here all right now I did put more liquid in it that I normally do so there's a chance that this could be a little sticky I hope not I don't want to be sticky wants to be perfect and I cooked Italy longer than normal so maybe maybe that won't happen but we just continue to move it about until it's a little less liquid because I can't do much with it let's see if I can get a drizzle yeah I got one but you couldn't see it because oh there we go alright getting close to where it's getting sticky damn it I think this is gonna be a little sticky I'm gonna have to pull Andy pulling we can't be erase it and makes it more brittle we're just gonna cut whoa Wow that's stick into the glue that's not good all right cut this damn it off of my scraper get in my belly actually I need you to get on the warmer so get the hell off my scraper oh the hot mess okay this is why we're doing experiments all right we got the little ball we're gonna go put it on the warmer you stay on the water bowl as I fling pieces of hard candy everywhere oh my god oh my god this is so sticky look at it it's sticking my gloves this is bad you guys this what okay so the only good part about this oh my god is that ah the gloves do defuse the heat a little bit maybe you just need a new clothes let me get a new gloves news what might help maybe it was just a sticky spot all right we're gonna pull this yeah you know what these gloves really do work I am amazed because I mean don't stick to the glass all right and as you can see it's getting lighter with every pull I only put a couple drops of camp candy only put a couple drops the chef burger color in this one I didn't want it to be super pink okay this is watermelon and I'm gonna be making a strawberry I wanted the strawberry to be brighter more vivid and more red so you could tell the difference between the two I'm just gonna keep pulling this because I'm really enjoying it normally you can't pull candy this long burns a on my hands yeah yeah doctor friend I need to find a good position just put the camera so you guys can see the magic of it going through the machine Oh God this is pretty such a light pearly light pink at this point I've never been able to pull it this long alright I think it's getting firmer I need to stop pulling it and run it through the machine so let's move you to here I guess that's the best I can get for that and we're actually gonna cut this in half this is quite a large piece my foot all right beautiful while those are so pro lesson because of all the air that got pulled in there so pretty alright here's the second piece and this smells amazing I truly hope that I've gotten some kind of really sour candy honestly those right there are so pink they look like sobs has anyone had Zots I love them they're amazing though look at this fun mess normally you can hold yourself hand it over itself and over the candy and it'll come on it won't stick to itself but since I have such a wonderfully sticky recipe right now this is failing miserably Wow this sucks balls all right come on maybe if I just work it for a long time it'll do that yeah nope get off of there okay all right it's getting getting more cooperative now that was just a pain I guess with the sour candy I'm just gonna have to deal with the fact that there's huh but there's more liquid in it so it's gonna be stickier which sucks I don't want stick gonna go stop sticking with us cool boom boom stick I mean not trust I mean they pull right now no I'm kidding all right I actually really like these clothes I knocked the out of them before I even tried him and I apologize either amazing never what I thought lotion gloves would have made a difference they're just cotton and they're not even like we will get me some heat now oh okay right when I started to talk good about you I'll just start burning my skin oh yeah oh okay like I said no you won't listen to me okay all right I think it's getting less sticky and more firm so I need that what I need to cut this in half and roll this loverly piece let's see I kind of have a test to see if yeah it's good there we go there's another one then the last piece stick to the stuff that I'm sweating sweating a lot it's cold outside but for whatever reason I don't know why maybe it's better holding 300 degree candy I'm just all of a sudden really hot oh okay last one all right well flip you round whoo no there we go and if you look closely they say Madi on one side and boy on the other so I did it at the right time because you can't actually see the letters if it's too warm they kind of like room you can't really make them out so we have four pieces of what looked like really weird pink corn and I'm gonna pause so that I can get the next batch ready okay well I was lying the heat transfer was still very real look at my hands they're really red really warm so warm that but you know what it's worth it I love making candy oh Todd um and yeah I was gonna say something there was a reason I turned on the camera and I wasn't just to show you my hands oh excuse me I didn't drink kombucha that stuff was like like that but foamy uh-huh anyways um I uh I need to taste this before I make another batch of the same exact measurements I can't just like duplicate it and hope it worked out perfectly to know it does have quite a bit I'm just kidding um yeah so I don't know it's not cools and we're gonna taste it together I'm gonna feed you someone with a Karen you're gonna that's delicious at least I hope that's what you'll say so we'll be back here shortly okay I'm back sorry I had to login to this math class I'm taking online but doesn't have a great bandwidth or anything and it let's just not get started on that it's crap um here comes the fun part of the candy making not just the tasting but the breaking so there every time I do this since I don't have a backing on my table I end up getting candy all over the floor so I'm gonna try my hardest not to break candy all over the floor and I'm gonna hold this for you Wow I am breaking it so here we turn you around you pick this up and that wasn't very satisfying I'm scared there we go let's break another one they got to do it from high from up high but I just I don't want to break it all over my counter how about this there we go that was pretty good so you can just throw them around like that or you can  there goes the piece on the floor and another piece over there uh I need some a table with some something some edges so we're gonna break a couple of these alright and I'm gonna mmm-hmm excuse me I'm gonna try one I like to try pieces that are broken so that if I they turn out good and I want to sell them another I sell any candy no one's letting anything renew I can use those so here we go super pulled super extra sour stuff it is a little tacky to the touch which is not good but let's see okay whew not good that's right I'm trying to bite into it see her sour on the inside sorry here we go I think you're trying to phase a smidge but I'm a really big sour fan so how do you think it's not like warhead levels me isn't super sour but I tell you this was a good good recipe there take any spirit out to taste bad I tasted delicious I'm trying not to eat a lot of candy that game like 10 pounds do this quarantine crap so don't take it the wrong way I love my candy it was delicious so here's a nice pile of it I need to break the rest of it up and put it in packages Oh someone's calling me up everybody okay so I really wanted to make a second batch of candy but the weather has taken quite a shift it went from being like overcast and crappy to 80 plus degrees it was really hot and I don't feel like sweating my balls off under their balls but making more candy so we're just gonna take one more hit of this bowl with you whatever fed you candy hold on here you go mmm lick lick so tasty glad you got to try some if you know me and you're watching this video hit me up I'll give you some for free obviously if you're on the state shipping that's gonna cost you some money because money I broke all I can afford is weed candy all right guys I'm blathering on I just want to make a video because I missed you I don't think about making paydays I have to make some new goat which is a pain in the butt but it's doable so maybe I'll do that let me know in the comments whatever if you want me to make something specific if you want to subscribe right on if you don't right on if you want to follow me cool if not cool I'm not pressuring anybody I appreciate all the likes and all the comments and all the followers regardless of how I got them that sounded wrong okay we're gonna end it on that note have a good day", "vm6lR4ZFaZM": "been unsuccessful you know I'm talking to hey I got two viewers already one like this went on and went away I guess I'm not like hello hello this is Greg had lofty pursuits where we make hard candy Jessica is making a batch and I'm videotaping it so we're gonna see here we've already poured the hot sugar we're making strawberry so please remember that and tell everyone else who logs on and that's what we're making and we got the taffy machine going somebody just said this is the best thing to wake up to in the morning what yeah it's a stretching machine we can do it on the hook with the larger batches like this it easier to do on the machine and the number of poles you have to do depends on how long you can pull it and I'm afraid that one garden Jessica I keep on suggesting when we get a rack and she keeps on talking about me part contacting OSHA the ribs here watching us make candy my folks you can wave [Music] so we pulled the yellow background for the strawberry no it's hard candy w.b.t East X guys you gotta have nicer handles than this or I can't read them online so is this coming across okay did you hear me okay we make great part candy we're actually going to do a video on grape hard candy sometime soon and reintroduce it you just heard somebody listening to me on a video on a livestream on a video it's extremely meta so here we go jessica is now making a yellow triangle a bunch of them actually this will be leapfrog for the top of a strawberry I bet you guys didn't know it was called the Frog at the top now did it I made that up no it's called the sprout I'm just we still do nectar candy there are patterns in the candy of there will be there isn't yet so this green is going to be the green top to the strawberry [Music] hello Bianca welcome here from Australia we have some people here from Melbourne Melbourne Florida how long will I be streaming I suspect until either my battery runs out or I run out of Meg's of our gigs of upload bandwidth I've been told that since I have t-mobile t-mobile will give me binge watching for uploads - because it doesn't know the difference so we're actually testing this today if I have any bandulus levant when I'm done with this for the rest of the month I'll be a little surprised but I'll be happy it is strawberry-flavored yes just like that strawberry emoticon lick your screen check it out I've seen Willy Wonka guy in London I don't care what you say the London is not as hot and sticky as Tallahassee just because you don't have air-conditioning hi Debra we're in Brooklyn are you from if you could teleport not only could you be here but I tell you what I needed you to pick up on the way this is interesting when you have 370 s Watchers right now so that over there is the fron at the top of the strawberry this over here is the background color jessica is probably making the center of the strawberry berries or seeds would you want to put a hairnet on that hair it would be destroying fine art it's a hard question whether there's a cooling time difference between fold and unfold candy when you pull the candy you bring in air so it's colder to begin with no matter what you do Wyatt the Gryffindor why don't we sell unicorn droppings online because this is our current stock of unicorn droppings they sell out locally faster than we do these shelves are bare because too many of you came to visit and bought our unicorn droppings we don't make a lot of them and they sell too fast they're also annoying to ship they don't fit in the boxes our website is www.miamikettlebell.com they're named correctly so just because now I'm making each little seed of the strawberry individually and she's using candy multiplication and here's somebody who just bought a unicorn dropping and a thinks of generic silly putty that's really cool silly putty can be sawed off your play it at home kit I know it's dangerous but we perform without a net I hope your ancestor who is executed in the Salem witch trials as he just posted was executed after he had children not before we're making strawberry image candy right now Jessica is building the strawberry we've done plenty of live streams I just don't tend to put them up for public view after this live stream is over welcome to lofty pursuits where we make hard candy if you're not aware you

assembly Jarrad there is no way to get a uniform temple like that so here it goes getting rapped at it's yellow blanket of goodness this is Greg there behind the camera and Jessica's in front of the camera please check out our web site at www.movinon.com [Music] sometimes you want the candy sticky so while she's working on the outter app she's throwing it on our batch roller to keep it moving this machine's cast-iron weighs about 500 pounds judging from having to have lifted this with about six other people and with me it's somewhere between 1895 and 1910 oh it will twist it it just doesn't matter at this point so this is going to be the outer wrap Patrick of course we make government candy check out our website WWE do I just got back from my trip today from visiting Hercules candies and I haven't had a chance to even look at the footage hopefully I'll get enough to put it down PD stands for public displays a confection of course we do International shipping I have not done a live stream for Towell day here goes Jessica making it work but you might want that you push in that little hole yo hole or you fix it already [Music] I'll give you a tour of the store after this how do we look just because I'm loud and obnoxious doesn't mean that all my employees are some of them are quiet severe in taste and then there's justice so what she's doing now is she's scaling it down you cut off the next piece can you hold it up to the end up to the camera show us what the edge looks like can you see that folks yeah it's a strawberry out-of-focus strawberry but there we go can you see that good she's got to put it down in the some candy it's not gonna work out it's got to be kept moving see we already got a little bunching going on there we go now we got a video of somebody videoing us video candy tastes better when it's meta can you repeat your question about two hours from starting the path to finishing a batch maybe a little bit more the banana video you said the banana candies to die for what about our dice flavor candy we have made candy in the shape of dice within candy that looks like dice we're to die for not bananas that's not that's confusing [Music] probably not gonna make the tide pot candy again that jokes been done I also got a very polite phone call from the head of consumer safety of Procter & Gamble Mike was a very nice guy I'm not making any more right now because he asked me so nicely he didn't even threaten or anything who came to us very simple agreement I was reading a candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison that looked like a candy that was really how the conversation what now anyone out here have any questions because you probably mirror the questions of the people online we're streaming right now by the way you can take up to 18 months to get fully mastered maybe a little bit more Jessica's been here since October and she's just about got letters going and she's possibly my fastest student ever so you know it really takes a good few months before you can even solo so it takes a very long marg commitment and time and labor by the way I am planning on making vial of candy sometime soon I got some sample flavors to test so how are you doing you came here your your your mom asked if I was we're gonna make candy today and we are and you may end up on the video do you think that's cool [Music] I'll be injecting on pull you got a picture of her peach candy up there it's good candy it tastes fuzzy it does Jessica should use anything to say Jessica there you go thank you Steinberg I

in the North America of course we ship to Canada is Rose flavor yes we make Rose candy that's rose flavors which means it's either going to be one of the most delicious things you ever tasted or it's going to taste like your grandmother's soap it all depends on how you were raised and weirdly uh we could go tomorrow I was at Hercules candy the cane sugar thing is fully shot it's a real pain to edit apparently the Alexa thing worked I've always wondered it would the necessities look like pretzels for toppings and egg creams and possibly the bag looked like it got watch McCall at cartridges for the whipped cream container we shift to Northern Ireland you may be right it's that hair attached to you like permanently oh okay I was just wondering do you have any food you can get Jessica's

at Hercules candy those guys are great ok folks it's time to take it bye bye Jessica", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "FYsqZXHVnI8": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida where we make hard candy today we're gonna make some crystal flour candy this time in the shape of a sunflower this batches flavor will be honey this was made originally as a custom order for a wedding but we like the results so much we thought we'd show you it and start making it at lofty pursuits for a little while [Music] the table were pouring the hot sugar on is a special table from the late 1800s it was made specifically for this and we're going to be stirring in our food coloring and adding it we're gonna do this before the table cools the candy down to the point we needed to we needed to behave like a clay not like a liquid we use small wooden spoons to stir in the food coloring and let the water boil off that's in the food coloring this keeps the candy from getting sticky our color pellet today will have three colors brown yellow and green this is a part of our crystal candy series that we started earlier this year [Music] none of the candy is cooled a bit we're gonna cut the colors apart and then fold them on the cooling table to even out the temperature within each piece [Music] sunflowers are fascinating plants and they have attracted the attention of everyone from painters like Van Gogh to scientists one of the reasons I think people like them is they all face the same way in a field it's not one sunflower it's a bunch of them that are amazing and they all face the same way because they are Gila tropic this means they follow the Sun so as they turn to the Sun they all turn in time with each other to like a slow dance of flowers and their petals all open up and they're out they are looking at you sort of like faces and this is one of the things that make them cool and we're gonna try to capture this in our candy and now it's time for me to use the candy makers hook on this I'm gonna take the yellow candy fold it over and pull it again and again to trap air bubbles this is gonna change the nature of the candy it's gonna change its texture and increase its surface area with these little air bubbles this makes it taste better when you eat the candy it's also going to make the color brighter and while it doesn't appear so on this video yet the brightening happens after the candy cools off it's more noticeable the color change when I pulled the brown sugar because I'm going to need to Center the little seeds to be lighter than the outside and when I pull that you'll be able to see its color change as I pull I [Music] mentioned earlier that I needed some green candy too and I haven't made me yet I'm gonna make it on the heating table you see I need such a tiny amount of green if I try to make it on the cooling table the color would spread and I'd end up with more green than I could use so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a little bit of a hot clear candy and add just a drop of green food coloring in it I've done this too a pocket inside the candy and I'm going to fold that over again and again with the pocket sealed and it's gonna sculler this candy besides the sunflower being the only flower that has the name flower in its name it also has other peculiar characteristics it's actually not one flower but a group of flowers if you think of it each flower only makes one seed and a sunflower has a Fibonacci sequence of a spiral of seeds in it when it's done and we end up having multiple seeds in each seed as a flower and those are tiny flowers in the center of the head of the sunflower the yellow petals we think of as the petals of the sunflower are called rays and each of them are a special type of flower in themselves multiple flowers on the flower head I'm making the center of the flower out of a group of cylinders the center of the cylinder is pulled lighter Brown candy and the outside wrap is a dark brown candy the nice thing about candy is I can do multiplication with it in other words I'm going to pull one long log out and cut it in half and keep on pulling it and cutting it it'll get thinner but it'll make all the cylinders that I need and they'll all be roughly the same size [Music] and now to make the raise around the head of the sunflower I'm gonna do this by making one large block of yellow gonna put some clear on one side that's gonna act as a spacer to differentiate the different petals then we're going to take two cold triangles of clear and they're gonna shape the top of the petals as best as I can now I'm only going to make one giant petal and then I'm gonna stretch it and cut it in half and then I'll have two and I'm gonna continue to repeat this until I have enough to wrap around our seeds [Music] you can try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.ppsd.com flowers are native to North America there are two varieties native to South America and because of that it's become the state flower of Kansas but it's been exported and it grows beautifully in some other countries it's actually the national flower of the Ukraine and the Ukraine over there grows more sunflowers and produces more sunflower oil than any other country in the world [Music] all the fluff to do is put on the final wrap but it went into the final wrap I make a clean square edge and I add my green so when I roll it up will have a stem on our sunflower I know I took some liberties here with the brown sunflower seeds real sunflower seeds are black if they're used for oil and blocking gray striped if they're used for eating but gray doesn't show up well in candy and I thought the brown would look better and now to our new piece of equipment to Thomas Mills batch roller well it's new to us they started making this model around 1895 I've got a catalog page from an old catalog from before it and when I found that I was very happy it has been able to do what it was advertised to do back in the late 1800s increased my productivity we can now make more candy with the same number of people and what it does is it rolls the candy it does the job that I used to do there is some templates I have located under those mats I used to protect my table feel carefully you'll see that we're getting ready for candy cane season and those are templates for making candy canes we're not going to be using those today now we have to pull the log of candy into Roth's and I've been calling them rods but the industry term for them is canes this term was borrowed from the glass industry where canes a glass were pulled and cut into beads using a similar technique called Miller Flores I want to take this time to apologize to you for not putting on a video lately we've been very busy making candy and we've been doing a lot of work preparing for a Kickstarter campaign which is now over and was quite successful we're gonna be traveling around the country to shoot some really cool candy making videos for you and if you didn't know about the Kickstarter campaign and want to find out what we're gonna do just go to Kickstarter and check us out I want to personally thank you for all the unbelievable support through that Kickstarter campaign we're gonna be able to do things I never thought we could afford to do thank you so much [Music] the last step of the process is to cut it into pieces and then we can go for the quality control check fortunately I have a group of people here who are happy to volunteer to be my quality control checkers [Music] I think this may be the first time that when somebody saw my candy up close they were actively unsure if they should eat it or just save it as a piece of art [Music] we appreciate you watching our video today if you liked our candy and want to try it for yourself you can go to our website www.youtube.com and Twitter too and if you ever come to Tallahassee we'd love to see you in person we call our candy public displays the confection because we do it in front of the public and you can come ballet we don't make candy all the time but we do make a lot of it and you can see us make candy in Tallahassee thank you for watching you", "U3IdxTpVE04": "hey guys today I have something a little bit different how about some old-fashioned hard candy not only made the old-fashioned way but with chili peppers hey guys how's it going to spill more back again with another hot and spicy product to review for you guys know today I have something a little bit different just like I said in the intro I have some old-fashioned hard candy made the old-fashioned way and made with chili peppers these were sent to me I've got three of them to review today these were sent to me from the chess pros handmade confections I believe I'm seeing that right chess Bros handmade confections are located I'm not too far up the road from where I live in Thomasville North Carolina let me go ahead and read what it says on their website it says we trace our candy making routes all the way back to the Davis candy company located in 1910 in Springfield Missouri the business has changed hands and names several times over the years but one thing remains constant our commitment to making quality products for our customers I thought this was really cool it says we still use most of the original candy making equipment today copper pots gas stoves wooden paddles and vintage turn-of-the-century candy making equipment you can taste the difference that quality makes now you can check them out at chess bros confections dot-com I'll put that link down in the description and they've got a fantastic website guys they not only have these old-fashioned hot candies I'll be reviewing they're three spicy ones they've got other flavors as well they've got soft candies they've got Brittles which look amazing fudge dip mixes desert mixes snack mixes gift items they've got fruit slices just a some awesome looking products so let's go ahead and get into these guys this one's the first one I'm not gonna sit here and eat these for you here on this video review but I've tried them several times they're mango habanero just look at that these come in four and a half ounce size packs but very large pieces of hard candy probably at least thirty in here this has a very very delicious mango habanero flavor it's the mildest of the three not much heat from this one at all but a really nice delicious fruity mango type flavors what you're getting from from this one I think this would be for everybody it's really not that spicy I'd probably put the heat on my one to ten scale at about a 1 out of 10 but very very delicious so this is their mango habanero if you like that combination if you especially if you love mango and fruit and you love hard candies I definitely recommend this one now this one is delicious guys this is moving up in the heat department a little bit this is their whoops their orange ghost chili hot candy look at that dragon on there and now this has a nice sweet and sour blood orange type base to it I think this is the favorite of three this has a little bit more heat coming from the Ghost Pepper so you definitely can tell that it's got more heat than the mango habanero it just kind of fills your mouth all over with with a very very to me low level ghost pepper type burn but super super delicious blood orange flavor to this one with a little more heat I'd probably put this one maybe at a 3 out of 10 oh my one to 10 scale it's kind of hard to give heat ratings for candies it's so subjective but I'm just trying to give you an example of how I would rate them for heat so maybe that will help you and then this one here guys this is their hottest one this is the one made with Carolina Reaper now if you love cinnamon type candy if you love Hot Tamales or if you love a those fireballs you're probably going to really love this one so it's got a nice cinnamon spicy flavor to it this is the hottest of the three and I think it's probably seems a lot hotter than maybe you what it is because of the cinnamon I think cinnamon candies sometimes come across as being a little bit more spicy but you could definitely tell that because of the Carolina Reapers it are in here this is spiced up probably to about a 5 out of 10 on my one to ten scale the longer you keep it in the mouth you got to give these time as you suck on them and keep them in your mouth you've got to let it dissolve a little bit and then you can start getting more of the flavor you could start getting feeling more of the heat to sum this one they may want to take this out of their mouth for a while and put it down and maybe get something to drink it may reach that level to some but it does you know heat the mouth up pretty good with that nice awesome fiery cinnamon flavor so about a five out of ten for heat on my window ten scale but great candies highly recommended once again this is the Carolina Reaper hot candy I think the favorite to want to really enjoy the most is this one this is the orange ghost chili hot candy I really loved that blood orange base and then the very mildest of all of them once again is the mango habanero hot candy so thank Texas Company out guys once again the chess pros confections calm link will be

"welcome to the sugar Test Kitchen guys we're an all natural vegan candy company based in our bure to Canada this is our new YouTube channel to show you guys how we make our candies here at sugar today we're making mango passion fruit hard candies that are colored with turmeric and flavored with natural oils at this stage the sugar has already been colored and flavored now that I've tested the sugar for heat and consistency I'm adding a mixture of citric and malic acid with our acid candies tastes like nothing it would just be like eating a lump of sugar and nobody wants to do that if you're gonna eat candy you want it to taste amazing now I'm incorporating the acid into the candies by folding it and kneading it like bread this is the process to make every candy taste the same so you don't have a lump of acid in one that makes it really sour and not in another [Music] now that the acids been incorporated it's time to split the sugar into two [Music] because we don't use any titanium dioxide in our candies which would make them white and opaque we have to pull the sugar this process aerates the candy trapping air bubbles inside which reflect light this causes the candy to appear lighter and more opaque the pulling of the sugar also gives the finished candies a better mouthfeel [Music] see the difference pulling can make to the same sugar [Music] now I'm gonna roll each piece of sugar into a log and cut it into three pieces of varying sizes this is going to help me create this concentric circle design later on [Music] time to flatten each piece [Music] now for the fun part creating the pattern that will go into the candies because mango passionfruit is a more grown-up flavor I chose a subtle concentric circle design for these candies don't worry the crazy patterns are coming soon each piece of sugar is wrapped in a slightly larger piece of sugar of the alternating color to create this design [Music] the design is finished and now I have to keep the candy round until it reaches the perfect temperature so I can pull it and make it into smaller rods [Music] as you can see here I'm tapering down the end of this big blob of sugar so I can pull it into rods that will eventually become individual candies [Music] these rods have to be rolled pretty much continuously until they Harden and cooled down otherwise they're gonna go flat and misshapen and a little stick together [Music] this is where I get to see if all my hard works paid off I get to see if the design of the candies worked sometimes it goes really wrong and it gets to try the candy and see if it tastes good which also sometimes can go really wrong you guys don't get to try those ones but that's the fun of the Test Kitchen I also get to play with a really big knife and a really heavy envel so yeah this is one of my favorite parts of the can't be making process [Music] these candies turned out exactly how I wanted them they tasted amazing the pattern was really subtle and caulis a success I think these are definitely going to be made in the commercial kitchen and ready to sell to you guys make sure to check our web store it's updated every Sunday with our new candies and will be coming up with new videos very often and very soon this was really fun bye guys", "HmClCY2OJS0": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I thought today since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "6fC-r0BE9f0": "[Music] [Music]

water let's see how much water we let put in here probably about quarter of a cup Mason cup just enough to just enough to wet put on a heat put on high heat I'm doing that take a little little bit a little bit of margarine melt it in the microwave i melted my butter a little bit and I'm going to add here ambulant peppermint candies so Patrick have an oil this is oil apparently extremely strong but you have to mix it with the oil consensuses oil it has to mix with another oil now maybe a make them really strong I don't want to eat too many of them yeah maybe a quarter of a teaspoon to a half a teaspoon of pure peppermint oil not extract not extract this is oil mix it up with this Manas potent very potent not going to touch with my video either cuz the burned don't touch us to your face or anything else pure peppermint oil is deadly undead Lee but also if you mix peppermint oil with water in the summer and spray it on yourself very small amount of peppermint oil and put it in the spray mosquitoes hate it okay this will come to a boil culprit cavity beetles got a little green we'll just add and it's boiling now just add a little bit of green so I can distinguish this from my cinnamon candy that I already made otherwise they come out clear boiling four minutes keep it on high you don't just stir it all the time that's a silicon spatula silicon spatulas could withstand high heat don't use a regular rubber spatula it'll melt it for sure but this is silicone so it's okay when it makes a thread let's start make a thread already maybe it's three minutes I cook it at them see how many way have to when you put a blip over here see if it gets hard this is parchment paper so it doesn't stick oh yeah I'm going to put the parchment paper over here on the stove I don't know about that using my granite countertops I don't know how much heat that can stand up now that's just a little soft ball right now it's not it's just tacky sticky gotta go the full four minutes keep it on high a little drop there see what happens not quite it's usually four to six minutes at a taster on high heat you don't want it turn brown it's brown it's no good almost like a thread take one more time try it get them sticky to hear which is good move threads get into get just about ready yep I can feel it's getting tacky hear someone turn it off and add my peppermint blow up in your face green spread immediately on the parchment paper spread out a little bit make a little fin cuz they'll crack and they get hard they'll just crack don't touch it with your fingers it will burn your skin right off yep that's it getting hard to how it's hard gets hard just to show you how hard it's going to get now those are nice and spread out and women those break when we break them up they're going to be

say last but not least and definitely not the last one but in this series of candy making using chocolate I'm making my own favorite chocolate which is chocolate nougat these candies are a first time for me as well so join me I'll be using a Barney got chocolate and this chocolate is fresh from the fridge so it's really really stiff you can hear that but I won't be using it as is I'll be taking advantage of the fact that still summer around here and I'll take advantage of that and allow them my chocolate to warm to room temperature around 35 degrees Celsius you can see what it did to it it's really really good in candy making because you want your canned ingredients to be warm otherwise they will steal too much heat from the candy which means in this case your candy will be hardened too fast so let's make some candies and see how it goes our candy has reached the right temperature of a 150 degree Celsius 300 degrees Fahrenheit nice and clear I'll are the chocolate new books mixer and quite curious to see how it works yep think it's ready that's for my call chocolates is getting hard really fast yep it's hard already and use that nice Oh got most of it let's cut it before it's too late [Music] according to the aroma here the flavor should be really really intense so I cut this into small squares let's see how they do I let it cool off I'll see you in a minute okay our candies is cool this is definitely rigid or a bit but still not too hot to hold [Music] well that's it I'll try this one oh there Huntley that's definitely chocolate Nouveau my favorite of flavor hope you enjoy this thanks for watching see you soon guys", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "CKcE0Nxd0gg": "welcome to lofty pursuits in Tallahassee\nFlorida where we make hard candy but lofty pursuits is also a soda fountain\nand sometimes we travel around the country to visit other soda fountains\nand to learn about their regional delicacies today we're going to do\nsomething fun we're gonna take a regional delicacy a\nlime sour from the Atlanta region and we're going to turn it into candy to do\nthis we're gonna go to a Chapman's Drugs a pharmacy that's been around for almost\na hundred years that's just south of Atlanta but just north of the Atlanta\nRegional Airport we're also gonna find out why sour drinks like lime aids\nlemonade's or even a coke quench your thirst so well we think a sodas now is\nthis thing that comes out of a machine a can or a bottle but back when chapman's\nwas founded in the 20s you'd go to a soda fountain to get a drink because you\ncouldn't get the can of the bottle or you would get it because you were\ngetting medicine that was in liquid form and the liquid form tasted so bad he\nwanted it to be mixed up with something so you could drink it because it would\ntaste good Chapman still has its original mahogany and marble soda\nfountain it's beautiful it's been maintained wonderfully and they still\nuse it on a daily basis and I was there after school and was pretty cool to see\nthe kids rush in after school to get their treats they bought sodas they\nbought candy and they bought ice cream and soda fountain treats what they are\nknown for is a drink called the lime sour this is a drink that's made with\nshaved ice lime juice salt Sawada and salt if you'll notice there's no sugar\nin there and that's okay because this is meant to refresh and you get a sweet\ntaste anyway and I'll explain why a little later Anna works the soda\nfountain here at Chapman's drugs and she was nice enough to show us how to make\nthe lime sour optional virgins have a straight so this\ndrink and the salt are treat if you'll notice there was no sugar that went into\nthis this is just lime juice ice and seltzer water and it makes you feel\ncooler in the summer and that's because of the acid in the lime you see when\nyou're thirsty in the summer your mouth is dry and the high levels of acid in a\nlime drink or high acid drink makes your mouth salivate and that elevation makes\nyou seem instantly refreshed even though this drink is extremely sour and you can\ncounter the sour with some salt it's gonna make you feel cooler because now\nyour mouth isn't going to feel dry anymore and this is the trick of\nlemonade lime aid and the lime Rickey which is a fruit drink with a lime that\ngets an asset to it now if you also take a look at the phosphates now phosphates\nare common in soda fountains in the past you'd have a chocolate phosphate other\nphosphates it used the acid because the sugar in\nthe drink need your mouths dry out so it wasn't as refreshing so they pumped up\nthe acid level in the drink to give you a wet mouthfeel and then they pumped up\nmore sugar to counter the acid taste there's only one common phosphate around\nthat's Coca Cola if you look it still uses the phosphor the phosphoric acid in\nit and because of that it has a huge amount of sugar in it but it also no one\ntalks about has a huge amount of acid coca cola has about as much acid in it\nas standard vinegar does and that's because it needs that acid to make the\ndrink seem refreshing but here we can do it just with crushed ice lime juice a\nlittle salt and it's refreshing in hot weather and then it's strange even without sugar\nthe drink it becomes sweet Derrick Chapman the fourth-generation owner of\nChapman drugs tells us about it life's hours are sweet at some point so\nit's got so much salt in it about half way through the salt kind of disappeared\nit overwhelmed your mouth or something and it's almost just a sweet taste the\nlime sour just it's either a lover or hate so you'll find people that in the\nover 90 years they've been in hateful Georgia some things have stayed the same\nlike the soda fountain but the ice has not they used to have the ice delivered\nby the train that runs across the street seemingly on a daily basis Wow it is so\nthey would chop the blocks press the ice if you ever get a chance to visit\nChapman's pharmacy it's in hape Ville Georgia just south of Atlanta between\ni-75 and i-85 in a little wedge and there's more to see there too the dwarf\nhouse was here and that became chick-fil-a and they still operate on\nthe original location I guess this leaves the question how do\nwe get from a drink to hard candy and what we're going to do is we're going to\nuse it as their inspiration to capture the essence of the strength in hard\ncandy we've already heated the sugar to 310\ndegrees and we've already added the lime oil which is the flavoring for this\ncandy and now we're going to pour it on our candy cooling table to get it down\nto temperature the next step is we make it green with food coloring and we stir\nit in with our little wooden spoons and you'll see it boils so that's boiling\noff the water because the water is bad for candy it makes it sticky now for the\nmagic to take place first we add the citric acid this creates the sour we\nnext add baking soda now when the water in your mouth comes in contact with the\nbass King soda and the citric acid it will fizz and this will carbonate the\ncandy in your mouth so you'll get the soda sensation and lastly we're putting\nin salt that if I do it right will give you a salt finish on the flavor just\nlike a lime sour since the sugars been sitting on the\ncandy cooling table without moving it's uneven in temperature the top is hot the\nbottom is cool and we're gonna fold it and mix it all together usually when I'm\ndoing drops I mix the colorant in the pot but here I'm doing it on the table\nbecause I know I'm gonna have to pull this on the hook or the citric acid and\nthe baking soda isn't gonna blend evenly I'll blend all the color on the hook too\nif you'd like to try this candy for yourself you can order it at\nwww.pd.net we're making it sour with citric acid\nand we're adding baking soda but not enough to cancel out all of the sour to\ncreate carbonation in your mouth and then for a finish we're adding salt and\nthe salt is going to give you the same sensation sort of like you get for a\nmargarita we're gonna use this little press to make the candy into drops\nlittle round balls of sugar and sweetness and sour and salt and we're\ngonna do this just by running it through the press it's actually a lot harder\nthan it looks but I can't really explain why this press was originally made in\n1871 and was owned by John Mulaney company a candy company in Cincinnati\nthat was well known for their sweets all that's left is to separate these sheets\nof candy into individual pieces and you'll understand in a moment why they\ncall them drops thank you for watching we really do appreciate it and if you\nwant to get some of

channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you

everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "oJKnXFcpcUI": "tis I miss cannabis puree with more reviews for you today and today I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to see more just subscribe to my page please maybe like the videos let me know you're watching say something

paced the second one it's much faster paced if you like your films the based and still scary that was the thing with the original one he's very scary because it's just so creepy no way your honor on a

please like this video if you liked it please subscribe to my channel with you haven't already sorry my belly's rumbling I'm gonna go off now come on down watch alien brilliant movie aliens having dark eyes have yourselves a wonderful peaceful", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "Qbd3v4ZtBog": "hello so i'm really excited for tonight's video because um the last time i did a video where i just did a whisper ramble and had a butterscotch candy in my mouth you guys really seemed to enjoy it so i'm back with some more butterscotch candies and i love butterscotch so much so i'm really excited they're like one of my favorite hard candies so it's hammond's butterscotch and there's just some little one two three four five six butterscotch candies on the front and i'm really excited to dig into them so i have a couple right in front of me to use throughout the video and i didn't really think about what i was going to say i have no idea what i'm going to talk about but i think that makes it more exciting so let's open this a little farther away from the mic i don't want it to be too loud okay so we just got this little butterscotch candy okay delicious so i think the last video i did like this i was talking about my new year's resolutions and um i don't know what i want to talk about i will say um i'm really excited about this year because i want to take more time to go camping and stuff and just spend more time outside than i did last year i'm gonna move the camera a little bit um i was inside all year like literally all year i went outside to go running sometimes but that was when no one when i went outside and then everyone started running and going on trails and my city closed off all the trails because they were getting really busy which makes sense you know and then i was just kind of back inside again and my little dog um i've showed him before in my channel but he's just a little tiny he's like a york game on these and he actually has cancer he's like 11 years old and he pulled a muscle in his knee and he actually got surgery in the middle of last year like in the middle of quarantine and so we've been kind of taking it easy with him he's got arthritis he's like a trooper okay but he doesn't act like he has any of those things he's like an old guy in a teenager's body or something i swear and um my boyfriend and i are staying at my parents house while they're gone and so we're like watching the dog in the house and everything and they left us one of their cars and we've been using it to take my dog on little adventures um so we recently just went to i went on a camping trip we just got back um we went on like a five mile hike the second day that we were there and that's like the longest walk that my dog has been on in like a long time because it's been like i guess like six months now that he's gotten out of his surgery for his knee and um you know we were only allowed to take him on like five minutes at a time and so now he's like in the clear for months now but we didn't know how he was gonna do and he was making us look bad because he was more in shape than like we were which you know made me really happy not for my physical fitness but for my dog he's doing so good and he's so happy and i think it was like really invigorating and exciting for him to be in a new environment and not go on this team you know routine walk as he's gone on for years you know because we have a few trails over here but they've been closed and so we kind of just go around the neighborhood in different areas but he has everything memorized he knows where everything is it's not um as exciting for him you know what i mean and so one part that made me really nervous on this hike was there was a sign that warned that for the next mile and a half it was gonna be very steep and i was thinking oh no you know one because i'm out of shape but do because my dog like is too scared to go up and down the stairs by himself so i didn't really know how he was gonna fare going up a mile and a half on a steep cliff that he's never seen before so i was getting really nervous and then um this little guy we reached the very beginning okay and um it's literally like you cannot see the top it's just so steep and like a little mountain goat this tiny 12-pound dog just goes like up the top of this thing and we're just standing at the bottom like what what this 11 year old dog i just got out of knee surgery has arthritis as lymphoma and like hasn't gone up the stairs in years just went up this cliff like it was nothing and i'm like he's going so much faster than me that i'm actually holding him back because i'm holding the leash and i have to speed up this ill clever rocky thing and i'm like holding him back but anyways we were stunned like we did not see that coming at all you know so we're really excited because we like going backpacking and we haven't gone um in a really long time i think it's been a few months now and we have the car for a couple months so we're thinking of going on more camping and backpacking trips but we also were watching the dog and we didn't want him to do like anything that he was not you know like anything out of his comfort zone and so when we got back from our camping trip we thought that he was just gonna be like sore and tired and just like completely you know just no energy tired for the rest of the day and um he was doing that thing where he was whimpering at the door and at his leash so that we could take him out again and ever since we've been like going on walks after that he's been more adventurous and like jumping up on these rocks because he's very tiny so he can't really see and um one of the areas that we walk by has a bunch of rocks lining the sidewalk um and there's like trees on the other side and so there's a bunch of squirrels running around there and usually he stops at the rocks because he can't see past them and so if a squirrel runs across and goes up the tree it doesn't even bother right but now he jumps on the rocks and jumps over the rocks and is like running up to the trees and like i don't know we're just so much more excited about everything um and it makes me happy that he's so excited but it makes me sad that i didn't do this for him earlier you know what i mean but um i didn't know that he was going to be so good um or like so energetic and athletic um but yeah so i'm just really excited that he's gonna be going with us on outdoorsy things um and the fact that he was so ready to do it like everything all over again the next day and day after the day after we're probably going to take him like primitive camping with us so you know like backpacking um but we're still going to do a few like car camping where you like drive up to the side and pitch it in and you don't like hike to your spot or anything um just for a while to get him used to everything um plus i want to groom him because his hair is really long right now and um you know he gets those little like stickers and things stuck in his fur and they get matted up so i want to kind of get his hair cut a little bit so that um it won't get like matted in his hair and stuff when we go um i'm going to start hiking to our spot so so yeah i'll put another candy wow i just ranted about my dog for like 13 minutes it's so hard not to he's so cute and he's kind of at that age where he has really weird eating habits so he'll only eat if you tell him not to it's weird we've tried to figure out other ways to get him to eat but it's like a game for him um and you know you have his food in his bowl and he'll actually go up to his bowl and whimper and whimper and he will not eat it until you say no no no and then he'll start like his tail will start whacking and he starts you know doing a little bit of growling and then i'll start eating it and then i'll look up at you and kind of have that expecting look on his face and then you say no and then i'll growl and it'll start eating if anyone knows why he does that and like if it's a game or if your dog does that but it's like fun for him because he'll whimper until you do it i don't know or um if i set food out on the floor and like a trail and i like leave a trail of his food like around in a circle i'll just start he won't start until you tell him no and then he'll start eating it and then go around and eat the trail of food that you left i have no idea but he's a little goofy but he's very adorable and i guess it's just going to be a video about me talking about my dog but when i was in high school i went on this camping trip and i got really bad mosquito bites like everywhere and there was one in the middle of my back that i couldn't reach and i taught my dog how to scratch my back i'm not even kidding so i just held a treat behind me like this and i kept saying scratch scratch and so he would go and he knows back so if you go like this i'll do this you know um so i kind of it was kind of that same idea but i just had him do it until he went like this and scratched my back so i'd be like a scratch and he knows to do this but now i don't really have him scratch my back you know i actually never have him scratch my back but do any of you also have like a sequence of tricks that you um do with your dog if you have one um like you do them in a certain order because we do sit pop which is like shake down roll over and then bag and then scratch but we'll have them like scratch our leg or something um and then speak and oh this is another thing that i taught my dog um so we got him when i have no idea what grade i was in but i took french in middle school and um my professor my professor my teacher would always say like just like listen and repeat i don't know why i did this but i would tell my dog like echo day and i would also treat up and that means like i'm about to throw it like a fetch but i don't know like echo day i know the treat up and he get ready he's going oh my gosh she's gonna throw it and then everybody eat it and throw it and then you like oh i try to catch it but i don't know why i did that so it's really funny now watching people do it because i was just a dumbass and i was like echo day day and now it's like a thing and we tell him to scratch i i don't i don't know why i did any of that but it's really funny like watching my boyfriend do it because he's like echo day every day and my dog is like ready and then i don't know it's just so funny watching people do it because like like what was i thinking and then i also um so before i would go to school um like i wrote the bus in like middle school and high school and it always made me really sad that my dog would be like home alone while we were gone um so i liked to hide a treat in his bed i would give him one i would hide a treat in his bed and then i would go up to him and he would always wait by the window for me and i would give him the treat and then i would be really excited for him to find the treat later on because he would eventually get bored at the window and just go lay down in his bed and so now whenever i give him a treat he goes in his bed to find the other one because he eventually learned that there will always be a treat in his bed so now i always have to give him another treat and my sister finds it really annoying because she's like oh i forgot to put the treat in his bed like i hate that you taught him that i'm like sorry but yeah that's pretty much it um i hope that you all enjoyed this random dog talk but i love you all very much and i hope you have a great night so good night good night good night", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "5Mxm9-FSV8o": "hi guys so before I start a shout out Dana T she requested I think it's a sheath since its Dana D she requested the soft-spoken video where I talk about my life my family were growing up you know she wants to know my style so I will do that while I let you see the background there is that I don't know how to point there babe oh babe there guys is the river we are at the river house and that one that one is our deck and I can't really see it in the viewer finder but the river I love it on the video because I did some videos before and while I checked it on the laptop my god I love the view I love water guys anything like even water from the horse but especially like river ocean waterfalls you know gorge everything and I love the sounds of Chris but we are inside a house so the visual I think is amazing so just you know so it doesn't matter you can't see me so well because you can see the river right candy sweetie let's have some candies it's sugar free sugar free I stole it from no he did steal it I got it from Michael's - its caramel flavor yeah I have made a trommel I've video before and I think I also spoke in a soft spoken voice so my life I'm almost 46 years old I was born and raised in the Philippines and I was there until I was 17 and 11 months in two weeks and then I went to Sweden before that I started a one semester in University of the Philippines in Varya Varya is up on a mountain skies it's cooler there it becomes around 10 now you can say that I had 10 to 16 degrees Celsius so around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit and I studied there I started my pre-med it was a bachelor's degree but my mom and stepfather convinced me to go to Sweden so we went it took them two weeks of calling me they wanted me to come before but I couldn't luckily I did it guys because when I came to Sweden that place there was a big earthquake there and one of my friends bring her back because of the earthquake so luckily okay I felt sorry for her and for the others but that's why I'm saying Maki I feel I have Cochin angels guys and somehow my subconscious listen to those angels so I started studying Swedish and then since I won you know I love languages and I was very serious okay I am serious in learning new languages so I studied subjects that I was already good at but I wanted to master the Swedish language you know I wanted to sound like a sweet so I did I studied so many subjects and I really wasn't sure what degree I would take as I said I started a pre-med boys back in the Philippines but I know I'm interested in science but not that interested not like my husband Michael so I kept on changing my degrees like to nursing which I didn't start but I just came in preschool teaching high school teaching the preschool teaching I studied for two years the young high school teaching I only went for two weeks I also started a economy boys I was only there for I don't remember if it was for two weeks or three months but anyways I didn't wait so long and what else but in the end I finished my social work so polite unites in social Bachelor of Arts in social work now I met my daughter's father while I was studying Swedish and we got married and we got Maria because I never dreamt of having kids but that marriage didn't last long only seven years but that's my longest relationship I had a serious boyfriend before that and and not so serious boyfriend after like my first boyfriend I had for one and a half years my second for some weeks so Maria's father was my longest long-term relationship her father is so strict but they not my much in any way I'm strict too when it comes to safety and hygiene I'm super super like germaphobic and I want my daughter to be safe and I'm all for safety too like generally so I wasn't happy with him mostly because our background was so different mmm now my second marriage was even a shorter marriage we were together for four years I was in love with him though but in the end I had to break it off now he was from her way but he stayed I think most of his life in Sweden no Maria's father is very good in technology I think Maria inherited that and I'm happy for that because I'm not so I worked late in my life I was and when it comes to love of course I have my husband now my girl and we have been doing the LDR thing long-distance relationship for two years and now we're married for one month and it's my longest dating before a marriage and I think that's very good because we got to know each other before getting married Michael is my much in any way I can think of like in how we all our personalities are matching or past our background is matching it's an engineer guys from aerospace and also a manager in aerospace he's retired now but that was his job I love striving so I think it should have been I try way too but he started a as as a chef in the ECAM camping-ground and I love that about him that we are both foodies and that we enjoy it oh you can can hardly see me guys but I too want you to see the river let's see if I can turn on the lights so you will see me flavor I think that's a little better very much like I can't believe he found me and I found him you know because I didn't expect this in my life and then usually tell you that your most that your happiest and you don't expect things and I guess that's all recipe Michael and I did not expect him to meet our soulmate so late in life and I'm not religious guys but I do think we're meant for each other and that God helped us find each other and better late than never right so I thought I would grow old without finding my soulmate and he thought it too so as they say third time's the charm something like that makes me so happy guys when it comes to work I work I started as I did studying in a culinary school awesome for one year but I started out as a personal assistant or you know a caregiver and I didn't like that job but it was hard to get a full-time job so I studied and became a social worker and but before that before I studied to become a social worker I also worked as a chef or as a really pastry chef for airlines like Lufthansa and you know I wanted to go back that was in between my college studying you know I took was it one year or two years I don't remember how many years at least one or two years Sabbath here of Sabbath here I wanted you know to rest from all studying but then the end I went back to school and I was like oh yeah it was 2 years yeah I studied that started studying social work my late stepfather was a social office chief for a big town so I guess I got inspired from that but I I worked as a social worker for three years but I was threatened by clients family and I didn't feel safe on continuing that job and if you know me you will know I'm not a social prison I'm far from her you can hardly see me guys so sorry about that so yeah if I win today but anyways I'm not so sure so I don't think I was meant to work with social work honestly I want what I really want is to entertain people and I have always done that since I was little I was always in the declamation contest in the sector and things like that and I love that I love winning all the contests that I joined except for one where my teacher gave me in longer version of a declamation script and I was disqualified but the judges talked with me and said that if I had the right script I would have won they told me so that is really my passion entertaining people at least from a Ford since I'm not socialized and I do hope someday my YouTube channels will grow bigger and I did get some revenues now but I am hoping it will grow because so that it would be like I'm not like hoping to be rich in YouTube but I do love it when I can you know shop and buy foods and things for the house I love it when I go to Dollar Tree and contribute to the household so I'm not earning a lot but it's little now but I want it to be like him a monthly salary like I don't okay of course every youtuber wants to be big and I would love that but I would just be you know happy if it was like a monthly salary like you know the normal age so I would be happy with that because this is my passion guy since I was little but you know going into entertainment doesn't usually require hire a an academic background and all of my family especially in my mom's I had an academic background so I never thought of acting as my career and pursuing it but I didn't know before because I wasn't thinking seriously about it I wasn't thinking that I could go to you know have a theater course in the university but I guess if someone told me I would pursue that you know going working in theaters and stuff but that could be stressful but that would be better then what I did what I did was trying so many crises and getting so many levels because of those courses if I knew if I got some support I would certainly try studying the theater course in the university that would that would have been awesome now I when we went back to the Philippines a few years ago I studied literature American literature and it was quite close to entertainment but not enough I was interested I was a bit passionate but not so much so I am passionate to put my husband though so my hope you know that I will be able to continue of my feelings I get the job here I will still continue with my videos guys until that they still want to watch me so guys I hope that they nerdy likes this video I hope you liked this video if you did please give it

this is Lin and Mei from Candylabs! Today, we're bringing you another candy-making video. Today, we'll be making a 7 kilogram batch of candy. The design will be a suhi or a maki roll. There will be 5 ingredients in our sushi candies: there will be crab, egg omlette, cucumber strips, salmon, and rice but all made of candy! We're adding the citric acid now. This is a strawberry-kiwi flavoured candy, so it's fairly sour. Now, we're pouring the candy from this pot onto the table, so we can cool them more evenly faster. [music begins and metal clangs of tools] This white, right here, is going to be the white for the sushi and the black on top is going to be our seaweed. [music, metal clangs, and scissors cutting] [music and scrapping noises] Now, we're folding the candies on the granite table. This helps us to cool down the sugar evenly and mix well the colour and flavour, as well. I guess you can say I am preparing the rice for our sushi and Mei is preparing the seaweed! Now, I'm going to stretch our rice - the white candy - on the hook. A lot of viewers ask me, \"Why do I put the white colour into the white?\" since we can stretch the candy to white. The reason for that is very simple: We can make the white even whiter and brighter. Right now, I'm stretching this piece of candy on the hook. This is what we use to stretch a bigger portion of candy, where we can't stretch by hand. We're going to stretch this piece about 120 times to give us the perfect texture and colour. And... 120! Look at that! How beautiful it is... [music and stretching noises] As you can see, we're stretching the smaller portion on the hot table. This way, it doesn't cool off too fast. Believe it or not, it actually requires more physical strength than if we stretch it on the hook! [scissor snip] [banging and stretching] [scissor snip] So right now, Mei is stretching the salmon, which is made of orange and white. I'm doing the pink part. That's going to be our crab meat. [music begins again, stretching and banging] Right now, we're working on the crab meat piece. We're going to make it a triangle shape just for the fun of it. But, the two little white triangles beside it are to maintain its shape. m[metal table banging, sticky rolling, and music] [scissor snip] So right now, I am making the omlette part of the maki. It's going to be a square shape inside the maki. We will place this one on top of the crab meat that we made. She's making the salmon piece inside the maki. That is going to be a quite complicated one. [music and metallic sliding] [music, sliding, peeling, and smacking] [scissor crunching and cutting] [music and sticky peeling] [music and sticky rolling] So now, we're using these two kinds of green to make the cucumber part of the maki rolls. There will be about 8 strips of cucumber slice inside the roll. [music ends] [louder sticky peeling and rolling] [scissor crunching the candy] We're going to wrap this cucumber rectangle with the white to separate them. Then, we're going to stretch them into 8 and stick them back together. Now, we have 2 pieces. I'm going to continue to stretch, and then cut them again so we can have 4. [scissor snip] [scissor snip] Now, I'm going to put our 8 cucumber strips next to our crab and omlette. [clunky rolling and scissor snip] [music returns, clunky rolling] Just like a real sushi, the ingredients in the middle are going to be covered by a layer of rice, which is our white candy right here. [music and stretching] Alright. Time to assemble. [music and swooshing wiping] [music and sticky peeling] [music and clunky rolling] So while she's making the sushi roll round, I'm going to make the final touch: the seaweed wrap around the maki roll. [music, smacks, and sticky peeling] Now, let's make this giant sushi roll small. This is where the magic happens, guys. The gravity will help us pull the candy. [metallic chops and music] [metallic rolling and chopping with music] Thank you very much for watching our videos. You can now book workshops online, where we teach your how to make your own sushi candies. Come visit us! We are located in downtown Montreal. Have a sweet day!

told me you just taste cannabis cannabis cannabis this is a tart watermelon this is kind of like the best way I can describe it but we'll see how they develop I'm with them to a more I'm out birkut flat flat [Music] [Music]", "AeCgzi8GLNQ": "oh yeah sexy biscuits nice [Music] hey youtube lumber's post 1975 and welcome to another fat friday food video a series of videos when i take a look at some of the more interesting things you can buy in the high street to eat uh also welcome back to the hottest day of the year in the united kingdom i know we said last friday when i just simply didn't have it in me to do a food video it was the hottest day of the year so far but apparently today is now going to be the hottest day of the year so far so i'm not happy i'm not happy apparently in the southeast it's going to hit 37 degrees good luck with that we're just going to hit 30 plus here and that's bad enough for me but why am i doing a fat friday video but i can't stand eating when it's hot well you've seen the thumbnail uh it's not cooked food it's not anything like that it's sweets or it's hard candy which we like to call them united kingdom boiled sweets they were these were very well i can't talk these were very kindly sent to me by by one of my american subscribers who watches fat friday videos and like most people has come to the conclusion that clearly i like hot food and spicy food and therefore thought he would send me these thank you very very very much you want to remain anonymous that's totally cool but i obviously send you an absolutely massive massive text message thank you because that's very kind of dude that's very awesome of you i expect nothing from anyone and certainly would never answer it but in the case of this because i'm generally very very interested challenge accepted now so johnny rancher hard candy cinnamon fart so the little bloke there with no arms my god i don't know how he eats dancing over fire there cinnamon fights clearly suggesting that these are hot which is an odd thing because they are boiled sweets and also on the back he says what's burning again suggesting that these are hot are they hot as sweets there's no reason they shouldn't be because i actually have in the other room from america that i haven't eaten yet that i'm saving for fat friday video uh um cinnamon for the record i'm not a fan of cinnamon very very rarely eat anything that it's in and when i discover that it's in it then i don't usually finish it because i'm not a fan of cinnamon um i didn't know it was known for its heat um i was assumed it was just like a natural sweetener or thing or cinnamon sticks or whatever to compliment in baking and things like that but maybe it could be hot there's no reason that you know sweets or board sweets can't be hot because beside that bag of uh skittles i have that chili flavor yeah um which i will do a video on eventually uh my friend it worked the other day because he knows i like hot food bought in from a specialized little sweet shop from a seaside town called weymouth that's for people that serve this country because seaside towns have species little sweet shops that can't concentrate on handmade specialized sweet spots of rock and stuff like that he brought me in a bag of we bought me in his bag and gave me a couple of his raspberry record i don't like sweets as well i absolutely do like sweets i don't have a sweet tooth whatsoever but little bloke on fire there has tempted me um yeah so he brought me in some raspberry um hard boiled like you know balls awkward and they were hot for two minutes of you know sucking on those balls awkward they were hot and nuked the back of your throat so maybe these are like those even though they don't have chili in them i put a picture up on facebook uh when uh i received them which was this week uh yesterday in fact um that uh i got these and one of my mates left the comments saying they are absolutely lush particularly good uh if you've got toothache which is a very odd sort of thing good you know sweets are good if you've got toothaches so i don't know there's some additional qualities of cinnamon i honestly don't know now however you can see that the bag is already open oh by the way when i said that you can't buy these in the high street obviously there are sweet import shops and stuff like that but you'll pay a sweet premium see what i did there uh quite a lot over the odds of what they would be i guess you know in america with them what are your options maybe maybe amazon but it's a thorough wedge mine look at that look at that they're all individually wrapped and there's a fair chunk of them in there so let's hope that they are nice or well i'm screwed but whatever they are that does not take away from the generosity of the individual who sent them to me yeah but also right it's supposed to be resealed bag i left these downstairs on sideboard yesterday and i cannot notice when i went to get them for this video that they are opened so the thing is about this house is if you have anything of an edible nature uh nail it down absolutely nail it down because people will consume it now i haven't heard anyone screaming you know uh running around trying to find water and stuff like that so you know someone's tried these but if they're really incredibly hot they've not told me or maybe they just opened that curiosity anyway i postponed long enough let's have a look or let's try i should say jolly rancher hard candy cinnamon fire um cinnamon i have tried cinnamon sweets i have tried for some reason whenever you were a kid and someone went to america and we did the same thing and you came back you would always bring back big red is it big red chewing gum which is cinnamon flavored chewing gum from the state simply because it's such a novelty because you don't get cinnamon chewing gum in this country and you would hand the packet out to everyone at school and they would eat one and not like it and then you'd be stuck with the rest but individually wrapped boiled sweet or hard candy i love it when you do that all sweets you gotta put it like that like like dismantling a cracker these have been in the fridge as well that is that good or bad thing that's where i put them after i found out that we had a uh a five finger discounter in the house if you are stuck to my teeth sorry there's no other way to do this but to do it with disgusting eating and talking at the same time oh that's odd i don't know if they take long to get hot oh that's very strange but i tell you what i can tell you feel right there on the end of my tongue it's got a combination of a little bit tingly an amish i mean is that what cinnamon does but the end yeah it's spread to the spread to right to the end of my tongue to the root of my mouth are they supposed to do this is this like a up batch or something but at the end of my time it's not completely numb but i am aware i'm drooling now from the size of a man i am aware that there's some sort of numbing effect of these sweets it's going to the back of my throat now and i don't like sweets my mouth's turned into niagara falls they are very nice they are very tasty and delicious i've turned into a drooling full yeah tingly and numb whole night's gone tingly and numb that must be what he meant when he said good for toothache i mean is there like an anesthetic nature to cinnamon i'm clutching at straws but very strange indeed tingly numb spreading of a whole mouth end of tongue particularly numb is am i confusing that with hot or supposed is it supposed to be hot because here's the thing there's a little sensation it's warm but i wouldn't say no in fact no i'm not going to say it's on fire it is not hot i hit the back of my throat but not like a curry like numbage that's the word of today numbage any of you who've had these i don't know are they supposed is this what the desire again not hot like a a very very strong flavor they're very nice and i don't like sweets they're really right quite very strong in their flavor which is cinnamony but they are not hot this little man here he's a lying bastard as is his colleague but keeping fresh resealable bags here we already talked about that not hot i don't know is this what constitutes hot in north america because if that's the case come on my ass i'll introduce you to a proper curry yeah warm-ish numbing tingly turned my mouth more so than anything else i eat when i eat into niagara falls not hot i feel that this is bad marketing i almost feel that this is pretty much an outright line but that's not to say they aren't without their charms would i have them again i'm going to finish the bag i'm going to take them and give them some people at work and split them with mates and stuff but sweets aren't my thing but as sweets go these are really really nice apologies again for talking my mouth full um yeah jolly rancher hard candy cinnamon farm they are very very very very nice unless different countries have different descriptive terms to what being on fire actually is they are not hot but they're very nice very very nice anyway as always thank you very much for watching and uh and if you've had these i mean is this what they're supposed to be like am i if i got a rogue batch or something you know it happens but if you don't have these and you ever come across these in your travels at least united kingdom pick them up i say i would give them a go anyway thank you very much for watching and i'll see you later", "MhAxL7ENWsY": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida this is greg today we're going to make some orange chocolate candy and it's going to be great for times like easter and we're making this thing using cocoa powder which solves a problem most chocolate candies to me taste like wax but this one tastes like chocolate and then it fades into orange jake added the orange oil which you saw in that little vial to the hot candy and then poured it on the candy cooling table and now he's adding colors because we need an orange component and the rest is going to be colored brown and it'll be colored brown by the cocoa powder itself if you look carefully as he adds the color you'll see that he's stirring it in and the color starts to boil this is because the color contains some water in it and the water evaporates out because the liquid is not water it's molten sugar and the molten sugar is so hot it raises the water in the food coloring past the boiling point and boils out all the water keeping the candy from being sticky the white powder is citric acid as the orange flavoring has no acid content you don't get the sour of an orange and we have to add it in retroactively and now jake just works the cocoa and the citric acid in so when he does the next step hopefully the cocoa powder won't go all over the place and truthfully it does a lot of the time [Music] anyway [Music] do and now it's time to do the break break the bars away from the candy the candy is partially cooled here the center is still hot and molten the edges where it touches the metal is cool and jake has to even out all the temperatures and he does this by folding we usually do this with dripping the candy too but the cocoa powder goes everywhere so this is more of a delicate process than we normally have to do with the candy [Music] i'll keep that [Music] [Music] [Music] um this candy is part of an assortment we make chocolate orange chocolate black cherry chocolate pomegranate chocolate strawberry and chocolate raspberry and if you want to try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.pd.net we ship to most of the world so we can get it to you almost no matter where you are jake is building the orange stripes they'll be a bit muted because they'll be hidden between the chocolate which is a dark color but hopefully it'll allow you to identify the different flavors because each of the flavors is in a different color this is part of our easter assortments we have more than one of them we have these chocolate fruit drops we're going to have some old rabbit rollers and chick rollers from the 1800s making drops in marshmallow flavor and we're working on a third one which will be an image candy assortment of all sorts of easter themes we haven't done this for a number of years but we've had enough requests asking for it we thought it would be fun so over the next couple of days or weeks you're going to see new flavors appear at our website [Music] hmm jake stretches the candy preserving the stripes and he cuts off a hunk to put through our old candy press this press will make square chip shapes and it was made in 1879 so it's older than we are by a long shot but i love a piece of machinery that was designed to work for a very long time and then did can you imagine thinking about building a machine that you're designing to last for a few hundred years you know it'll be used long after you die think about the pride and the manufacturing of this stuff and it shows in the quality of the equipment sadly there isn't much of it out there and people ask me all the time where do you get it the answer is from old candy makers who want it to be preserved and they call me up every now and again and say i've got this would you like it and i feel because of that that i'm part of this tradition that's been passed down over the centuries if you like this video please subscribe to us here on youtube and click the

things to me of course we're on facebook instagram and twitter and we have two facebook pages public displays a confection for the candy and lofty pursuits for our retail store now it is time to break the candy into individual pieces jake does this both by dropping it and by scraping it across the table with a scraper [Music] so [Music] so thank you for watching if you ever make it to tallahassee

Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops thank you for watching if you like this video please go to our website www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam a be lucky to see us do it but we don't make it all the time and we

"DiLc2xUQxWA": "[Music]", "vxDsf_KMnxg": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we are making our own candy lollipops, spirals, candy with a pattern on the inside\nand sherbet filled candies. What you'll need to make these is some sugar,\nglucose syrup, water and some cream of tartar. Put the sugar and the water into the pan with\nthe glucose syrup. Place that over high heat. If you've got any sugar crystals on the sides\nof your pan then you just want to wash those down using a wet pastry brush. Turn your oven on to 100C or 210F and place\na tray lined with non-stick baking paper in to warm up. Let your sugar mixture boil until it reaches\n150C or 302F. Turn off the heat and stir through the cream\nof tartar. Now we will follow this same basic process\nfor all of our candies. For the sherbet filled candy add yellow food\ncolouring and stir it through. And then pour that into a warm tray that has\nbeen lined with baking paper. Now to protect our hands from the heat we\nare going to use .. silicone gloves but these are not going to be enough so we are also\ngoing to use cotton gloves underneath them. Oh, and let me show you my nails while we\nare here - these are one of the designs in my own line of wraps that I'm doing with Jamberry. These ones are called YUM and they have cute\nlittle icecreams on them and I'll link to them below. For those of you who asked last week what\nare wraps? They are bit like stickers made out of nail\npolish, and you use a little bit of heat to stick them onto your nails. And they last up to few weeks. We are going to put these ones through some\nrough treatment today with heat and gloves and in and out of gloves. Fold in the edges towards of the hot sugar\ntowards the centre and then lift it up and begin to pull it out and then fold it back\nin. The more you pull it, the more shiny and opaque\nit becomes. If you want it to be transparent then don't\npull it much at all. Place it back in the tray and flatten it out\nas much as you can and then put it in the oven to warm up again. Now that it's warm you can stretch it into\na rectangle. Now usually when chefs make this sort of candy\nthey have a heat lamp shining on the candy that keeps it warm while it's on the counter\nso you don't need to keep putting it back in the oven, but they are super expensive\nso this is the way to do it home. Place a generous amount of sherbet down the\ncentre of your rectangle and then bring the sides up and around to cover it. Push down each of the ends to seal in the\nsherbet. Squeeze it to make a cylinder shape and then\nplace it back in the oven for about 30 seconds to a minute, just keeping an eye on it because\nyou don't want to overheat it. Once you can just stretch it when it's soft\nenough to stretch, pull the candy to make a long snake. Working quickly before it hardens make firm\nindents along the candy so that you are sealing in the sherbet into each one. To make lollipops we'll need a few different\ncolours in the one batch. So place strips of foil along the tray and\nthen cover it in baking paper. Prepare the candy just like we did before\nbut this time add a few drops of essence, I am using a fairy floss flavour. You can buy all different ones and then just\nflavour your candy. Pour some hot mixture into each of the sections. And then to get you pan clean all you need\nto do is fill it up with water and leave it to soak and the sugar will just dissolve off. Add food colouring to each section in the\ncolours that you are after for your lollipop. And then using scissors, cut along the baking\npaper so you can work with one colour at a time. Fold it into the middle and then stretch it\nuntil it becomes opaque. Make it into a snake and then set it aside. Repeat that with the blue. And the red\nAnd the yellow and the clear one as well to make it white Then warm them slightly again in the oven\nand place them together to make a cylinder and squeeze them so that they stick together. Cut the cylinder in half and leave some to\nkeep warm while you stretch the other half. Twisting as you stretch so you get that pretty\npattern. Take a lollipop stick and poke it into one\nend then wrap the mixture around and around pressing it into place. And you can keep going to make your lollipop\nas giant as you want it to be. To make the spirals remove the mixture from\nthe heat and add in flavouring, for this one I am using musk. Split it into two sections and add red colouring\nto one half and blue into the other. We are going to take the blue half and pull\nit and stretch it to make it opaque but with the red half we are just going to leave that\nand not pull it all. Keep pulling the blue half and twisting it\nso that you can see there the more we pull it and the more we twist it the more opaque\nand shiny it becomes. Don't pull the red half just cut it in half\nto make two long cylinders. Pull the blue into two long snakes too and\nthen stack them up to make a square. It looks a bit like toothpaste. Squeeze them together to round it out and\nthen cut that into two. Working with one half pull it and make it\nthinner into a nice thin long stick. And you can slice it while ti is warm to make\nindividual candies OR to make the spirals, wrap it around a thick skewer. Once it is all the way to the end you can\njust pull the skewer out and leave those to cool. See how the pink there is totally transparent\nbecause we didn't pull it and the blue is opaque. The other thing you can do is roll some of\nthis mixture into a ball and make round lollipops and just put a stick in one end. And you can make as many different candies\nas you like just by flavouring and colouring each one differently. And now for something which is going to be\nhard to do without a heat lamp but I reckon we can do it. We're going to split the mixture into three\nand colour some red, leave some plain and colour the last section green. Pull each of the colours just like we have\ndone before to make them opaque. And then stretch the red one to make three\nlong snakes, return one to the oven to warm up. And once it is soft and pliable, place it\nacross the top of the two red snakes and shape it at the top into a point. Add some white along each side of that triangle\nand then flip it up the other way and add a strip down the centre on the top. And then finally add more white so that the\nred is completely covered. Warm your green, and stretch it out and add\nit over the top of the white so that it goes all the way around. Now you are going to need to place that back\nin the oven to warm it up because those two red ones are quite cold by now. And once it's warm you can just stretch that\ncandy out into a long strip. Now to cut it without it shattering it needs\nto be quite warm so return it to the oven until you can bend it like this. And then quickly using a sharp knife, chop\noff pieces to reveal the little heart inside.

Pokemon candies it's almost hard to get it all on camera here but I'm gonna go ahead and cut this up a little bit so it makes it a little bit easier you got Pikachu Eevee and then some Pokemon I don't recognize as all you guys know from my other Pokemon things I reviewed it's kind of hard for me to remember newer ones even though I might have played the game there we go now that these are all organized let's go ahead and take a closer look right here we have a Pikachu pineapple which is a kind of a cute play on words you could chew pineapple and then this is what the back looks like ask some little thing right here almost looks like it might be a gotcha but I don't know if it's actually a gotcha it seems like there's something in this top thing but it'd be kind of weird if there was who knows I'll check it out ten grams of sugar per pack not too bad especially for hard sugar candies now we got ourselves a evey ten point nine grams expires 20 2002 morrow to 2020 and these are lime no melon looks like melon flavor now we got a Pokemon but I don't quite recognize I believe this is the pokemons son legendary let me know in the comments below and this is Cola or soda flavor I believe and then I believe this is from Pokemon moon and this is ramen a flavor ooh I don't know what this guy's from looks to be a ghost type but it's the nefarious grape flavor I am met again I am again met with I'm trying you last alright so let's go in order for the first thing I want to do which I doubt there's anything in here but I'm gonna open up this little pouch right here just to kind of like see what it's all about no there's nothing in here you think there would be I guess it's just holding up on the rack since there's so many things hanging off of it all right let's go ahead and open up the pineapple Iike juice these are what they look like inside they kind of look like pills I'm not gonna lie I want to spell out on my display so this is gonna be when I try see how it tasted I'm gonna be honest at first I thought it tasted a little bit like a vitamin but once I've been kind of settled into my mouth I think it was just the flavor for the pineapple cuz I'm not used to having pineapple flavored things I'm used to having to speak either pineapple I don't think that that's a really popular artificial flavor but after it's settled I kind of gave me a very sweet tarts or Smarties kind of feel to them not bad once you get past the initial flavor the aftertaste is good let's go ahead and move on to evey that out of the way looks like they're all gonna be white actually this one looks like it might be a little bit more bluish let's see how it tastes this one's really good I like this one a lot I do believe that it's melon flavor I could be wrong though but I really do like the flavor this one is pretty good a lot better than the first one that I tried didn't give me that vitamin kind of a flavor to it I think I'm going on the wrong path I think this one's next a zoom in on that real quick I'm getting a lot on a focus these are what these ones look like I believe they look a little bit more Brown than the other ones yeah just a little bit though see how it tastes that is surprisingly very well Cola flavored kind of reminds me of like I know this might sound bad but it's actually not bad it tastes like a flat Coca Cola and I know flat Coca Cola doesn't sound super appetizing or anything but it's actually not bad especially since there's no carbonation so it doesn't feel like it's off you just get that kind of Cola flavor with it that makes any sense let's try these romani flavored ones you know they're really blue looking see how it tastes those hands down are the best one so far and I think if you know me you already know how this one's gonna go time to trap that time to tackle down the infinite well I cannot talk today time to tackle down the infamous grape flavor might leave that tongue tie in just cause it's kind of funny let's open this up of course the only one that gives me trouble with the packaging is that grape flavor alright let's go ahead and try it well oh yeah mmm definitely grape flavored well without having to say this is definitely my least favorite let's put that down zoom in on it real quick this is my top favorite my third favorite my fourth favorite and then I think I'm I think I'm doing this wrong I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do this for you ready best okay top bottom and then everything in between I am NOT very good at talking in this episode I'm having trouble today but yeah no I I actually really liked most of these except obviously the grape one so yeah I huge shout out to my patreon so thank you guys so much for your support you guys are super appreciated if you enjoyed this video

measuring how much water is left by the temperature because you can't get over a certain temperature because water won't get me hotter than 212 degrees so as you deal with like 5050 water and sugar as that percentage goes down the solution can get hotter mm-hmm to its maximum temperature so we're measuring moisture content at the 310 we should be under 5% water now if you get over the burning point to sugar and get rid of all the water the sugar burns caramelize this turned brown and that's very round problem his family used to do to 320 and it would get wouldn't have as much as nice of a white snow and I think that made me partially the stove just the nature of the good stuff here wheat which we switch to 310 a while back and that's what all users did you switch because I used to do you just switch this he was feeling whole himself that day music you know what I'm doing 310 well that's cool I'm in a concern two of the games like that too but it's fine hmm I can go up to about three or five on the right circumstance the candy will be hard enough it'll just be in my experience more susceptible to humidity you know because it just has more water so it can absorb less and stay hard but yeah we used to do three or five I mean hard practice what 292 something theoretically can be hard over any time not hard crack Park wall anytime you're over hard wall temperature I don't remember what that is I tend to work above us I remember what it is either I used to decent he's known as a kid making candy at home he Smith well the only thing we made a homeless fire church was that was more softball mm-hmm not hard ball baller hit while I play hard ball now all the time yes ma'am I was sure we have you're not holders that we need but we do know yeah we're about to hit the urine Tanika do tell Dante how humble are pronouncing that right basically this is doing a phase stage so it's a why god I can't remember my chemistry back from college it's been 25 years basically as it goes to the transition from mostly water to mostly sugar it changes how it behaves and somewhere around 257 degrees have you ever noticed just sort of slows down getting hotter then I want to passes that point it accelerates yeah and that point is where does this transition and that's where it transitions from a solution to a different type of fluid these two when two different materials are dissolved into one another can often behave like this this is how blue ice works so blue ice is a mixture of propylene glycol not ethylene glycol and water ethylene glycol being toxic but really tough so it's not your car's antifreeze and they're in a proportions that the freezing point is below whatever temperature one blue i3 refrigerator it's usually like 28 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Fahrenheit so when it freezes it becomes solid but it takes a whole lot of energy to make it freeze but also takes a whole lot of energy to get through that point to make it defrost so it stays cold longer and that's why you want blue ice sugar and water does exactly the same thing except it's just annoying it doesn't have a useful purpose it just takes longer to boil and then it goes young because yes snow as the temperature goes off and then it speeds up again so the atomic bonds are breaking or something that once they're broken it's like I don't actually know it's taking a lot of energy to do something but I haven't actually thought about it in sugar I've got a very large treatise on the subject that I haven't been able to slog through so the ice there hasn't been a lot of research in the candy industry but there's been a lot of research in the ice cream industry because they need to deal with the continuous process continuous process on coconut oil and with continuous process cooking you have to take into account how long you need to calculate the thing needs to move through the continuous process because they're not doing it a batch at a time you can't just wait you something else is coming behind it so you bake things longer and the continuous process thing by having it run down an assembly line longer yes who's pouring this badge Stevie's gonna be you and me or think so look I make sure them can you make sure that area is greased that's query I calculate how big it needs to be I saw the one on the right this one no they're all looking I don't see like the whole forever yeah I think I think you did the whole venue yeah there's a brad sighting we have a newcomer behind you don't be alarmed or anything yes we have a little max discovered a little dry spell just so oh I don't need don't worry about that end it's the other end okay so how do you want us to pour this as far we're still learning our lesson right no do you like to do it while it's still boiling or I just wish soon as we turn it off I tend to pop pour it so I get as much heat as possible or some flavors in the pot if it's what we call a weak one we will do that in plan sometimes you do the orange that way because it is slowly I usually pour it in the pot and stir and so that it has as much heat as possible to evaporate off that water so I have more time to work with the other one and get the end ploy off the colors now you have a gel food coloring and I usually use water based so yours has less water in it so I shouldn't have any trouble but your flavor be babe yeah yeah that's actually that's very much what I do but the gels gonna work just as fast it's not going to be any different if anything it's gonna solve problems I like that because I can mix colors more easily when I need to combine a yellow or green or whatever to make a different shade it's very hard to mix in with the jealous it's very easy to mix them just by going drop drop drop into that so I tend to use that and since i buy that by the gallon it's what's laying around it's like the wooden spoons that everybody thinks is plastic and it's going to dissolve in the candy when I make it there's a the real question is well the real reason I use them is they're lying around there are wooden to go store ice cream readily available easy to do got a little ways to go away over there in the citric are we using the citric acid today yes okay now do you have a measuring cup by any chance just sure actually do you want to do this with citric acid or without C because the stuff I made gave you yesterday citric acid in it and this way you can do it before and after taste look it's not sound good just in the first square right there it should be the right amount of I did my math right with not slow down and I'll move the bar yeah get your scraper Steve you feel like you don't know it was right I got about there it is who we meet you this tan scraper did you know how we always stuff so the host cards don't hurt hmm without the winning game man where we're moving just one you guys are gonna let me introduce you right yeah was it always this way fun times I was just like go to the grocery store put some holiday without being filmed okay right is it weird flying in not thinking yeah yeah now this is where I would just start mixing it all up and get it cooled down instead of mill this isn't a master okay let me get the gloves off now oh well just for the moment I get a little more dexterity and so we're gonna do about third third and third so this is wider than I normally do normally I do it deeper and narrower but you only have the limitation of this bar sorry so we're gonna see how this works do the choose your corner judgement usually they go all the way across but it's going to be hard to cut all the way across without it flowing out so I'm going to try to do is I'm gonna try to do that's gonna be hurt you I think I'm just gonna go all the way across you're gonna want these aren't you eventually oh this is cooling down so much faster than anything I've ever felt oh just at that end okay that's good oh this is about a third so and hopefully we won't have a problem that the sides getting cold really fast turn off whatever fan is behind me okay yeah yeah this is fighting me fast so this is gonna be the light our nose right there cuz this right here it's getting cold - too fast and this side it's a little hot okay so we think that is great for ya the sides already ready oh this is much faster than I'm used to see but that side isn't ready yet that's gonna be interesting for me to cut I should have done it the other way but don't break it oh I see haha your tabletop sticker at this end then descent probably isn't relevant for what you do normally but it's here so I'm breaking the vacuum you know I felt the table so fight so I'm gonna go about a third right here so I think we do this one first this is gonna be the pulling light and I take that drip it right over here we're gonna keep that going I'm gonna take this for the orange slices pull this over here and leave it on the hot spots I can work it a bit that's going to be pulled and this over here so I'm right now what all I'm doing is I'm folding it trying to get the cold bits and hot this mix right so why don't you start folding that I'll start holding this you see how little orange I put in there yep Steve may have another paddle please [Music] the secret is not to let it touch very long because when the paddles heat up we're gonna probably switch sides here cuz that sides warmer and this is your polling so it needs to say the warmest this is that why he kind of separated so you have the warm side Anna cool side yeah I get to use the table for an advantage of it on my table I yeah I tend to like the clear on the other coldest I'd actually this way worked pretty well because parts have to cold park is too warm and I was able to mix them but you see we got three roughly even pieces here and we're trying to get them oh yeah I tend to use the rubber gloves when it's really hot because I can handle the little cold bits on the edge but since I make a longer thinner thing I end up with more cold fish Steve I think this is about the right temperature to pull what are you maybe a little hot well actually I was about to turn it to the house so let me go over there I'm gonna put this thing in front of your here this is just a little warm I am Lauren that I should listen to brag to me oh I wonder bring that piece over here there yeah all the way back to the right and the chute soon as she's out of here I can set up a camera that's my present cook you saw my - yeah but what if you're Robert Phillips goes to the chopper there's a ya bonus for the customers like your ball of corn syrup it's a lot warmer huh we just flip it so doesn't stick to the canvas is it well elbow is that what the issue is okay I need the scissors go ahead don't tell you that if we turn the air back yes please turn your back on I'm sorry if it's getting hot but I'm used to it being hot my candy shop yeah I guess one concern is that we do have chocolate down here so let's see oh I see what you're saying here let me give this thing's fault so we're doing you got to get this to go fast or you can pulled out so I'm doing long pulls obtain the heat we can't how to get you cool yeah which means pulling quickly is the thing now we really hammered the hook to shake it loose oh you're gonna need that no not if I do it right the hammer service no I don't hammer the hook you can put crystals back in the candy you can actually make it crystal eyes I know it's not 100% likely if you keep this thing rotating so the same torque moves off the hook at a time you can put forward and backwards you distribute the heat it's sticking to the hook because hook is heated up so is that make sure you keeping the hook cool I'm not moving yeah okay so that if you do that it shouldn't stick but it requires moving fast because if you move slow you get more heat on the hook once the hook passes a certain temperature I have no idea what it is the candy I want to stick to it and to those into this metal scrapers you have a candy stuck to us oh yeah they just got hot yep okay there we go so now the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna make our try this we're gonna make our triangles by cutting this into six parts so I'm just gonna cut this in half and this half is gonna be like you want them to be about the same now we're going to just pull them out and I'm going to cut it into thirds you want the thirds to be as even as you can [Music] see this one looks a little smaller yeah I'm gonna cut this here a little bit to that I thought looks pretty even yeah that looks pretty good okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna make three triangles of the same way and I'm gonna put these over here so they can cool down because we want them particularly cool this red needs to be the dark orange needs to be the hottest of all of them actually I'm going to stick this on your galvanized so cool even faster don't you thank you oh yeah so we really want triangles to be triangles and to be able to keep their shapes this way this can actually get too cold because we're about to reheat it with the with the outer wrap and if it's not cool enough you go shape this one too and I'm rotating them to get a nice sharp edge all gonna be the same length not to be too cold the temperature differences here are much greater than in Florida we're gonna be able to do this very very quickly and this area seems like it's cool enough to keep it from getting much cooler and not to keep it hotter thank you so now this thing we're gonna cut up in a white off this is gonna be the bottom layer for the middle okay push it okay if it's a little too wide it's not okay if it's too narrow okay so I'm gonna put this right on here put this right down here by the way I usually keep a wet sponge what I'm trying to do this without it lying around glue a very damp sponge a very slightly damp sponge I can put it down I can glue stuff together that doesn't want to stick don't need it if I do this right I won't need this so now I'm just gonna pull a strip of white out and I want you to do just one I want you to take this stretch it to the same length press it down make sure it's wider than this piece of orange because if it's too long it's okay and I'm pressing the center right there making sure cuts all the way to the bottom I want you to do the same okay I want you to being about the same thickness kept two portions right kneecap oh you got too much bit I think so you do a tribe now you know we'll make you see how thick it is so what we're gonna do is we're just going to pull this longer get it to the right thickness and I'm just going to cut it to the right length I'm gonna keep this stock here I'm gonna fold in the middle flow okay there you go now you could always if you need to make it square your spatula and you can push it in or you can slide the candy to the spatula to get a straight line okay now why don't you put that right on there this side yeah press it in and wanna make sure because all the way down to the bottom if there's like orange touching orange it never looks good now we're gonna grab another one of these triangles I'm just gonna fit it in here now half of its done and I'm just gonna thicken it around now you're gonna do the other half and you're just gonna you don't have to put this white divider in because we've already got it so if you're gonna do is you're gonna put a white side here a white side here put the green in but when you make the white side I want you to pull it out like this because this will give you a better idea how much can you're using and II feel better about yesterday by the way you didn't see me make the lollipop it's a little wider because I can see it's wide enough okay yeah press it on one side loose yeah just like that now you got to do one more of these just like this by the way the utensil heating up includes the scissors that's why I always keep two or three pairs of scissors around oh this is the perfect put it in here it doesn't matter we can just rotate it around I thought this okay see how it's too short I'm gonna spread it out okay so it's gotta be the same same width top to bottom or longer it can be longer now put the top one I'm just gonna push these two together so the white pith touches the white pith nope you're just putting this right in between the two just floor it straight up and press it at all so okay so now we have two halves March our entrance and all right so I'm gonna round this one off a little bit more because I want them both to be the same width it'd be easier if we put it together and I'm just gonna together like this now you know wants that wet paper towel very damp very slightly wet paper towel might be useful right now see I'm not used to the bottom getting cold because your he comes from above my key comes from below there we go so now I'm just gonna go like this so now yeah well that's excellent now I need you to this over here whoa and you need to make sure it goes 360 degrees in all parts of it since my table is evenly heated you need to so you're only rolling it halfway you need to roll it 360 degrees and I'm assuming with that heater you're gonna have to lift it up occasionally and turn it or one spot it's always the spot is always going to be the hot at the hottest does that make sense uh-huh so now you see you see one the white right here didn't come all the way to the edge oh okay so now we have to figure out the diameter of this so I'm gonna mark that I am to here with my finger it's gonna go around to here okay so that's how wide I need my white to keep it rolling okay and now we needed as long as this piece I may have used a little bit too much white in the center so we may end up not using the whole thing thank you okay let me yeah so your heating thing is hotter in the back and cooler in the front mine's hotter on the left and cooler on the right so I'm having a little trouble converting so we're doing this we just made a little to body now putting the pith on well so it's not sticking just gonna take this goggle it we did see somebody else it's just glue you know water makes candy sticky sometimes it's a useful thing yeah okay we make this a little smaller make our life easier and to hold more heat in can you continue to roll this okay now we're gonna do the outside wrap this can be done by one person it's very difficult to learn with Walker's okay I need a measurement to know how long I'm in so you see the seam here it's a real easy measurement we're gonna put the seam here we're gonna roll it around goes to the hole you'll notice when I'm pulling it I'm lifting it up if you don't lift it up it pulls unevenly I had a thin spot you usually have thick spots over here you just cut off the fix pocket the scissor to patch the thin spot donal ever notice that looks good let's do another measurement from here to there it looks like I've got the right distance so I'm gonna see you're gonna lift that up I'm gonna slide this over and you put it right down the center mm-hmm I'm gonna put this up like this I'm putting this up like this if you notice I'm not rolling it over I'm pulling it over because I made it a little smaller there's the overlap it's it's better to stretches now the whole things now if you notice I did two things I made the outside wrap a little longer I don't always have that option but that that'll reheat the ends too we made the inside very cold eventually we wanted all the same temperature so what I did to solve that problem is the outside wrap is hotter it's heating up the inside it's evening everything else it's just something I don't show this on the video because it can take a while but just by poking the end I can tell if it's heating up or not evening everything out and the last bit here it's gonna be too cold anyway that's why I pinch off the ends that in the image listen so now we're gonna pinch it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna size it down to a smaller diameter so once you try that we're gonna roll it and pinch at the same time slowly it's not a lot of pinching is you don't to distort it too much now we're gonna start stretching it they grip the right there that's actually easiest way to do it we just want the force to go everywhere evenly just what beat your help you see how that works that got my start beautiful you know I have to keep it moving because I'll get a flat side if I don't also I'm gonna need that white chopper over there you see this little spot over here so now all we need to do just do a smooth motion and we have orange fun thing about this is another scissors of yours again start stretching this out my goal is to keep the back half I need you to help now okay you're gonna be the roller so once I put this out it's still going to be hot in there if it is hot when it um it sort of if it's hot that's out here you can just I need to roll it on currents gonna fight you because it's gonna have a flat side at first that make sense yeah I'm trying to do it on this those pads I have have some grip and definitely help the roller now when I give these to you the hot ones are going to want to stick to other hot ones right so put a hot one between two over it okay and then it won't not only want it to sit but the cool ones always keep it straight now it's your turn to pull I didn't use my chopper here's the stuff see how it got flat side here so your job is to keep the I might drop sir keep the spinning your job is to pull go to the other side of me and I'm gonna show you how the pulling works sort of like petting a cat you don't kind of tack by choking it you pet a cat by sliding your hand down it yeah that's perfect and you're aiming for good I hotter the other way this can be as long as you can handle don't worry about twisting your [ __ ] neck Indians you want us to show here and go or if you end up with too much hanging off at it we'll all go down at once why don't you wanna shortest you know characters get wedding we're making it look like something that we can would like others to choke chopper this is a sharp edge that works by the way what I'm doing is not what it looks like you're you roll what I'm doing its up swinging it all the way what we're trying to do is we're not so much cutting it is we're breaking what I mean by that it's watch this this is a non-newtonian fluid so if I get a sharp enough blow it'll just wear smoothly and straight that's kind of dull you might want to try the round end of the scissors and you have a better lock watch the other side Heil smoochy yeah if you cut it with scissors it'll be like a candy cane and you have to do that right now if you want to see if we cut it with scissors it just sucks I mean when you cut it it's oh it's gonna be fine that's the pitch but you it'll be absolutely fine but you lose a piece at the end then at the image on IV broad yeah and that could be you know one out of every 30 pieces you don't want to do that keep them rolling you don't you oh keep all rolling yeah can you come down here take this over I'm gonna give you some pictures gloves oh you got that kind of gloves - your stick just keep it rolling like this you want to do a full 360 degrees this end should be closer to the heat source so now we're gonna come down here so we actually want to do you see how that one had a little bend in it super oh so now because these things this thing's still gonna get as long as the conventions you get a flat side I'm going to keep rolling yeah gotta be in the air like that give me against the table who's against the table you're swinging fruit so what I do is I hold the thing off with my left hand [Music] and by the way the length of dispossession covered by your ability so you can't roll any wider than about this spread of your arm right it's thinner he's got a cup inner floss [Applause] are you supposed to keep rolling but I certainly know a certain point they're hard like that okay and then I tend to scoot the hard ones off because they're not necessarily in order when you alternate okay this is getting a little cold this is getting to support one of the trick is not to let it get this long yeah lots of distortion up there that's okay but back this off you see how that broke yeah not too cool at this point it'll stretch it very cool always okay it'll be chopped it's a piece of cinema sure oh you can have to keep it rolling for that I'm just gonna work around the roller it's flexible enough we don't keep the heat even doesn't take long and the heavier it is the more likely it is to flatten out [Music] now I'll tell you if you're doing something a car you can get away with doing letter yeah the more detail to design but the orange is really it's forgiving it's where we start people go go the only way you learn like anything else is doing now look at how easy is pulling it up and just cannot be what it was like pretty was a kid yeah you're this good reviewer kid oh yeah try the ground into the scissors this seems to be better you gotta let it pass through and here commute for dropping it's attached to something else should we have the fans we usually well that might be useful over there yeah oh thank you oh yeah yeah but I mean this is going off so fast in here but yes we use a fan too know what's kind of on it'll be fine they do break they break when they cool and they're not round it makes cutting a little bit slower you like the cards if you're cutting multiple sticks at a time which is the efficient way to go let's say two of them stick together go play with the non-newtonian properties to break apart well if a section becomes too cold sacrifices yeah you don't know one party to hack off of it just like every day's the same this is the same thing we should be very similar to point an oh we're just keeping it rolling you did it right to a triangular right yeah I've seen from the French guys new candy canes with squares where three each three on one side one each on the other side needle inside right no no no that was handmade ones oh let me take a lecture get a four out of it so now let's take a look in a second this is different than mine it's coming down here so let's just on my I do have an over this veto in a batch roller and I have the name of the board the trick here is to make sure all side computers yeah right so if you just go like this on the half three yeah I can't get the border to cash out okay you can do it this is pride by the way you want to get a good deal by the way it's tough at this is this is as tough as I like it when I'm doing the real detailed work because the hotter it is the less distortion you get in the middle or the colder it is the less distortion does this kind of more stays play I'm really gonna want some footage off you different all right there we go I made a swamp just the only time you've ever made arcane is over then yes the first time yeah we're gonna start cutting somewhere around here we have that metal block right there come on right there yeah so this looks like a perfect thing to use you just need a sharp edge so let's take these I'm gonna go for the cool ones to do in about two or three of those they want to break under their own weight so you really need to open the hands and the longer they are you may want to break them in half before you ever cut them so all this is just it's actually just about the perfect thing to use also so Steve those ones are so they I want use the ones ever come over there once you take them away yeah here's the things yeah so you're gonna start with one we're gonna start with not a long walk but a short so you're gonna put this over here now gonna angle it down like that and this has to hit at the right angle to this I don't care what angle you do you just have to follow it's that way exactly sideways a little think of it as scissors can do it absolutely flat it's hard to do it because your hand wants to angle so I usually find the comfortable angle for my hand to go speed and I match it with this does that make sense otherwise you end up hurting yourself if it dings if it gets chipped you know it doesn't go all the way through rotate it a little bit you're not going to get it to work on the same way you try to oh you want it's just harder to do they can't be apart at all daily I know I need an apartment even you apprentice there is a machine one is currently meeting me and all I can hope of everyone who talks about it it's pretty terrible candy that doesn't looks like you no one was made I'm not sure when I'm in the nineteen forties thirties World War two it's obviously a European it was an American make the makers name would be stamped on every possible area this is nothing there are two guys you know the one that's currently being made doesn't do a good job this one appears to but the one I have let's look at apart and suddenly tears and what scared - I'm sure I can take it apart that's I have a friend who rebuilds transmissions [Music] [Music] do you see this you see the jagged pieces it wasn't a no straight angle oops well see how you just got that turn it maybe halfway now from longer strokes and some pieces may just be set up they want to shatter yeah I don't by the way I don't wear those heavy gloves at this point I can tease dude I'm just wearing vinyl oh yeah actually it's not really when I'm going fast like I don't go but uh i neva then yeah I can't but if I'm doing the angwa power strokes as close as possible without hitting it this head tells the blade I mean it doesn't mess up the candy way your back on if you get tired let me know I'll take over I didn't have the muscles to do the damn g'day I'm creams but I have the muscles to do this oh yes make it stuff in there after a while like four funnels in it I can't be more than like five pounds or yeah I think it's just after like oh we're just discussion yeah holding that funnel for like that line it was not that long for me and it just broke me down it's actually my knees because you had on the low thing and I was crouching you know I'm afraid I have a few want to do another batch of this but I think the ribbon candies but people we're gonna want to stay doing really I got so many comments why don't you do it like her with her fingers I was wondering when you were saying fruit by the foot what you were talking about yeah [Music]", "VGsDR2DCjpw": "they were here sooner somebody wasn't in the way yeah we doing three or four foot or three [Music] but [Music] hi Roman small version growing oranges to turn it on this woman oh yeah so you guys should be okay aren't you glad we got it what's your coupons you're glad I think one of our viewers planted the seed for that what am i joke not appealing I got some more juicy ones in store come on don't get pissy you get pity with me she's not she's just stuffing up and it's gonna leave me alone right somebody's gonna have this interest and tell us that I feel like people might not get my pissed one because yeah the pith is like the white part in between yes correct I know you know but I didn't know that and until when I was a raw vegan that's when I found it there's also I was eating nothing but true basically I don't know why using where it just sounds like you're trying to say another word no but you have a lisp tree but I guess watch your heads yeah I'll be watching others does the second batch of the day with the citrus citric acid [Music] so what was original ratio that you guys tried last batch 1/8 of a teaspoon of citric acid per 2 cups of sugar now Mac said he could tell thousands Terry under the bed could not that people who work dead it was perfect cups of sugar so we don't that was the ratio it got from Lauren oils from their website so we don't we're just try not start now smile we don't know they meant to include corn syrup in there as a sugar so we did not burn terms like a super sugar so so we just did so n equal two tips or two teaspoons for the first bachelor so this time around we're good time for cheese business we're doing two-tone on this too yes a little bit just like the other one except it's going to be orange maybe whoa sweet sweet a for nude pretty rad right yeah check out my recent ready those are pretty cool though I think so they keep turning psych on suicide honey is that dreamy yeah I wrote it all and then I forgot what I wrote thank you Greg just sprinkled another I knew you I was about to spring Chloe and Max is like no oh really yeah it's like it's on that sheet over there oh the one that I prune it out that one okay it's like sometimes I write stuff down and then I'll forget to look at it I guess you learned it for me thank you welcome that's it you know I never got my forgetfulness from dad though yeah your study habits jerk about that in the basement where you'd be like yeah you have to leave a note for anything you know because you always tell yourself you'll remember then I was like yeah but then you see the note and you're like what's that for [Music] morgue ever since I did then remembered anything hey hey you beat me to it no that's wicked cold yeah let's go what is it [Music] 56 under 70 100 degrees under 50 signatures at under 70 it's a pretty big day you'll never know yeah well then you tell everybody a little get out yeah yeah messier than anything right so this will also get mixed up just both we're gonna [Music] it will get should win

"6D3cJxqWzj4": "hello and welcome to another episode of totally not Nigel I'm totally not Nigel your host today we're gonna be looking at the third in our series of eight episodes on clays old-fashioned hard candy we looked at the horehound flavor and the anise flavor and today we're going to be looking at green apple flavor that's right old-fashioned hard candy and down here they've got some old blurbs here they say that now you can enjoy that old-fashioned apple flavor and a delicious hard candy try some today so that's what we're going to do and the way we're going to do it is we're gonna open this up give it a smell give it a taste and then I'll let you know what I think so without any further ado let's get on the test now you may notice that Thanksgiving and Christmas are approaching in a not so subtle way by all the carols everywhere that you hear and all the bad Christmas music that they pump into every possible place in your life so um these might be good for setting out and having your houseguests come by and sample them we'll find out my sniffers because tearing these bags is difficult and might lead to little green candies I'm assuming your green combatants all over the floor and they are greens you can see right here OOP just like on the outside of the bag here kind of a color coding thing let's get these two smell let's have a nice green apple smell to them very bright yep a little bit of bagging smell in there too just it smells like the bag this is what they look like up close and personal they got a little dusting of sugary stuff on there which helps the medicine go down I've heard so here we go mmm-hmm it's got a very clean bright sour green apple kind of flavor to it right on the money that sugary coating just gives it that little extra bit of oomph and awesomeness but you're gonna want from a hard candy coming Christmas or Thanksgiving or any time of the year actually because I know these are available year-round but just saying you know time of year we're in you might you know slide some out there and see who likes something who doesn't mm-hmm yep very good just a moment and we're back so with that being done yes quite good highly recommend if you like green apple flavors you're gonna like this clays old-fashioned hard candy green apple flavor is a winner so two and a half winners out of three they're on a roll let's see what they do for tomorrow's flavor which will be watermelon yeah watermelon flavored hard candies should be a treat anyway that being said that's it for this particular episode of

and we will see you next time when we look at clay is watermelon hard candy should be fun [Music]", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "bBsBNrWbTzg": "welcome to spiced candies well in the previous video we did some chocolate spread candies and the guys that were complaining that this is not a specific brand they like well the brand they lack is a very known well famous brand of chocolate spread and see the logo over there and since I promised here is my new candy making from this specific spread as you can see it's very similar to the last one so if you have friends and family members kids you like to make some candies that's the way to go let's get started oh can use reached the right temperature this is on 50 degrees Celsius or in I think we're ready to pour [Music] and that's it let's cut it and since these are so thick you better cut them small now the Roma in the kitchen now is quite amazing I can assure you Oh our lollipops isn't farewell they're not fully cured because this is so thick I should have used larger lollipops for these even worse of this one it's missing half a wing it's sort of a well Nemo butterfly lollipop okay I'll let this cool off and we'll get cracking as soon as this is cold enough to touch our candy has cooled and we can break it well our lollipops is not fair well now there are 3d actually so I'll try that next on off-camera of course in general you don't want to pour lollipops are too thick right so just break it [Applause] [Music] right so these are candies so that's all there is to it hope you enjoy this in case you've been wondering this is just like the original you can feel on taste the original flavor of the spread and this chocolate is really nice even as a hard candy hope you enjoyed this have a sweet day and I'll see you soon", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of",

these\u00a0\nlittle cups here and i pour them in at once\u00a0\u00a0 all together once it reaches the 300 degree which\u00a0\nis crack candy stage and then i just um stir it\u00a0\u00a0 and it's done i don't know if i'm able to\u00a0\nshow you all that on here but let me try\u00a0\u00a0 this particular recipe i'm gonna use one whole\u00a0\nstick of butter two cups of sugar and maybe a half\u00a0\u00a0 a cup of corn syrup and see how that turns out the\u00a0\nmain thing is to get it into the crack candy phase\u00a0\u00a0 the first time i made myself call myself making\u00a0\nalcohol lollipops and i put too much alcohol they\u00a0\u00a0 turned out good and they did the job they actually\u00a0\ngot me tipsy but they were soft like toffee okay the butter's melting i'm gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and pour my corn syrup\u00a0\u00a0 that i have measured out already\u00a0\nhalf a cup and then the sugar um\u00a0\u00a0 i am using a stainless steel sauce pan i got it\u00a0\nfrom walmart for like 12 they say the best one to\u00a0\u00a0 use is aluminum and then the second best is copper\u00a0\nbut this one worked just as fine it worked perfect go ahead and put the sugar up and i'll\u00a0\nshow you when it comes the butter is\u00a0\u00a0 boiling let me get the sugar in\u00a0\nand then i'll show you that boil so you also must use a metal spoon go ahead and\u00a0\ngive that a stir real quick just because i want to\u00a0\u00a0 get that sugar dissolved so it can start boiling\u00a0\nup and then i'm going to check the temperature\u00a0\u00a0 i put the top on i'm gonna let it get the boil\u00a0\ngoing and um then we'll put the thermometer in\u00a0\u00a0 the digital thermometer and i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand get my flavoring and food colorings ready\u00a0\u00a0 i want to make two different color\u00a0\ncandies so i'm gonna after i get\u00a0\u00a0 this to a certain temperature\u00a0\nbefore i pour my flavoring in\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna actually pour half of this into\u00a0\nhere so that i can um you know get two flavors while that's some boiling up we'll go ahead\u00a0\nand put our sticks in this i'm gonna have to\u00a0\u00a0 use the smaller sticks i'm glad i got some oh\u00a0\nmaybe i need the smaller sticks for holidays\u00a0\u00a0 yeah let me get my small sticks one more got the\u00a0\nsticks in and on these i think i'm gonna put the\u00a0\u00a0 candy in first and then the stick as it starts\u00a0\nto harden these does not require stick let's go\u00a0\u00a0 check on the um boiling mixture so it's boiling\u00a0\nup and what you do is you don't stir it you just\u00a0\u00a0 let it boil but let's go ahead and um see what the\u00a0\ntemperature is i have to get it to at least 300. let's see how fast it's going to change\u00a0\nit's going fast it's 144 158 170 already 180\u00a0\u00a0 89 always getting on up there okay i'm gonna\u00a0\nlet it get to 300 and then i'm gonna separate\u00a0\u00a0 it let me get my flavors ready i didn't do that\u00a0\nyet but i'm about to but this is moving fast\u00a0\u00a0 okay someone made this with strawberry and the\u00a0\nsour tart and we're gonna put a little red in that\u00a0\u00a0 make some red candy i hope that's enough\u00a0\nand this we're gonna put a little green and at once once this reach let's check this again saying 95 let's check it see how fast it moves up and i wanted to burn you got to get\u00a0\nto about 300 that's going pretty fast let me turn the stove down a\u00a0\nlittle bit once that's all 247 when i get it with 300 guys because i'm\u00a0\nusing one hand oh it's getting up there\u00a0\u00a0 and i'll show you what on\u00a0\nhow i put these flavors in but anyway you get the idea let me get that stirred and i'll be back\u00a0\nand then we got to pour it in and the molds okay guys it definitely got the correct\u00a0\nstage um perfection it started like\u00a0\u00a0 like setting like hardening up\u00a0\nreally quick let me show you\u00a0\u00a0 first time i made it in get the heart cracks\u00a0\ncandy i can tell it did not because it has\u00a0\u00a0 all these little pieces that is hard and\u00a0\nstringy so i'm excited about this the flavor show you the end results before i show the\u00a0\nresults i just want to show you i'm gonna have\u00a0\u00a0 to figure out but these look pretty good these\u00a0\ncircles but i'm gonna have to figure out a way\u00a0\u00a0 to get this stuff in here smooth so i can have\u00a0\nmy proper shape i noticed that it works better\u00a0\u00a0 than the silicone mold i just tasted like\u00a0\npieces from the end guys and this is a very\u00a0\u00a0 very good flavor so if you want to ramp up\u00a0\nyour flavor and your hard candies add butter\u00a0\u00a0 along with flavors and sweet and tart otherwise\u00a0\nit'll just taste like sugar it'll be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 with different colors but it'll\u00a0\njust take like sugar and water so these are the final results and they\u00a0\ncame out really good as far as the texture\u00a0\u00a0 and the flavor came out amazing these are\u00a0\nthe first ones that i made with the alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 they didn't come out so pretty but they were\u00a0\nperfectly flavor i put them in a refrigerator\u00a0\u00a0 and they're a little bit harder but they still\u00a0\nend up being a toffee like texture before you\u00a0\u00a0 finish eating it but it's delicious and\u00a0\nyou can actually feel the alcohol in it\u00a0\u00a0 these definitely got to um crack\u00a0\ncandy stage the green is really good\u00a0\u00a0 but the um red i put a little bit too much flavor\u00a0\nin it that flavoring is really concentrated so you\u00a0\u00a0 have to be very very careful and light-handed\u00a0\nwith the flavorings but that tart sour that\u00a0\u00a0 you can be heavy-handed with it i really like the\u00a0\nflavor of the green but i'm getting better at it thank you all for watching please\u00a0\nlike share and subscribe and have\u00a0\u00a0 a wonderful day night evening morning\u00a0\nwhatever time you're in at the moment", "A1L3UNm2bsk": "welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays confection in Tallahassee Florida today we're going to make some strawberry image candy we've poured our flavored hutt sugar out into our candy Cohen's bedroom this table was made over 150 years ago in Hartfield Connecticut and we're now adding food coloring for our palate we're going to use green for the top of the strawberry yellow for the background and the seeds and of course red for the strawberry the strawberry shape that we make is a good example of how we design our image can we're not going for an exact image going clues that your brain is together making image in this case let's look at a strawberry it has yellow seeds that a little vertical specks it is a red background that has green on the top and we're going to take all of those elements and when we make the final product it's not going to look exactly like a strawberry but your brain will see it as such the white powder you see is citric acid that we've added to give that little sour lemon strawberry taste like strawberry we're about to cut apart the sugar and the edges that have been touching the metal are now cooled down to a point that we can touch them they're actually to cool but the center is still over 300 degrees we're going to cut our palate apart into pieces and then we're going to fold it together to get the temperature to be even in each of our colors an Arizona where the Batman you hope the yellow on the hook to make it an opaque yellow the room where the pastel and we've separated our colors we have green on one side waiting to become leaves and we've got the red separated into T hearts one part is going to become the seeds and if we made into a cylinder the other part is going to be saved wrap this one cylinders would be multiplied into all the seeds it's too large right now to use but when we stretch it will become smaller in diameter we'll cut it apart and you'll make it to strawberry syncopated again let the here the fellows come the Western Sun you can see us make the scandium person in Tallahassee Florida and lofty pursuits we do it right in front of everyone and that's why we call the public displays confection you can also buy our candies online or if you go to WWE at our website you can even request for custom candies to be made we make custom candies for all occasions from weddings to anniversaries to any special event we even make it with corporate logos while Greg rotates the triangular shape for the body of the strawberry maggie starts the frog she'll make the spacers that are triangles out of the yellow this is actually the harder part of the tron and then greg will use the green candy to add stripes which will become the fron itself they add letter by you by love for you is true on account of you kid they are letter by make sure my love Oh hey out of mine ready the background rat was stretched to size and log is assembled waiting for it out around the artwork in the center of the log was cooled to a lower temperature than the RAM we are going to be rolling this back and forth for a bit to equalize the temperature Maggie during this time we'll be making the outer wrap and she'll be making this with a green stripe the green stripe is there mostly because we have leftover green we don't want to waste the sugar and the outer design sometimes changes depending on what colors we have left and how much candy we've used we have to keep the log of candy moving at all times it'll distort under its own weight because it's still soft and we stretch the log into rods which then get rolled on the candy cooling table to cool down once again if we don't keep them moving they'll go flat or they'll cool all that's left is to take the rods candy and cut them to their individual bite sized pieces you can subscribe to

to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida today we're going to make some pink grapefruit image candy with me and Marky and we're gonna talk about the history of pink grapefruits because it's humid we heated the sugar a little hotter than normal it's about 315 to 320 degrees and it's already flavored with pure grapefruit oil and yes you can get oil out of a grapefruit Marky is pouring this hot sugar mixture onto our cooling table which is a giant steel heatsink it's going to drop the temperature a whole lot and change it from a liquid into a semi solid so he can start sculpting it into the artwork that will be the final candy mark he and I take turns adding color to the hot sugar solution I'm adding pink and he's adding yellow the yellow will be the skin of the grapefruit the pink will be the inside wedges we've got to do this before the candy cools down on this cooling table if Zuma gets dropped quickly because soon it will be in a shape that we can sculpt it into its final artwork if you look carefully when we stir you'll see that steam is coming off and the candy solution is boiling the sugar itself is pure sugar there's nothing to boil in there but it's so hot any water in the food coloring boils out almost immediately and turns to steam and this is good because we leave the moisture in there the candy would be sticky in its final product [Music] grapefruits are sour and that's what this white powder is it's pure citric acid going in and that's gonna make the candy nice and sour so that it tastes like a grapefruit now we have to separate our artists palette of colors clear pink and yellow and we're going to separate them and let them cool even more by letting them drip you see the inside of this candy is very hot where it didn't touch the metal but where it touched the metal it is cooled off almost to the point of being solid we need to have urge this out and turn it into something with the consistency of a stiff clay over the years people have asked me what the favorite flavor of candy that I make is and the answer is grapefruit and I realized I've never made a grapefruit video before now grapefruit we don't sell separately we sell as part of our assortment pack it's a citrus assortment pack of orange grapefruit lime and lemon not only is this a delicious assortment but it's also a great way to train a new candy maker as they're all the same and design so there's a lot of repetition and repetition will make smoky and excellent sugar Smith's over time you may have noticed we only put the citric acid in the white that's not a problem you see the white is gonna be in every piece of candy and it's gonna hit your tongue and your tongue doesn't have endpoint accuracy on where the taste is so as long as we get the right amount of acid in every piece it's gonna taste just like you want it to but we need to make part of it white and the citric acid being white itself hides beautifully in the white and we do this by pulling the candy on the hook this is both a harder skill and a hotter skill to master than most people think and here goes marque as he's going to do a beautiful job with it this is just about his first time soloing doing this [Music] we sell our grapefruit online as part of our citrus assortment which includes lime lemon orange and grapefruit and you can get that on our website too w WP e D net and check out the website there are all sorts of cool things there to ever come through Tallahassee Florida please come and visit we're open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. we don't make candy all the time but we have brunch in the morning and serve ice cream in the evening and if you're lucky you can catch us making candy because we do make a lot of candy there we're going to start building the art for the grapefruit and we're gonna do this with six pink wedges one wedge for each ledge of the grapefruit marquee and I shaped the grapefruit wedges and let them cool just a little bit so that they'll hold their shape I pull the white and I picked my strength against the candy this will be a line stretching across the diameter of the grapefruit grapefruits have their start in the Western Hemisphere but their ancestors did not they are a cross between a Jamaican sweet orange which is actually an ancient variety and a pomelo which comes from Barbados it probably started as a naturally occurring hybrid it came to North America in 1823 here in Florida in a town known as safety harbor it didn't originally go by grapefruit either it went by Shattuck or shoptalk until sort of in the mid 19th century when it changed a grapefruit because the fruits unlike most citrus forming bunches around the tree or at least that's what the documentation says I have a 40-foot grapefruit tree in the backyard of my house and on a good year I get 200 grapefruits and on a bad year I get 800 grapefruits and I gotta tell you these things don't seem to clump together in more than bears on my tree and then in Texas the first pink grapefruit was found naturally and it became extremely popular and they discovered if they did some breeding they can get some that were absolutely blood-red but unfortunately in a short time they faded back to pink they solved this problem by exposing the trees to radiation yes some cesium it seems and the radiation locked in the red mutation this may make the red grapefruit the first genetically modified organism end up on our supermarket shelves and this is why we make our candy grapefruits make now we built one giant piece of candy and we have to mass-produce it down to about four or five thousand pieces and we do this by scaling it we first have to get a little narrower here as we convert the log into rods [Music] Marky's scales down the candy on the batch roller this big metal machine makes this a little easier it keeps the candy spinning you see it's still sort of a liquid and if we leave it still it will go flat under its own weight by spinning it like this we get to keep it in a round shape and keep the image we've worked so hard on from distorting we now have two things going on and one is our patreon page and thank you

will be doing voice overs, and JESSICA! will be doing the close captioning. Which will be cooler. I'm going to be making some purple roses \nbe part of a Valentine's Day spring assortment The purple is only one color that I've made for this assortment. We will also have orange, pink, dark red, yellow, \nblue, white and of course purple roses. And you get to here Gregs voice while I type this for you :) The sugar is poured. Yes it's hot. 310 F/ 154C since Greg never uses the metric system. For some reason we use metric for fluid measurements and standard system for everything else. The green is for the leaves, the purple for the flower itself. Notice I use the back of the spoon for the green. I use the front for the purple. Smaller area to stir, smaller end of the spoon. Oh and the spoons are wood. People keep thinking I'm using plastic spoons. that's silly, they would melt. Why would we do that? I've used some white food coloring here, I want the purple to be more opaque without pulling it. This will let me get two shades of purple. I'll need this to make the petals visible. Mind you I used clear for the white and yellow roses because I thought it would look better. You can actually feel the bubbling of the food coloring with the spoon. This gives you an idea of if its mixed or not. Now to use the flat spatula to break the suction of the candy against the table. I love how people call these our big scissors. We actually use a bigger pair for the really big batches. I'm starting with the smallest color section since it can cool faster, I want it off the table first. And I let the hot bits of the candy drip.i can hold it by the cool edges that touched the bars. The liquid bit burns, and yes you get burned every-now and again making this kind of candy. Greg got a good burn on his finger when he burned a pot of sugar making the blue roses this week. Yes we use old equipment. The same stuff we say in every video. Yup, the table really is from 1891. There is a video on that. Yes, we use cool ingredients that taste better. Yes Greg likes the Victorian period a lot. I think he may like steam punk a bit too much. And he loves flowers.Did you know his mother is a botanical artist. She does great work. But I think Greg likes flowers more than most. But he's right Floriography was used by the Victorians to send messages. a bouquet of flowers could be used to send a specific message. They used a ton of flowers for this, but now, people only pay attention to the meanings of roses. And here is where the video is a little off.I pull the candy. But Greg got a new camera, so instead of two cameras. There are three, hes carrying one, and keeps getting int he way of the other cameras. At least he is editing this. I'm taking half the sugar and pulling it to make it lighter on this candy hook. And while it's harder to pull small batches of sugar, I left this bit a bit hotter to make it easier to do. And now Greg will quote Shakespeare. Hamlet about Ophelia and flowers. I never know if he has to look this up or just knows this off the top of his head. Shakespeare does use flowers for symbolism, but I notice in this case he does not use a rose. He does in Romeo and Juliet ... I'd think that was obvious. \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet\" a great quote for sweet roses that I'm making. but no ... not in this video. For this video is Hamlet. Ok, it's done. The book on Floriography linked in this description is fairly good. Mind you I did not know the symbolism of the yellow rose back in Victorian times. I wonder if Greg saw this, if he did I bet he would not have made yellow roses. Now to make a two toned purple spiral of candy. This will be the center of the rose So there is lots of symbolism in roses. White represents purity Red passion Rose buds mean secrets as they are closed. Pink for adoration Yellow now means platonic love. But you can mix colors together.  A red and white Rose together mean unity. and Purple means love at first sight. Which is nice. Now time to make the leaves. I need to let them cool to keep their shape. And now to put them aside and to make the petals. This will be two shades of purple. And I want the darker highlight color to be in the center. this will define the different pedals. I've kept the sugar hot enough that it sticks easily. These grooves are something I came up with.it adds a lot of texture to the petals when the flower is made. It makes the flower look less cartoon like, which is how Greg first made the rose. One of the cool things of candy making is bringing other skills to it. Greg is a good artist, but I am a classically trained baker and chef. Cake decorating skills are great here. You might not know this, but when I applied for this job, I was already watching the videos. Now I'm in them. And here are the petals with the grooves. I'm going to apply them to the spiral I made in alternating layers. For a rose they need to be a bit random, not too random as flower petals are in a spiral But perfection is making it a little imperfect, or it looks too much like a drawing.

Oh Greg and his doubleyous. The purple is fairly cool, the clear is hot, it will all average out well. And I've kept the heat just right so it sticks. Greg got a new camera, so he's having fun here. Usually he shoots with cameras on tripods But he now has a steady cam, and is using it a lot. I'm not sure, but I think this means there will be more videos of me so he can operate the cameras. You know YouTube uses voice to text to make subtitle on it's own. But sometimes it does not do a great job. So here I am. I wonder if Greg is correct here ... That Floriography is sort of the emoji of the Victorian period. He even used Emoji correctly :) and the flavors of these roses are meant to be combined. Cherry (Dk Red) and Marshmallow Cream (White) for unity will taste great. Strawberry and Banana are amazing for Yellow and Pink I'm surprised he did not use the joke from \"When Harry met Sally\" for the Hieroglyphics reference. Watch the film. Instead he's got a emoji poop reference. Well I did make some unicorn droppings. Now its time to cut the candy. I make the lengths shorter with this tool. Greg likes to cut long rods. I usually cut four at a time.It makes sense, the more rods I do at a time the sooner everything is cut. Or five rods at a time. And here is the purple rose. One of seven different colors and flavors by the time we were done. And hopefully they will all go to good homes. If this ends up popular enough we may make them again.

I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "at0kMnzgvRU": "hey guys it's me Madison

give it a thumbs up subscribe subscribe", "WMjjy8RZsGE": "hello I'm Doug and this is the taste insensibility channel and today on black licorice review number 20 we're looking at Gilliam's old-fashioned sanzu drops whatever that means we're also looking at Albert Ian albiric young candy drops that have words on it in Italian that make me take mints and licorice so that's what we're looking at today if you like the black licorice reviews that you've been seeing here on this channel please give this video a thumbs up please subscribe to the channel please click that don't like on to get notified whenever new ones are released Mondays and Thursdays so on the front that makes it look like why they should stick must be licorice roots on the front okay so it's licorice treats that's what the  it is so this is gonna be interesting and different usually I just speed up the tuning when I do the editing but honestly sucking or licking these little hard candies so I guess through the magic of editing you won't really see much of that here it goes little sugary coating on the outside getting here that hard candy knocking around on my teeth I am getting it hints of some anise flavor no aroma in the bag so either it's not anise or the acid really volatile it's going to talk to my sugary candy now that I really get into it it's a bit more bitterness that's making me think it might be liquorice extract and so it's very subtle and even though I'm not sucking on a hard candy it's not overly sweet it's not like a big wad of sugar even though probably it's just a big wad of sugar so the bitterness or the licorice flavor is counter balancing the sweetness of the sugar pretty well so this is a mild flavor people have done like licorice might be able to tolerate this it's kind of a rootbeer quality to it also bouncing around between three or four notes the licorice extract with bitterness and a little anise sometimes and root beer or something okay so I don't need to do another one I just scrunch up this when I move on okay so I'm going to find the RIP in the bag here and dump out a couple of these meter fairly similar not the mince makes it quite a difference I'm gonna burn all flavor profile okay quite a few things ahead minutes and licorice in them both some teas or like that I think I've had other candies so and these aren't just plain little balls or drops they have have some sort of fruity shape or leaf or something kind of x-gen to a mold so here goes the minty licorice from Italy oh wow nice rich flavor it's minty but it doesn't jump out and overwhelm everything I can't tell if it's licorice or anise flavor we see a pink beating us hope show Garrick wake us up essential oil of Chanukah larry mint extract of liquorice tank now anise that's a nice a fist to cated adult kind of candy the mint is subtle the licorice is subtle but it's still rich and flavorful and a good combination so I'm thinking things would function pretty well as cough drops or something to keep your mouth busy while you're listening to something or sitting waiting for things to happen in some context these are fairly interesting and this one's more interesting than this one I found this at a Cracker Barrel this line Gillian law old-fashioned candies is a whole line of different flavors they're all pretty much artificial and I was thinking not very interesting and this one I found out of Italy in New York City so I went to the candy section to look for licorice flavored things and found quite a few so this is the hard candy which is quite a bit different than the other licorice candies so that's why these two are together here I kind of just had two hard candies in the title this drop is going away slowly I don't want to crunch it up it's a nice flavor so I'll just keep it rattling around in my mouth as I sign off we will get back to black chewy candy like most of these things back up here in the next review so those stay tuned for that and come back for more you", "GkvKAKLpuqI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen Johns welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be doing another homemade candy recipe I've been having lots of fun making homemade candy and this one is super fun to play with and eat now I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade saltwater taffy so what we're going to be making is a bubble gum this is the one I've got going on right now and we're also going to do birthday cake funfetti and we're going to do cotton candy so like I said I have lots of homemade candy ideas up I'll put the playlist in the description box for you for that now let's get started on this tutorial to make our taffy we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of butter we're going to use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and we need 1/2 of a cup of water it can just be at room temperature we need 1 cup of granulated sugar we need 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to need a quarter to half a teaspoon of sea salt so that's our taffy base now to make it bubblegum flavor we're going to be using a little bit of pink gel paste and one DRAM of bubble gum candy flavoring so I've got a pot here and I've got my corn syrup already in it so you just want to make sure you've got that a nice big pot because the candy will bubble up so I'm going to put all of my ingredients into the pot here and at any point you can turn your heat up to a medium high now when you're making candy probably the most important part is to make sure that you do get it to the proper temperature so I'm going to be using a candy thermometer to do so and what I'm going to be looking for is a temperature put around 255 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm just going to pop in some of my color now and a little bit of the I'm going to drop this whole DRAM in that's what one of these little things is called so I'm putting that all flavoring of that bubblegum in there turning my temperature up and then I'm going to a stir it while I've got it here on the pot and once I've got this all stirred and the butter has melted I'll put my can a thermometer in at that point so once the butter has melted and everything has been mixed together nicely you're going to take your candy thermometer and you just want to set it into the pot and we're going to wait until it gets to 255 degrees that's gonna make nice and chewy toffee and it will still be like like melts in your mouth pretty much you can do it a little bit heart hotter if you want to about 260 to 265 if you want it to be a little bit firmer when the toffee has come to temperature you can remove the thermometer and then down here beside my pot I have a buttered dish here and it's just a cake pan or like a bread pan I'm going to take my hot toffee and I'm going to pour it into my pan and then I'm going to let it cool until I'm able to handle it once the candy has cooled to a temperature that you can handle it just peel it out of your pan and it will should still be a little bit warm because you want to be able to work it and so I'm just gonna move that out of the way so we've got a nice big chunk of taffy here and you can see that the color is still just kind of like that clear look but what we're going to do is we're going to pull it so I'm just pulling it apart and putting it back together so just see we're gonna completely just keep pulling and pulling and pulling for about 15 minutes you get a lovely far forearm workout from this and what this is doing is putting some air into it so we're aerating the candy and the color is going to change and it's going to become a nice kind of like opaque pink so we're just going to pull and Bowl and Bowl until I've got to the it all pulled and you'll also know that when you've reached that kind of like the end that it will be that light color and it will be really difficult for you to pull at that point so when you're done pulling your taffy will be really stiff and it's going to be shiny and a nice light opaque you can see how the color completely changed and then what you want to do is just kind of pull it into a rope or just bite-size like kind of what you want to your bite-size pieces to be and then I'm going to take buttered scissors and I'm we're just going to cut pieces out into whatever size you can roll them up into a ball or whatever shape you want to do whenever you're doing with the taffy you want to make sure that everything is buttered like my gloves are buttered and the scissors are buttered I've just got a piece of wax paper here that I've rolled up and I'm just going to pinch the ends and roll the ends and then that's how you can serve your candy so to make our cotton candy taffy we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of butter we need 1 tablespoon of a corn starch and what I'm going to add in is some of the blue cotton candy and you can just probably go to a cup of it it's totally optional if you can't find it or you can make your own we need 1/2 a cup of water we need 1 cup of granulated sugar 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to be using 1/2 of a teaspoon of sea salt and this is pretty much the same recipe as our taffy base from our bubblegum but to make it the cotton candy we're going to add a little bit of the blue and we're going to add some cotton candy flavoring so we've got a large pot again and I've got the corn syrup already in there and I'm going to take out just the blue you could put in the pink cotton candy as well if you really wanted to I just want to kind of stay with that color theme so I'm gonna pop a little bit of some blue gel paste you could also use regular food coloring if you want some cotton candy flavoring smells deliciously sweet and some of course more sugar what else is cotton candy than sugar and we've got our sea salt and some water and while I've got this mixing you'll see that it just disintegrates like that beautiful color turn up your heat to about medium-high and add everything else in as well and then I'm just going to mix everything together and then pop my candy thermometer in once my butter has melted and I'm going to heat it to 255 Fahrenheit once the candy has come to temperature you can remove the thermometer and I'm just popping it into like a hot water tall vase and then take the candy and you're going to pour it into a buttered bread pan or anything flat you want to make sure that it is heat proof though you don't want to put it into anything plastic because obviously the candy is extremely hot at this point and make sure you don't touch it either so I'm going to let this cool until we can pull it so I've buttered my gloves and I've let the candy cool so I can handle it just using a spatula or a spoon or something you can grab that taffy out of the pan and then all we're going to do again is just pull and stretch it till it comes a nice blue color and we're going to do that for about 15 to 20 minutes once we pulled the taffy completely we can take buttered scissors and cut off our pieces it's super satisfying to cut it the taffy has changed into a beautiful pastel color then you're going to take a piece of wax paper and just put the taffy into the center of it and then taking a small piece of cotton candy I'm using the pink cotton candy now because I want that different color and I'm just going to wrap it up and then serve it with this little piece of cotton candy it's going to add extra flavor and it adds that little extra pop of color as well so just twist the wax paper around and then your taffy is ready to serve so to make our third kind of taffy we're going to be doing funfetti so we're going to need one tablespoon of butter and we're using our standard recipe here for the taffy so we've got 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of water and then I've got some wonderful colorful jimmies here you can use any kind of sprinkles that you want too I've got 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to be using some clear vanilla extract if you want to make it vanilla birthday cake flavor that's what I'm going to be doing to make it that nice cool funfetti and we're going to need 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and we need some sea salt and I've got half a teaspoon so I've got my corn syrup here in my pot and I'm going to take 1 tablespoon of the vanilla extract and I'm going to pour that into there as well turn my temperature up to medium-high and just like with all the other recipes I'm going to add in my ingredients so I've got my sugar there and my sea salt and my water now you can add in coloring like we did for the other varieties if you want to this one I was going to leave with kind of like the vanilla coloring to it and pop in that butter and then just give it a stir and again we're heating it to 255 degrees Fahrenheit once our funfetti taffy has come to temperature I'm going to take my pot pour it into my buttered dish again so get all of that good stuff in there and then I'm going to take my sprinkles and I'm just going to sprinkle them gently on top and you want to do it before the taffy sets and you want to make sure that they're sprinkled on top of here and they'll just like kind of move around and then we're gonna wait again for it to solidify and be able to be handled once the funfetti toffee has cooled we can dig it out with a spatula and then we are going to pretty much mix the sprinkles in at this part at this point and then what we're going to do is it is going to aerate and is going to change color and we'll have a beautiful funfetti color to it we're going to pull it for about 15 minutes once we're finished pulling you'll see it's nice and light and you can see those awesome chunks of sprinkles in there I used the jimmies that I did just because I find that when I'm making cakes with the jimmies that these ones don't run in color and I really definitely didn't want the color to run here I wanted to make sure that we had a regular kind of white look to it so if you're going to wrap these ones up you don't have to wrap the saltwater taffy up but it does kind of add that authentic look to it and I'm just going to add a couple of extra sprinkles into the little package here and then just roll it up with the little wax paper and twist the ends and we've got our saltwater funfetti taffy so I'm gonna be back to tell you what I kind of thought general opinion of all three different flavors so there you go everybody how to make salt water taffy with three different flavors now the cotton candy one was definitely delicious with that additional cotton candy chunk that I put in and the funfetti was my favorite looking one at looks like a birthday cake how fun is that and the bubble gum one I could have taken her leaving it but the bubble gum is always everybody loves bubble gum flavor right so but I would have gone with the funfetti if I could only choose one let me know in the comments which one you think you would like the best and I also want to know which candy do you want me to try making next time I love making the homemade candies so give me a suggestion thanks so much for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys all again next time", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "uHNDsUfjSnc": "[Music] how to make homemade hard candy these days you can buy candies by the bulkan groceries supermarkets and nearby convenience stores but what you are probably not aware of is the fact that you can make your own hard candy at home given the right ingredients in some tools and equipment that you probably already have in your kitchen you can add these old-fashioned hard candies to your gift baskets for a change instead of just putting cupcakes and pastries in them if you are ready to make your own candies at home here are the steps on how to make homemade hard candy 1 prepare the following ingredients and equipment 2 cups of sugar 3/4 cup of hot water 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 1/8 tsp flavoring of your choice food coloring 1 large saucepan 1 candy thermometer greased cookie sheet or candy molds kitchen scissors to make sure that you have the proper temperature for making candies it is crucial to create homemade hard candies in optimal temperatures that is around 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit with low humidity your candy will not turn out successfully if the weather is too hot or extremely humid and rainy even your altitude can affect the outcome of the candy you may need to make adjustments if you live in a high altitude area if you have suboptimal temperature conditions you may want to compensate by cooking the candies 1 to 2 degrees higher than what is recommended in the recipe 3 combine the corn syrup sugar and water in the large saucepan stir the ingredients over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved which takes about 5 minutes afterwards you can leave it alone and let it boil for another five minutes to ensure even heating it is best to do this on a burner that is wider than the saucepan you are using for once your mixture is boiling raise the heat to high to make sure that you are hitting the right temperature attach a candy thermometer to the saucepan however make sure that the thermometer does not touch the base of the saucepan and your pan must be tall enough so that the thermometer does not reach its bottom when hung on the pan lip if you do not have a candy thermometer you may get a glass of ice-cold water to use as your gauge 5 right before the mixture reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit add the food coloring and flavoring to the mixture you do not need to stir the mixture as the boiling action is enough to thoroughly incorporate the color and flavor 6 when the mixture reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit remove it from the high heat immediately or it will burn if you do not have a candy thermometer drop a tiny bit of the candy mixture into the glass of ice cold water if the drop solidifies and floats to the surface then your mixture has reached the required temperature it is okay if the temperature in the saucepan continues rising as long as you were removed it from the heat 7 pour the mixture onto a greased cookie sheet and spread it around the sheet be quick as it will be hard to spread the mixture once it cools down if you want to give your candies a consistent shape you may pour the mixture in candy molds or mini muffin pans do not refrigerate as it will make your candies harden too quickly 8 wait for 30 minutes to an hour for the candy to harden if you used a cookie sheet cut the candy into several pieces using kitchen scissors 9 store the homemade hard candies and paper bags or metal tins learning how to make homemade hard candy is best done during the cold season as it complies with the optimal temperature for making candies during the holiday season you can also wrap these candies individually and include them as part of your gift baskets for your loved ones [Music]", "4gejrRaXpdo": "welcome to spiced candies we're making something else this is a spread my chocolate chip spread in the form of a hard candy and this is the original material so let's get started I'll show you how I made these [Music] yeah my old camera is tricking on me so it more or less kept the same shading it has a candy now a spread anymore so I can't expect it to be identical not to mention it's been diluted with sugar so let cool off and a Z Phil take these candies as a compensation for the missing chocolate chip spread okay see you in a second right let's try and break these still warm to touch [Music] so if spongebob likes his squeaky what was that cucumbers I think then this is my favorite part breaking the candies so I think they're ready oops forgot about these but I won't taste them now it's already midnight and I want to hit the sack so let's move these into a nicer container thank you for watching hope you enjoyed I'll definitely write below what my opinion was on these once I taste these and post the video of course I do think these are cute not easy to make because they're quite problematic when it comes to mixing the chocolate chip cookies spread in there although I think they're okay I think they're quite nice they're definitely rigid rigid let's stick to these and they're so very warm they haven't cooled to room temperature and you can hear that so I think these are more or less ready I'll give it a shot try these and let you know how they did so thank you for watching hope you enjoyed and have a sweet day", "AaGHDrI4EEM": "do you remember the old-fashioned candy with all the bright colors and cool images well I do and I thought they were beautiful to look at very Christmasy put you in this season but you know what they never really tasted that good these are handmade candies and it takes a lot of work to get those images in place seems like all they need to do is upgrade their flavoring and add some citric acid then they'd be delicious well unless you're making cinnamon or peppermint I don't know maybe I've only had the cheap kind because I'm looking in this magazine and these look fancy so I decided since it's my birthday month I'm going to order just random things that I wanted to try and I've watched this YouTube channel called lofty pursuits for a couple of years and it's always interesting to watch how he makes this image candy so I thought you know what I'm gonna order me a couple of these packages to see how they taste it took about three weeks for the package to get here and just when I thought they might have lost my order it showed up in my mailbox and of course I had to start digging right in because I was really curious about this package it's called Thanksgiving leftovers and it's supposed to taste like Thanksgiving food and that is very strange so I had to try it each 2.75 ounce bag costs $5.99 and they come with one of these fresh packets to keep the candy from getting sticky this package is the variety pack and I thought it was a good idea to get this one because then I can try all the different flavors and look at all the cool designs they come in different shapes and sizes somewhere kind of skinny and some are a little bit wider they start out hard in your mouth and then they dissipate where you can crunch them without hurting your teeth that's because of the air that is incorporated into a portion of the candy when he pulls it on the candy hook this one looks like a mug of root beer and I believe this one is a tutti frutti he adds citric acid to a lot of his fruit flavors and it really amps up the flavor and he won't know this one is called police Fox and it was inspired by Doctor Who and it looks like a little TARDIS inside this is a yummy raspberry flavor ignore my fingernails I teach elementary school and I just do my best these are black currant drops and I haven't tried black currant before I don't think but anyway these turned out to be my favorite it was the Thanksgiving leftovers that actually made me bite the bullet in order from lofty pursuits this time couldn't imagine how you could make Thanksgiving food tastes good in a candy so we're gonna try these he made a bunch of image candy and it was so successful that it sold out so quickly that he made it into drop form and he calls them leftovers to be sold after Thanksgiving this one was either cranberry or apple pie and it has sort of a cinnamon eat flavor there's also a merlot in there some I think this one was the buttered corn and it tasted okay it had a buttery flavor with a touch of corn this one I'm pretty sure was peach cobbler can't really go wrong with peach cobbler this one is honey baked ham and yes it tastes like you're sucking on a piece of ham and it sort of lingers in your mouth for a while too I didn't like it at first but it kind of grew on me this one has to be the pecan pie and it was really sweet and caramel II it was okay I guess but this one had to been the stuffing and I could not even finish this one I think it had garlic in it and celery powder I don't know if I got all the flavors that were available but I think this one was a sweet potato casserole and my husband recognized it right away and he liked it so that was kind of a fun little adventure for the taste buds I put them in a candy jar with a couple fresh packets and they didn't really last that long because we ate them pretty quickly so a big thumbs up for lofty pursuits these are fun beautiful colors and some wonderful flavors so I highly recommend thanks for watching", "AWqTWDBveMc": "what's up guys my name is mike and this is caitlin hi today we're going to be trying five different flavors of cotton candy now it's going to be a game we don't know any of the flavors of the cotton candy and the loser has to eat carolina reaper cotton candy now first up i'm not really sure what it is but it looks pretty good um i'm gonna see a bit of peace jesus it feels good it feels a lot better than just like cotton candy that you'd get from like a like a fair or something yeah like it doesn't feel like light and like it's dense i don't know this one's oh wow this one's good at first it was like super sweet and then it's like a little nutty the aftertaste is kind of spicy yeah the aftertaste just hates you in the throat but it's like a good like like i could eat like a ton of that it's almost like a chili yeah like a chili you really taste it like after the spiciness after let's see what do you think it is some sort of chili flavor it's like i don't know it's like sweet and then it can't just be like normal i mean now i'm gonna say chili like some sort of chili like um like it tastes like um like what are those peanuts called honey like honey roasted peanuts with like some chili on it yeah yeah yeah are we right close it's pecan green chili okay okay well hey that was pretty that was still pretty like close it was like a little sweet you can definitely taste the chili yeah definitely taste the chili it's like really freaking good um all right up next is this this one is like an orange flavor i noticed that the flavors are kind of so yeah so i'm like right now i'm thinking like maybe like orange or peach i'm gonna get a nice big chunk of that it smells good oh totally different way different super good i'm glad i got a little extra yeah it's like a little citrusy like i'm telling you guys this was like amazing yeah i think this one's my favorite so far like i can only eat so much cotton candy like i could probably eat like like a stick of it like if i got to like the bear or some or you see like those vending machines like in the mall i don't know if anybody's ever seen those but sometimes cotton candy's like too much but this is like addicting it's like and it's not too sweet it's like just the mouth it doesn't feel like i just ate a spoonful of sugar like yeah it actually has like it's got a really good flavor to it and the texture is nice yeah like it's crazy but it's like i don't know i'm gonna say like man i don't wanna say orange but i'm gonna say orange it tastes like orange it's like i don't know what you think like an orange tangerine type dill it tastes really good like it has a nice aftertaste too it's like i just drink some like gum it's like refreshing in a way can i get like can i get a guess breakfast breakfast maybe uh sparkling a little sparkling a little orange juice mimosa there you go oh yeah all right up next is this one and it's just it's white it's like clear i mean it smells good i wonder what this means i'm just getting my hands all up in there thank you whatever look at that oh it smells sweet see and you can tell like the quality of this like it's not i mean i've seen cotton candy like this like oh i mean look it still well that one's really sweet right and look like you know cotton candy just melts on your tongue like it actually has some sort of consistency wow that one's really sweet oh my god um huh this one's definitely definitely like a maple flavor in there at first it's sweet i taste like like a smoky like a smoky like yeah like a beef jerky almost yeah there's like a sweetened smokiness to it but the aftertaste is like i don't know now i've had like cotton candy that tastes like like meat like bacon cotton candy but it's been like oh my gosh like terrible we went to the dollar store went to the dollar store and i'm sorry my window is open and it's the wind is insane but don't mind that um but i've had bacon cotton candy and it tastes like like dog food like it's gross it's really freaking nasty they sell at the dollar store if you get it try it it's terrible um but it's just like i don't know it's good it tastes like it's sweet but it's got like a smoky flavor yeah it actually tastes like i don't want to say like it tastes like bacon but like it's not like it doesn't taste like artificial like a maple bacon like it doesn't taste like movie bacon it tastes like bacon like if you just went home and cooked some bacon and you ate it it's really good like that's what it tastes like does it make your face make a baby okay i got that one yeah that one is good yeah that one is really good it sounds gross but it's actually pretty good let's see up next this is another just plain white looks like the stuff that would be in my pillow it's nice and fluffy this one is very fluffy this one smells good is this one can we just eat this one no no this one's definitely different i don't know what this one is is it it's spicy what i don't know you don't taste it it's got it's got a little bit of spice dude you're crazy no i'm serious you're lying i'm not lying i need another piece maybe i just fell off there's like a tiny bit of spice to it like get a smaller piece and like put it in your mouth oh it's spicy like a little bit not like okay i just got a totally different piece like huh hold up it's not unbearably spicy but there's a little bit he's eating all the cotton candy shut up i don't know what it is i really have no idea what this one is huh it is spicy yeah and it's spicy not like it's not like spicy spice there's like a hint of spiciness to it it's like i never got like some tahini and like put it on the lime like is it like a chili another chili one watermelon lime chili okay oh okay that makes sense i think there's like i don't know i thought i could really taste something i got one and i was like huh yeah i wonder are we even keeping track of coins she did the she had the maple one and then she had the chili lime one i think they're almost like neck all right let's try this one the pretty pink color cotton candy this one definitely looks like just your og cotton candy like you know what does it taste like i know right now yeah original has to be original or like the regular cotton candy flavor it just tastes like um like traditional yeah cotton candy i'm not sure what the flavor is but definitely just like yeah it's like i don't know it just tastes like it tastes like cotton candy but like like the flavor is more intense like everything is like what i've noticed with these cotton candies is everything is more flavorful it's more intense yeah like compared to the ones you buy in the store there's not as much flavor as this one yeah yeah so next video blindfold taste test comparison store-bought cotton candy versus sugar drips cotton candy and we're gonna see if we notice any difference right now i'm noticing a difference yeah but i don't want to be biased but i'm going to definitely say this is like an original flavor yeah it's bubblegum okay okay so we'll mark up your totals and then we'll get back yeah and we'll see who eats the yeah right now we gotta make it but everybody has a get out because it's so like deadly domain it's like breathing and pepper spray yeah yeah so beware but we're going to record the process of it and uh you know [Music] all right welcome back sorry for the little cut we had to make the cotton candy the [Music] is the ghost pepper it's the reaper right yeah the carolina carolina chili jesus i've had ghost pepper before i've never had carolina so hopefully it's not like you know gonna melt my freaking head off but supposedly i'm the loser i don't know how you should let me know who actually won i don't i don't think any of us won i'm gonna be the one eating it and if she wants to be nice then it's an honorable thing to do yeah yeah so i think we tied maybe if anything yeah i think there's a time going on yeah there's some time going on all right man you ready you're so scared you want to go first i want to be a gentleman i'll go first i'll be the i'll be the tough one oh that's how it is that's rude right off the bat this one's oh [Music] so at first it's not bad but then after you eat it it just starts getting more and more intense but it's good oh my god you had a big chunk too this is like insane like it's like really hard this is definitely hotter than ghost pepper by the way so if you guys any any of you guys had a ghost pepper before it's like worse than habanero serrano all of that out the window this is like like the devil just like ripped out my tongue and like shoved in his ass crazy hot it's like insanely are you eating more dude that was amazing this is really good you're on drugs dude that's she's burning me out of my tongue she's one of those people that just getting extremely hot chilly i like hot stuff sure that's good oh my god that's really good no no don't wipe your eyes or that yeah wash your hands yeah all right i'm gonna hit another piece thank you i will say it for a whole i will say at first definitely i definitely taste good but oh my gosh i'm like speechless this is like like i said at first it tastes like really good you can't taste it but after you're done you finish it eating it when you finish

not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give

y'all are super excited so white wait let's get into the video and check out the ingredients add 1/2 cup of sugar to a saucepan the NA juice of 3 lemon to it the quality of the juice will vary based on the size of the lemon the girl would do tablespoons lemon juice [Music] keep mixing the two ingredients until the sugar gets completely dissolved [Music] what the sugar is dissolved it is start to bubble up now some of the flame and keep mixing continuously it will take around 10 minutes to change its color so be patient and continue mixing now it just changed its color and have caramelized let's check if it's imperfect consistently in a bottle of water pour in a drop it should crystallize immediately now we have the perfect consistency so we are all good so after flame and let's start making the candies plays a butter paper on top of a boat and start pouring into small candies using a spoon make the candies immediately after you have the perfect consistent thing else it may thicken up you can alter the size of the candies based on your progress [Music] [Music] [Music] I love them to cool completely and form the candy crystals now our candies are ready so remove them from the butter paper and sell them to your kids I'm sure they would love it store them in an airtight container and you can enjoy this lemon candies for a month time do subscribe to our pink kitchen Channel

there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff love a piece of chicken grease", "skaG9PqceVI": "hey guys Maria is here so so sorry but my face I got antibiotics today guys because after swelling in me then this said I need it and I'm a health exam that is why I promise [Applause] yes [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] thanks for watching", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would

welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out

you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "SysslUhKwzE": "what is going on my peeps my name is David welcome back to this week's video god dammit my damn video now if you guys remember a few weeks ago when I made you this promise so it's gonna be between two to four plus videos per week yeah if you've been around here for any extended period of time you will know that I am NOT great at keeping the promises that I make sometimes although this one still has hope I'm just you know giving you a fair warning if I don't get two to four of this week but anyway some of you may remember that a long ways back I made jello Legos with these molds which did take me a couple of tries but they ended up looking okay and today I figured I should try to get more than one usage out of these $23 Lego molds I decided to take some inspiration from a tipsy bartender and all the other channels that have been doing shot glasses made out of Jolly Ranchers recently and use that same concept to make these Legos instead now there's a couple different ways that I'm considering doing these one of which I am assuming is going to come out the best but I will try a few so let's get right into it now if you are if you are out there that is more intelligent than the YouTube algorithm meaning that you have at least one brain cell and you make any amount of sense at all you would be able to assume that we need a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers for this project if this video gets taken down by YouTube you all know why but what I decided to do was to tump out the entire bag and to separate each of the five colors into their corresponding bulbs while also unwrapping each individual candy piece and this step is just about as fun as this time-lapse looks but once you complete that we can move on to the first method that I will be attempting and that is the double boiler method I've seen people melt down different types of hard candy like this before which is why I think that this might work so I've started with a few of the cherry flavoured because I tended to have the most of those and get even a while to melt down in the bulb and if you guessed that this was going to be a thick sticky mess than you were absolutely correct every single utensil I tried to use to stir this just did not work and got stuck everywhere the candy never really melts down completely to a liquid form it just stays really thick and the second you take it off the heat it thickens up even more so I tried my best to put the mixture in one of the little molds and let it cool down which as you can imagine was also at a C and a half but I guess when I took it out of the fridge it kind of worked a little bit but I think we can do a lot better for method number two all I did was stuffed each mold with different colors of the Jolly Ranchers I used four in each of these blocks which I'm hoping won't be too much or too little and once I had one of those molds completely filled I threw it in a 400 degree oven for about seven to eight minutes that's it for you if you're gonna try to make these things if you see a ton of bubbles in the top of the candy that means your oven is too hot or you left them in for too long but all you really have to do is just go in and try to pop them with a toothpick or a different sharp object just a little bit of extra work so avoid it is possibly but once I had done that that into the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes until it hardened up and these look a ton better they still didn't take perfect shape of the molds they really didn't get all the divots in it and you can kind of see the crevice where all the candy is kind of melted together so I made one more batch like that and they came out just about the same the last thing I want to try with these though is to do the same method but halfway through the baking process put another different mold on top so that way the divots from the top mold will hopefully melt down into the candy so you can stack them together I did a few batches with that method and they came out even better than the last one so I tried to build some stuff with them I tried to make a nice little candy staircase and I guess that came out pretty cool I tried to make a YouTube logo which came out pretty crappy if you ask me honestly and lastly I tried to build a wall with an accurate representation of the theoretical integrity of Donald Trump's [Applause] one last piece of advice I do not recommend being overly aggressive with these or dropping them from any sort of height because they're kind of fragile and will chip a lot being that they're hardened candies they're actually almost on par with being just as fragile as a drama channel's YouTube career but I hope you enjoyed this week's DIY if

shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an o avi and II a why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim", "zQ0tOmlX4xc": "hi guys Lee here from FX I

and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be putting um these candies drilling ranchers into this silicone molds silicone mold and um we're gonna melt them and um we're gonna put it back in the fridge we're gonna put them in the fridge every night yeah and then um we'll show you the finished hard candies yeah so let's get on with it okay so the first thing that you will need to get get or do is so you'll get a plastic bag and the first jolly ranchers you know that a little goes a long way that's what we're gonna be doing so you're gonna put the jolly ranchers in there without the raptor my mom's gonna get a hammer so we can smash it so first jelly wrench you're going in and that's the first jolly roger in we have a mammoline a blueberry i can't open this without touching it i don't want to edit it but you're the one that's going to be eating them so it's going to be okay so we have the first ones in here you're going to want to seal it very tightly i'm struggling there you go and then once it's sealed what are you going to do just tell them you know once it's sealed we're going to crush it that's the hammer and i'll go and i'll show you what it looks like when it's done okay so we crossed it with the hammer and why did we crush it we crush it so it's in smaller pieces and it melts quicker perfect and you don't have chunks in it right yeah which one you press we're actually gonna do layered ones with blue ones because we have extra of blues we're gonna start with just half of it so half of the amount that we have four inches four and a half because there's nine four jolly ranchers crushed up we didn't actually measure it it just looks about that thick and we are gone how we're gonna put these in the microwave and we're gonna put it in for 60 seconds at 80 percent and try to melt it so we can pour it into the molds and before we do that we're going to get some pam spray and spray it and wipe off any excess so that we can get them out of here after we're done that's funny they can't see what they're doing okay is that good no that's way too much oh yeah all right so that's a lot [Music] we're gonna kind of just wipe off any excess and we don't want it to be a ton but we do want to have that barrier so that it can pop out easily if it bubbles that means it's close to ready like that so we're just gonna be pouring it in yep so we don't want to burn ourselves yeah we are gonna pour it into the bottom quickly so it doesn't cool off and get hard again of a couple of the molds right sophia yeah okay will you keep pouring i'm gonna go or go get me a spatula so when you do this you're gonna want an adult with you but because it's gonna be really hot it's come on and if you mess up an accident um what should you do you should just like if it gets really hard you should put it back in the microwave because it can dry very easily okay can you get rid of those webs yep and pause it please yes okay here's number five it's gonna schedule a bit here's number six i wanna get some scissors and cut the webs that sounds so weird oh no that one's really full i don't think we are gonna add another color to that maybe that one will be all blue yeah okay let's see what this one is the final blue layer okay and you'll have all these super fine candy hairs everywhere that you can eat because they're delicious okay i'm gonna clean this up and start on the next color they're very interested in what's happening no no no no no no no no thank you not frank fun facts or dogs names are hank and june the black ones hank that one's june let's see your face [Music] okay no this is hank the black one thank you okay you get something yeah i wonder if this red and blue one is gonna be purple i guess we're gonna find out huh and just so you know if you don't want them to mix that awfully well don't um you would want them to cool first and then put the other color in candy wipes candy webs it's really hot okay pause it please okay so we have these yeah so we made about eight of them with about 12 jolly ranchers yes so we are gonna now put these in the fridge and let them harden and then we'll show you the final results and we're looking for about 15 minutes in the fridge so um we took them out of the fridge this is what they look like right now are they pop-outable yes they are yes they are yes they are you can pop them out and look they're little pixelated hearts i really like this craft um i was thinking about it for a while um i would recommend doing this because even the string things are delicious can i come in now yeah hello our grandmother our grandma left an hour ago or so but this is delicious i'm just going to steal some i'll see you next time and i hope you enjoyed this video please subscribe like and ring the bell notification button hopefully you like this video and i'll show you another video next time bye", "KEnZsZtKPK8": "[Music] hey everyone I'm showing you something today that I actually wasn't sure that would work out but it worked out perfectly so I thought it would be cool to use a OS capsules to move Jolly Rancher I don't know ring pops you can cover I don't know what you want to call them cos ring pops so I bought a bag of Jolly Ranchers I have four different color cos capsules here so I'm gonna try to make green I guess green apple right there I matched up with the three EOS it will be delicious then we're gonna have watermelon blue raspberry and grape dee-licious so before you do anything you want to make sure you have your capsule ready because once you heat up and I use the microwave your candies it hardens very quickly you want to make sure that you snap it back and then I'll keep in okay and I used five or six candies you can probably get away with five maybe before if that's all you have but for sure it's better to use a little bit more than a little bit less obviously and then I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time you could probably go over 20 the first time if you felt comfortable but just really really watch it because it does melt quite quickly actually maybe a total of 30 to 40 seconds so watch the ball might be hot here we have melted Jolly Rancher green apple flavor carefully carefully carefully pour it into your capsule and again it does hard it quite quickly the stuff in the bowl is already getting sticky it's hardening is you want to make sure you try to go as quick as possible if it does harden you can always microwave again and then put the remainder in your capsule so once you have that put it in the fridge or freezer and you should be good to go so when I went to go make the purple there was only three grapes my package which I tried to make work but it didn't so what I did is I melted the grapes so the three grapes that I had I poured it in and then you'll see that it actually melted two of the cherries because I had about 20 cherries that I wasn't using I guess Jolly Rancher things with everybody likes cherry I don't know so I put two extra cherries on top of the grape and then you'll see that I have to do that for the blue raspberry as well because they only gave me three blue ones so again I use some extra cherries and put them on top [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I am so happy with how this turned out it's still the perfect POS shape just like hope for [Music] the feature the extra little plastic that came off supposed to be but that's fine just pops right off put it back on the lid and breathe out back here awesome a Jolly Rancher gos repot can you see their face [Music] thanks for

it's definitely uh blowing my expectations away i would say that i'm pretty picky when it comes to like uh delta you know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i

legal amount of technically thc in it 0.3 um has delta a and flavored terpenes like i said the box is very nice you can scan here to see like all the [ __ ] that you need to know like i said i really love the packaging i love what they did here like i just think they did a really good job and it like i said it's lemon kush it definitely tastes like lemon man and with just a little bit of like kush terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor man um if this video you know let's try to get 40 likes man if this video gets 40 likes i'll that'll let me know that you guys still want to see more delta videos more delta reviews um yeah i'm already getting kind of high off this man it's not like obviously like a delta 900 it's not like super psychoactive uh but it is very calming and very relaxing and my body feels really like just chill my eyes feel really good it is an indica so i mean but let's go ahead and keep taking some hits man let's get [ __ ] high [ __ ] on this okay [Music] and let me know in the comments man um me and my

love i will see you guys in the next video all right peace you", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight

green apple infused candy so I chose Amsterdam apple liqueur then you'll need grain full color actually this is the gel type some people use a liquid depends on whatever works best for you okay then you'll need your apple flavor II this is by lorry and oils this kind is very strong so only a couple of drops you'll need then you have your candy thermometer it actually tells you on the side here

going to be trying some aiki eye candy my cousin um gave me these like asian candies you guys can see this there's a couple of different ones here but like yeah there's a couple of different flavors i think once pineapple i think one's melon we got a strawberry and looks like apple i think but uh yeah we're gonna try these let's see what they're like apparently like these are like little hard candies so right yeah interesting like false yeah see hmm that's pretty good i think that's apple very sweet but also has like a kind of an odd flavor to it interesting okay so that apple one not half bad had a little bit of a a weird like after flavor like it tasted a little off like a little weird i don't really know how to explain it i want to say chemically but maybe not i don't feel like that's correct it just tastes odd to me [Music] let's try the pineapple see if i can get it open there we go just a yellow ball i really taste like pineapple holy [ __ ] a little sour but like a lot of [ __ ] pineapple okay that's a lot of [ __ ] pineapple holy [ __ ] damn there's a lot of [ __ ] pineapple okay i'm used to like candies from other places usually having like subtle flavors not that i was like [ __ ] a face full of [ __ ] pineapple holy [ __ ] like i don't mind pineapple it's definitely not on my list of favorite flavors and i kind of tend to stray away from it a bit that was way too much for me to handle like that's too much pineapple for me to enjoy okay let's try melon i tend to like melon things so this one's a little different i think this is from a different company like the other three are all from um dake i think it's how it's pronounced see that but yeah this one i think is from a different company but this is supposed to be melon very melon flavor very button not sure if i like it not subtle very powerful i honestly might say that it might rival some american candies from like flavor like it's just [ __ ] packed full of flavor okay i'm gonna drop that chill wrapper there we go okay not really big on the melon it's not bad just a lot of melon like a face [ __ ] full of melon okay damn it's good just too much i think for me personally not bad though if you like melon or pineapple i would definitely suggest these like i don't mind melon but like it's a lot of melon flavor i do like though a lot a lot a lot is strawberry that's the last one that we have here so let's try strawberry this is a lot a lot of strawberry i'm gonna enjoy it i have a feeling that i really like it i do say one thing i like about these candies it's just a small thing but they're just like spheres of candy like it's not like like i don't know it's just like a small thing when it comes to like candy i don't know i just i like those shaped like almost like a perfect sphere i don't know it's it's kind of satisfying to me oddly enough the strawberry is really mellow it's not very powerful it's good it doesn't taste like like american strawberry candy it doesn't really taste like strawberries really which is really sweet it has like subtle notes of strawberry in there it tastes more like sugary sweet overall overall i'd give those candies probably like a like a seven out of ten they're not bad the pineapple and the melon are definitely extremely potent and powerful so much that it is not for me because it's just too much like they're just two flavors that like i'm not really super keen on and with them being as potent as they are it's just too much for me but if you guys like those flavors i would highly suggest this i didn't really like the apple at all like i said it kind of tasted funky and then on top of that the um the strawberry didn't really taste too much like strawberries at least the way that i imagine like strawberry candy in america so i guess that being like what i'm used to it doesn't taste like that so maybe it's just a difference of like cultural region or something i have no idea but either way like these were pretty decent candies overall and they all had like very potent flavors so honestly they're not bad candies so if you guys want to try them i'd definitely suggest hunting it down and nah daikey is about d-a-k-e-y-i you guys want to look it up should also be in the title of this description of the video so you guys want to look into it i suggested and uh thanks to my cousin for helping me out with these i appreciate it this was really cool i enjoyed trying these and uh i can see why she really likes these too like the the pineapple and the melon especially like those two had some like kicking flavors so i would definitely be recommending these to a couple of my friends who i know really enjoy like tropical flavors like that so anyway thank you guys for watching if you want to check out more videos like this check out my destitutorium playlist there's a bunch of food review stuff there if you guys want to check that out thank you for watching we'll see you at the journey's end tata you", "3OGqyjCwLv8": "hello everyone I am back sorry for the hair but today we are doing our second heart candy they are doing mighty candy it is white it is clear and you can totally see it so package up okay so far it kind of looks like a pill cloudy wanted that but you know it's candy so it's safe yes yes yes it smells extremely good it smells very great smells very flowery it smells like a peel of petunias but Nellie for serious I'm not like joking though it smells like wow okay so let's give this whitey candy ago and three two one I mean yes it tastes exactly like a lie to you like that is probably the only candy on the entire planet that has their resemblance to the natural fruit itself because everything else is pretty much artificial flavored but otherwise it's really good it's very sweet it's very tangy taste very sugary it's got a very fruity flavor though my initial thoughts on a 1 to 10 scale is probably about a 9 I don't know it's really good it's got a sour punch to it kind of though cuz a lot easier a little bit of a weird fruit cuz they're from China so you don't find that much in the US but alright I think it's a really great candy it comes in a bag and you can buy it online it comes in a pink bag that literally says lighty candy so you can find it anywhere on the Internet Amazon Google eBay you know places but no that's like she candy and I really do hope that you find it somewhere and that you buy it because it is absolutely amazing so also this is my favorite hard candy ever of all time on the planet just so you know but mighty candy there you have it okay that's the end of our hard candy series and have a fabulous day I", "luXEJcIAZpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and I'm here to celebrate our hundredth video with a tour of the shop and some special hundred emoji candy so I've already added the flavour to the pot as I pour it and what's the flavor you ask while I'm doing two different flavors with two different candies for this assortment there'll be a brown wrapped candy which will be coffee flavored but it won't be a standard coffee it'll be a Kona coffee a Hawaiian coffee that Kahlua is based off it's delicious and the second one is gonna be amaretto because I like amaretto on my coffee and we're gonna do this with a hundred emoji logo and until I made this video I didn't know there were two versions of this emoji one is used by Apple and one is used by Android of course and the best part about this we're gonna give the candy away free with an order and we'll give more information about that later in the video these videos were actually created for two reasons I guess three the first one was to preserve some history in a public forum another one was to get people off the interstate were right next to i-10 and Tallahassee Florida and ten thousand cars a day drive by and I was a little offended none of them were coming into my shop so I thought I would tell people I was here I figured they'd want to come if they knew about me so I ended up putting up these videos and inviting people in and you know what you guys have come and I want to thank you so much mention in the comments if you've come by the shop in person I'm always interested in how many of these people who visit still watch my videos and number three of course was I wanted more people to experience the candy that I make I'm very proud of it you know so for the last 99 videos I made videos about history about candy making and I made sure that candy was the star not me this video is gonna be a little different because I realized a lot of you don't know the history of lofty pursuits this seemed to be the time to share it lofty pursuit started as a outgrowth of another business I had originally called gravity specific I started it with Jonathan Lyons that later became a firm called infinite illusions and we manufactured juggling equipment and shipped it worldwide I branched into yo-yos and eventually we need storefront and the storefront opened in 1993 on September 17th Here I am juggling in front of that storefront and we sold stunt kites and things like that we moved five times in the history of the business picking up something every time we expanded into toys with one move and board games with another and we eventually expanded into a scream and we expanded into candy making and lastly two and a half years ago we expanded into serving brunch seven days a week over the last 33 years one thing has become clear nothing stays the same your customers change every four or five years and I'm convinced if you don't change with them you get left behind so I keep on changing and I keep on figuring out new creative ways to do things and that's what lofty pursuits is about a reporter once called lofty pursuits a performance art project that happens to turn a profit that reporter might even be right I mean I don't have employee the month photos I paint portraits of my employees instead and the things that decorate the shop aren't like a Cracker Barrel where I'm always afraid of going into one and finding a photo of my grandparents on the wall everything is something special something that interacted with me or the store of the business from paintings I did four of the Creature from the Black Lagoon because it was filmed 20 minutes from here and I at one point ran the soda fountain out overlooking the springs where it was filled to things like the musical instruments which I painted that our marching band uses to circus memorabilia gifts I've been given things that I just find interesting and things that make me laugh and all of this with the candy and everything else on a background of a soda fountain where we use glass serving dishes and we have a menu with 52 sundaes because there are 52 Sundays in the year how many Sundays do you want me to have and the food that you may know from the videos is wrapped by our toy store the toy store we started with back in 1993 it's still here and it's bigger than it ever was we're known for a board game collection on our general toys that I try to pick out to make people smile once again and find things they can't find elsewhere people ask me what we sell here at lofty pursuits and I try to sell happiness that's my answer if I can put a smile on somebody's face it makes me happy and it makes what I do worthwhile and that brings me back to the YouTube channel and the YouTube channel now allows me to make people happy it seems around the world I can't tell you how much joy that brings and that's why I made a hundred videos and you guys keep getting the candy that I can ship because I haven't figured out how to easily ship ice cream I seem to be making you happy and it makes me happy and you know too many people don't worry about enough happiness in their life and I have a lot and you know that's good well back to the candy and the candy you can probably tell because I used yellow when I stirred in the food coloring is not going to be the coffee this is gonna be the amaretto and we're going to pull this on the hook for a couple of minutes and I'm pulling it here because I left the candy unfortunately cool on LY evenly and I need to fix my problem I'm gonna put it on my candy pulling machine and if there are hot spots when the Machine goes it'll tear where this candy is hotter than others bits and of course what I'm doing here is I'm folding in air bubbles and each of those air bubbles make the candy reflect light and that makes this candy white this is gonna be the white part of the candy now for certain candies it's either too hot or too heavy for me to pull unlock and I use this machine to help me but those few poles on the hook really made a difference to make this machine happy with the candy staying on it if you've seen a bunch of our videos this music is probably familiar to you this band is called bounce house and it used to be the house band of lofty pursuits years ago they split up and went their separate ways but we still love their music and I thought I'd bring it back for this video being that it's the hundredth video at all to make the hundred design we're gonna start by making one of the zeros and we're gonna do that by wrapping some white candy that we've cooled a little bit more than the rest with some red candy if you'd like to try some of our candy for yourself go to www.hawaii.edu and you place an order worth ten dollars or more we'll toss in a free sample bag of this candy which is of course a blend of the sama red oh you're seeing us mix and the coffee flavor I told you about and keep in mind we're only going to have this candy for a week or two but this video will be up four years so before you try the coupon code look at the date we posted this video and see if you think it's up and working now that we've built the two zeros it's time to build the one the one was tricky because I'm trying to hold a sharp corner and I don't want it to round out and I want the flat side to be round I accomplished this doing a lot of temperature control of course for colder candy stays straighter but if I don't do it right it won't pull evenly in the next step now we end up putting a spacer on the one and all that's left are the stripes that go under the one [Music] and now that the design is done it's time to wrap it in the white-hot sugar [Music] and lastly the outer wrap of yellow I [Music] placed the hot sugar on our batch roller this cool little machine from about 1910 and it keeps the candy spinning to keep the design from distorting and I'm gonna size it down from about a 7 inch diameter log of candy down to about a half inch rod of candy at this point the way the candy behaves is really cool it's a non-newtonian fluid you may have heard of it like it behaves like a thick version of that I can pull it out slowly and if the Hays almost like a liquid but if I hit it hard with the back of the scissors it shatters at a clean wide [Music] [Music] all that's left for me to do is to cut it into individual pieces on our little candy anvil and we have thousands of pieces of candy to send to you we're gonna blend this with the coffee flavor make an assortment make little bags and we'll include if you use our coupon code 100 just the numbers thank you for watching this video and

all but I will make an exception for the Walking Dead and Breaking Bad which is premiering this Sunday and I wanted to have something fun to accompany me instead of Junior Mints or the conventional popcorn I'm going to tap these in my purse and snap on them throughout the night watching this premiere it's going to be shattered blue hard candies so hang out with me and I'll show you exactly how to whip this up these are the only ingredients that you'll need so it's super simple very easy and quick so you'll need some sugar I have some regular granulated sugar and then drip in some corn syrup and if you first spray it with a little bit of cooking spray it'll slip right out just like this and then third and clean after everything is cooked together and bubbly you want to add in a little bit of color and it's not important like with buttercream to use gel because it won't really affect the consistency so you can use your inexpensive blue water color in this instance then you just want to go in there and give it a nice whisk and you're going to add in that blue color in that tin after it's bubbly so just mix it's going to be clumpy it's totally fine and then when it's all mixed together you can add in some chili powder I'm just kidding but you can add in a little bit of salt to kind of balance out the sweetness from the corn syrup and from the sugar so I'm going to pop this in the microwave covered with plastic for about three minutes and different microwave temperatures will vary depending on how strong it is but you can also do this over the stovetop if you like but how easy-peasy is the microwave you just pop it in there so I didn't forget it just taking out my cup at the three minute mark and it'll be a light amber color and you want to be careful and slowly take off the plastic because you're going to discard this one and put a new one on top because you don't want that condensation to kind of beep in there so take that off you don't want to stir and you want to cover it with the new plastic and pop it in there for an extra three minutes and just keep your eye on it because you don't want it to be an overflowing sticky mess so just be near and make sure the vessel that you filled your candy in is large enough to kind of hold it all together this is the part you want to work really fast you want to uncover the plastic and then drip in little drops of your blue color and now you can start be very quick about it this is all and if you want to you can put some flavorings in here at this moment as well and I have some parchment or some soap at standing by because I want to pour it on there and let it harden so be careful because it is hot sugar and just pour it onto your prepared surface look at that how cool looking is that this would be really cool to do with your kids as long as you're watching them after about 15 minutes time cooling in the refrigerator it is now ready to smash into a million shimmering pieces so to get those little pieces you want to shatter them with I'm using a mortar pestle just that part of it or you can use the bottom of a dull knife or really anything you can use a rolling pin and just kind of crack over it but now comes the fun part you can just go in there and smash what you end up with are these blue sparkling sapphire pieces like this and you can put them in little glass pane or little candy bags or whatever you want to serve them in and they're really fun and perfect for breaking bad [Music]", "8WqqJGXaxu8": "hello I'm Shaun editor at screwy monkey calm and today we're looking at ten more bizarre candies from around the world if you checked out our last video I had sent Mario out on a little shopping excursion to find some stuff for us to have fun with during our videos and he brought back some incredibly bizarre candies from all over the world we actually did ten already in the previous video and I thought there were only ten and I was really relieved that I made it through actually eating ten of these interesting things and then I found out they were actually ten more so we're going to do ten more bizarre candies from around the world Mario tell me this is a joke tell me that really are not ten more no we got ten one all right number one this is like a dry ice cream cone giant coupley cozy obviously also from Japan I'm guessing all right this is like bizarre actually it looks like one of those like drumsticks you know like you get from like 7-eleven and the case thing by like see it's like one of those things but if you look really really really close you can actually see it's like it's like freeze-dried let's check it out oh it smells really good though I'm not gonna lie it smells like a brownie like seriously it's mostly I'm just gonna smell it for a while dude that does not look like that that that that picture does not equate to that I don't know what that is Wow yeah so that's what you get when you cut it open let's check that out it tastes like those little little wafer cookies oh yeah it does yeah except in are like a really giant very big scale these are really good actually yeah oh wow I might cut about loss for words I have so much better than I expected it to be I really recommend if you can get your hands on one of these you totally get your hands on one of these this one's the chocolate one and this is this is really amazing you can't stop I forgot to mention in the beginning of this video just like our last video each of the products that we rate just in case you didn't see the last one we are going to rate it either a Sukkot which means put it in your mouth because it's good or we're going to rate it a chuckit which means just get rid of it throughout in the trash wherever because it doesn't belong anywhere near your body and this one is definitely a Sukkot I'm gonna polish the Restless thing off there's there's no way I'm gonna stop eating this like so I finally finished eating that one which means it is time for number two you Turkish Delight is from Turkey all right this is really heavy actually and kind of looks expensive do I have any money left that for this Mario it was decent price okay it looks a little bit like when you coat pieces of cut up chicken in flour so that frightens with me a lot actually but they are vegan so I know there's no chicken in them so that's good I think that the light part of these is that you're delighted if you can actually get them open and get into them these look really incredibly scary is that that's like coated and what I'm guessing is sugar and it is like sealed and they look messy and they're already getting all over my hands so I just like shake that off you definitely don't want to like eat these and then like go get stopped by the cops though because they're gonna ask you where all the white powder all over your fingers and noses may have some explaining to do well here we go I really didn't expect to like these I'm going to be really honest I really thought I would not like these because I really thought they would be kind of gross with the Rose flavor but these are actually really quite good I would definitely eat these again back down and again yeah these are really awesome I think this do be really good actually to give to your significant other I'm like Valentine's Day I'm gonna be really cool candy to give them messy though I'm getting white stuff all over the place but these are really incredibly good and these are definitely a Succot and worth whatever you paid for them but yeah those are really good I still have white powder all over me Wow it's like a it's like a party from the seventies Mario number three Chu it's it's a product that the UK saw back yeah well is it the UK or is it sabaki oh I am going to guess that they're from the UK because there's a website on the side that says dot uk' they're made in Slovakia okay so chew it I've actually heard of these before though Mario because there is like a lot of social media buzz or there was a couple years ago about these so I've actually heard about these before but these are really incredibly cool never had one though so that's actually really pretty awesome I'm gonna guess they're like starburst or something this one is fruit salad flavor which kind of scares me by the way because I'm not quite sure what that means it's like fruit salad flavors like what all fruits it's kind of a multi fruit from the last video it's kind of like um like all flavors I gotta sleep talked with this in my mouth sooo much should be sticking to every bit of my teeth actually they're very chewy that's definitely that's definitely they're named appropriately they definitely got to chew it the fruit salad flavor is pretty good what I'm actually getting though is just the overwhelming taste of pineapple so have you ever had like a pineapple Laffy Taffy it's kind of what they taste like they dragon on the package is incredibly incredibly adorable so I'm gonna give it I'm going to say it's a Sukkot just for the cuteness of the dragon on the package and just because it does a really great pine apple flavor Mario number four click through mochi okay I've had mochi before but not like a candy like a fruit mochi like Kent not like a candy mochi is from Japan right in Taiwan but I'm pretty sure mochi is Japanese it originated from Japan oh but it's made in Taiwan so it says it's orange strawberry and hami melon yeah my melon a my melon I've got no idea what that is by the way my pronunciation and always I'm sure is completely wrong so if you're running across this video and how to pronounce any of these I guarantee you I'm messing everything in one of these up cuz I've never seen them before I got no idea how to pronounce them and I'm generally pretty bad about that anyway but let's take a let's take a look at these Oh check that out they're like filled with air and they're SuperDuper soft in there oh that is awesome I don't know if I can tell what flavors what though it looks like the differentiation like the actual name of the what it is is in Japanese I think so I can't really read so I'm just gonna pick one at random and hope it's melon I can't get over how SuperDuper soft these are Wow it's like I just want to like play with it I just want to like touch it and feel it and play with it oh it actually pulls like something else but I'm not I'm not gonna go there let see what they alright it's got a whiff of the smell oh this one's definitely strawberry oh that's intense wow wow wow oh I don't want to bite it it's so soft here we go oh oh wow yeah so I'm gonna see that pardon my bite mark but it's like fruit filled on the inside and then it's got like a little layer of like cream and then that really really really cool sort of like jelly outside that is really good Wow you know so far I've liked everything in this video which I guess is not necessarily a bad thing but wow these are really good like fruit and milky that's a Sukkot Mario number five it's got a nipple BB pullets again I don't know how to pronounce this BB pulla it's candy from Mexico Mario it's gonna be spicy again definitely sealed how do they see our children to get into these things I mean I don't have any children go around wielding knives but it seems the only way to get into most of these alright so so it's got like a hard candy hard candy nipple I mean that's a only way to really describe this I mean it's tell me that's not a nipple seriously tell me that is not a nipple and then you I don't know how you get it to a hit okay okay we're in I'm sweating Wow okay oh it's got a lock handle okay oh wait did I actually like suck it again yeah what's with all that Mexican candies it's like they're spicy and you gotta suck on them and it's like it's all kind of like naughty tisk I'm nipa l-- I don't like nothing so really it seems like this is just a vehicle to get that out of there like I I don't really think that has much flavor really it's it's a slight again if you remember the last video we had the hands the little sucker a lollipop hand things and they tasted red like you can't really describe the flavor they just tasted like you would imagine bread taste and that's kind of how this tastes like but much more subtle like it doesn't actually taste like much except bread sweet and now it's all it's all coated with whatever that is on the inside and that really just hits like sugar and like a tiny that is even with that spicy I mean like that's kind of well you said was my from it was like Mexican candy is that it was like maybe spicy for the most part this just tastes like sugar I mean it's kind of gross actually kind of just sugar and more sugar and sugar no I'm gonna set it to chuck it it's kind of bad yeah got over that one give me something good Mario number six for future reference black and candy should not really go together okay thanks bonbon noir so the black bonbons obviously Noir is blacks Macedonia seriously next I'm we do one of these please bring a map because I need to look over these places are Macedonia so it says hard filled candies I'm guessing they're licorice cuz they're black this thing dude what is this what's up with that it's like that has got to be the scariest thing I've ever seen on a candy package in my entire life I mean seriously that gave me nightmares I'm gonna go to bed tonight and I'm going to have nightmares that this freakish little smiling kid with the rope on the front it looks kind of like a serial killer in training is going to strangle me and kill me that is not okay I mean check that out that is just that is just freaky I mean that just that's not okay not all right whatsoever let's check these out shame so these are like more like licorice and since I click pushy and hard these are actually really good like I actually really like these a lot yeah there have one whoops here have another that way so these are actually really good I really really like these they're super sweet and super licorice II but they're not like as everyone knew from like the last time like the last licorice candy that we did in the previous video don't stop sorry so as everyone knows from the last licorice candy in the previous video we did they I didn't I'm not a big fan of licorice like I'm really not like I really do not like licorice very much and but these are actually really good like they're very mild licorice flavor um I can actually see myself eating these so suck it it's a Sukkot I never thought I would say that for licorice but this is licorice you should definitely suck Oh Mario I'm ready for my next sweet treat so Driss sorry SIA the dryn SIA said Rin see I said Jorun SIA in 1910 and if I'm butchering that let me know ran mix so these it's as grand mix without colorings so they're not artificially colored that's cool there's a product product at Italy so they're from Italy they're Italian candies how cool looks like they got a lot of fruit flavors on the inside and also a cup of coffee on the package which I really hope there's a copy of flavored one and if not that's cool because I also like fruit - this is really cool there is a lot of variety here there's tons and tons of different things in here I would love to actually taste each and every one of these on camera but alas that's not gonna happen I'm hoping frizzy means it's like fizzy it's like the same thing [Music] that's weird I wish you could feel this like I was a really bizarre texture to it actually it's like really rough oh I don't have a little bit of a it's frizzy okay it is fitting in my mouth well it's like a party going on in there we were going to a party in my mouth it's literally vising in my mouth oh wow that is an awesome sensation this is this is this you know what SCID Rin SIA or have you pronounce your brand name your grand mix simply for the fact that is a party in my mouth and that is an incredibly cool feeling you get a suck it Wow even though I'm no longer at the candy my mouth I can still feel the fizzy going on in that one that's odd anyways I believe it's number eight number eight Mario dude you didn't is it like my birthday or something I mean seriously is it you bought me you got me coffee candy you know I love coffee candy it is like one of my favorite things ever it's tuyas so is it Turkish again Wow we definitely have a lot of Turkish products those look really incredibly good though do anything so I grew up eating coffee candy probably more than I should have as a kid I'm sure it was highly inappropriate and with all the caffeine in the candy and also drinking coffee but it's a whole different story Oh check that out oh just the bag just the bag smells good coffee intense let's see if these are intense I was like the packaging is pretty intense I can't get it open so candy makers from like around the world let's put this shape what what is with this shape is really you can do better there's gotta be a different shape oh really like that is that oh wow that I mean I keep saying well I notice a lot a lot but like wow these are amazing alts like this amazing like just insane these are good that are really really really good I mean very appropriately named too by the way coffee intense because it's that is a very intense coffee flavor Wow I if I could marry a candy it would probably be these cool these are these are definitely a Sukkot definitely a Sukkot and these are also coming home with me these these are these are good these are really good well I feel completely wired now number nine we couldn't afford a whole package of candy pika Gomes peak ergo was more Mexican candy yeah let me guess oh look tamarind my favorite spicy tamarind my favorite like in Mexico is it like Willy Wonka and his tamarind vectoring that's good it seems like I'm just gonna dig in for these because I really seriously doubt I'm gonna like these honestly they're brown little balls like cute it's cute I lost my ball it's actually kind of cute though I mean like this is like little face that's on these I know if you can see a little face it's really kind of adorable but other than that there's not really much to say about these except for a little balls of tamarind with some spice in them I'm sure let's check them out they're sticky these are salty and sweet kind of spicy they get really soft really fast what does that consist mmm oh wow okay so so check out these were originally my first one in my mouth totally totally going to be a chuck it cuz I was not gonna stand for that little flavor in the beginning it's just like spicy and like salt and I don't know what when I get soft you sure like chew it a little bit there you go like that really sweet tamarind like I burst into your mouth well they become really really really good so I'm gonna give this a suck it by surprise it was definitely a Succot number ten number ten which is actually number 20 I'm gonna guess these are not from Mexico Slovenia derp Slovenia also make the UK candy things okay love being less Nick carmly-- why not that sounds right sure it's not but how else would you pronounce that come on incidentally there is the cutest little beaver on the front it's a little beaver oh so so cute and these are hazelnuts so you know they're gonna be really good they're so cute like seriously the little beaver I like I want a poster of like this little beaver like on my wall well it's a squirrel okay next up monkey squirrels or the cutest thing as this court hood is a squirrel a squirrel once I'm hoping this is better than that was seriously tell me that isn't some only play-doh yeah it's also play-doh oh my god this one's a play-doh please don't taste like play-doh please don't play taste a play-doh wall oh god okay oh how disappointing so play-doh tastes better than these do the flavor that is there is kind of kind of gross and just not very good a lot like they smelled like they smell like Plato like they kind of do taste like play-doh and by the way the consistency it's kind of grainy like it's just yeah no sorry squirrel beaver squirrel whatever it sucks too because I was really willing to tell people I finally put a beaver in my mouth I find it's a squirrel these are a chuck it check it check them check them all check it so I hope you've

all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this

overlay my favorite it was really really really chewy like it was a hard candy than a soft candy which I mentioned before is not my favorite which if you're into her candy she might be your thing but as some of us mentioned it even look kind of awkward when I was eating it like it was definitely a little big for my liking overall the medicated aspect of it I mean I didn't really get a lot out of it I don't know maybe if her candies are not my way to get medicated it seems that the brownie has been the only thing that's giving me a really good kick yeah I also have a really high tolerance I've noticed so that could be the other reason why but if you ever lower lower tolerance maybe these could be something that you could try and let me know if they work for you because they definitely didn't really work for me whatever reason but I'd love to hear your feedback on it and if someone else had a different experience maybe let me know I don't know very odd it's not even like I was eating a whole bunch before that they would maybe get absorbed I did also mention that I am on my period so that has been known to have a little bit of an effect with females well a lot of effect apparently because apparently we need to smoke a lot more and consume a lot more when it is her time of the month for whatever reason thank you mother nature but yeah overall they were bad I went about get them again no probably not um as I said I'm just all about the soft I just keep saying brownie I really wanted to be a brownie apparently it's the fudge I really really like the fudge so far that has been my favorite but yeah I have a few more things to try so stay tuned and hopefully I'll be able to get some more stuff and keep reviewing I also do have another exciting interview coming up possibly later on early next week I'm in the process of kind of putting together that review because it's a little bit longer and I'm kind of getting that one together but I'm first gonna do an

everybody it's Brad with big family homestead and in this video we are making candy sweet awesome simple easy candy so let's get to it that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "dmFGGXRKRac": "[Music] and delight edibles thank you for joining me my name is Liz and today we are gonna be making chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "EyHWy26P6_s": "I'm back again wheeling when I'm a here in a

easier Oh ha good morning good morning our scripture lesson is from Matthew 23 12 7 and 25 to 28 then jesus said to the crowd and to the disciples the teachers of the law and the Pharisees Simeon Moses's see so you must obey them do everything they tell you but do not do what they do and they not practice what they preach they tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift finger to believe them everything they do is done for men to see they make their phylacteries why and the tassels undergarments walls they love the place of water and banquets and those deportes seats in the synagogues they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and how men call the rabbi well she teachers of law and Pharisees you hypocrites you clean the outside puppet dish but inside their own grief and self-indulgence blind Pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and dish and then outside also will weekly woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside but everything done played in the same way on the outside you appear to be to us righteous but on the inside uniform for poverty and wickedness bangalore dad is blessing to comedian here I'm small Department we're going to start off towards various ones privately then Brad we ask that you would be here right now God keeps us awake keepers of tempo truly open our ears to what you desire to teach us at an individual accomplice be smart enough to apply of pray this in Jesus name Amen unless you've been living under a rock somewhere you have heard something about the arrest on charges being made against a buffet see assuming that everybody hears heard something about that I'm David patient was youth pastor over east brady baptist church he was like oh that position or results in that position back this past July but this past Tuesday he was arrested on having charges of inappropriate relationship with a girl in his youth group and I think it's important you may be clear precisely what those charges are because it's just all kinds of rumors that are floating around to be calm that he's being accused according the affidavit of kissing her when she was 15 and when she was 16 touching her really loved her clothes this past August and it's a scandal that has rocked the Baptist Church we've been praying for the Baptist Church for a while over the situation details have just fun to come out about it though and it's a scandal that has brought this community in general not even thus the church and that's what David did but support for me to tell you who David is to me so that you can understand where this sermon is coming from I've known David and his family for 21 years now and have been friends with the entire family for that time I'm entered him as a youth I was his youth pastor growing up and as he grew older he became one of my closest friends and he's been an older brother to my children and he's been a younger brother to me he's gone on vacation with my family he's lived with us for several months before he got married not only that he was the youth pastor at my brother-in-law's church so to me this situation is about as close as they come and to say that my family has been affected by this would be hitting the under state for the world my family's been devastated by this and my brother off he's been on that borderline nervous breakdown for the past couple of months and one of the things that really makes this situation so painful is that as you grow close to somebody anybody but especially those people that you spent a lot of time you you get an image in your mind of who they really are you just feel like you know deep down you know them you know who they are and then when things like this happen it just shatters that image it just breaks it into a thousand pieces and leaves you picking them up wondering if anything anything at all that you're new real the scripture that I chose this morning to talk about deals with with this it deals with the thought of what is truly inside of a person and when we take a look at Matthew chapter 23 we find that much of this chapter is spending Jesus just tear the Pharisees on one side and write down the other and this section is actually known as the seven was it section because seven times in a section of scripture jesus starts by saying woe to you teachers of the law Pharisees you hypocrites and when you read through this section you can see Jesus's he's really letting them have it you almost kind of feel bad for the Pharisees that were standing there listening to this and if you look at the sec's description most of this section revolves around complaints about the fact that they care more about what the outside of the person looks like what they look like on the outside the people around them then was actually going on on the ends and Susan read first two of those woes this morning here's verse 25 one created for you again what are you teaches a belong Pharisees you hypocrites you clean the outside of the cup of this for the insider full of greed and self-indulgence client Pharisees first going the inside of the competition the outside will also be clean and then the second one woe to you teachers along Pharisees you hypocrites you're like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but it's we're full of dead men's bones and everything unclean in the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness so if Jesus in their section is giving us two visuals of how it doesn't matter how pretty you make something look on the outside if the inside is still rot you know you know what kind of reminds me I think I've mentioned this before but it reminds me of a box of mystery chocolates you ever get a box of mystery chocolates you know maybe it's Valentine's Day or Christmas and you just get a box of chocolates from somebody with their mystery chocolates because they didn't come with one of those handy dandy little guides inside that tells you what chocolate is where so you know whether these chocolates and they all look the same I mean they do look pretty good cuz they're all chocolate on the outside but what you're not happy because you don't have the guy is you have to play the Russian Roulette chocolate game that's what you have to play you play this game before haven't you and you're fine you're still praying the mystery chocolate prayer don't you because you take it out and look at it you can't tell much I you say oh lord please don't let this be disgusting please don't let it be discussed you can't not eat it you have to eat it but you're really afraid and terrified what might be on the inside and you take it it looks okay you take that first bite and maybe you lucked out you didn't get the bullet you said oh thank you Jesus is coconut it's comforting at home oh that's great that's great so you're confidently go back into the second one and that was your mistake right there you should pull the second one out you take a bite into it it's toothpaste why don't you taste inside Charlotte who put their evil panda but that if you play you play the Russian Roulette chocolate me because every single chocolate it looks good on the outside but what really matters is what they have chosen to fill it with on the inside because it might be something very good or it might be something very very fast and this is what the Pharisees were doing the chocolates i was going to jonathan's this is what the pharisees were doing they were so concerned with looking good on the outside for everybody else to see that they were trying really hard to look good but they really weren't putting any time and effort and then actually being good and actually being the person on the inside that they wanted everybody else on the outside to to see them and think of them as I think in some sense I think we're all mismatched like that I really do because we are so driven by what people think about us we are so motivated to look good when other people see us that we allow that desire to take precedence over actually being a good that's what we do if you understand that it's less about what's actually going on inside here anymore about but everybody else sees on the outside because they've kind of see what's good they've kind of see so we are constantly thinking about how people see us and then we are adjusting our behaviors based upon their perception obvious one was really going on in here just based upon how it appears on the outside and we want to doing or not doing certain things simply based upon what other people around us would think they've all been there having to maybe I don't curse in public because people hear me but Mike swear like a sailor have my own house right maybe if someone else is in a room I won't turn on a particular show but when they're not home anything goes maybe I won't tell the racist joke at church but went on a work how do I one just to get a laugh they've gotta love someone to their face and then talk them on one side down the other one and not listen maybe if a fellow Krishna is in the car I Drive it very tightly and peacefully but if they aren't that I'm much more likely to wait by with one thing some of you I know I know he didn't recognize me in my car I reckon that robot keep up appearances we are about keeping up appearances my dad went to a seminary when he was younger that told him they were list rules it he was a follow one of these rules was that he was not allowed to go see in the movie theater an r-rated movie he could not go to the theater and watch an r-rated movie but he couldn't rent it and bring it home and watch it in his house because they don't want people to see that it wasn't about whether or not it was right around was about what other people saw we are constantly living our lives trying to give off the appearance that we are good people that we are living a good life that life is good that everything is good that we are the model of perfection but inside it's just our almost a way that they appear big everybody gave it to start off this morning I apologize because it is a very emotional subject for me right now but I need to share a little bit more to you so that you can understand what I'm coming from David actually preach in this church not just passed a patient whether the vacation before that on when I went away and he did a good job I mean people really wanted him to come back just because he was a good speaker when he spoke he was great he just spoke at the convocation he aimed the convocation at graduation and when they were done in here just the robbers in a kind who was that again he's really good he sounds like a really good guy and he had an active and growing youth ministry he did it was it was the best in the area and kids youth really came to a saving relationship with Jesus they profess Jesus and were baptized in the Baptist Church new cosmic and on the outside david looked like a model youth pastor but on the inside there was so much tunnel there was just on one and david was suffering and he is suffering from a major mental disorder that costs an extreme pain every single day of his life and his smile and his lap on the outsider it was just an act to cover up what was really going on on the inside I'm not trying to do this to excuse what's happened but I just want you to understand that because of this pain he made several stupid and ungodly decisions which is obviously now suffering consequences of only outside he look good on the inside he was dying and that's one of the many dangers inherent in making yourself look better on the outside that you actually are on the inside because if people could see what you were going through then love you they could support you they could help you they could lift you up but instead of allowing them to see the reality of the situation we put on this chocolate coated exterior and just let everybody believed that everything is okay I'm good we're good we're all doing good and thing is that it's exhausting to try to keep up appearances it is tired to pretend like every single day everything is okay when it's not in every moment when we put on that hard exterior is spent praying and hoping that somebody doesn't see through it that they can't get past and see through it see that exterior that we've created that shows us as this beautiful strong perfect person because then you'll actually see what's going on in the inside god forbid that folks you don't have to lie it's okay to not be okay and I know why we do this I know why we do this it's because we are so quick to point out each other's flaws it's because we are so fast dl crucifying it with the rest of the crowd that we make each other so terrified of messing up so afraid of letting just that crap split open so that they can see who we truly are and when we do that we put so much effort into keeping the outside looking perfect while the inside is just a mess and we become like the Pharisees we spent the whole day cleaning the outside of the bowl a bowl that we ever took time to watch the inside of folks there are two things I want you to learn from this treasure and I want you to learn from David's life for them there are two things that we can do to put an end to this need to put on that perfect shelter covers up or flaws first thing that we can do is to stop judging each other so harshly when brother or sister steps outside of God's desires let us stop yelling hate-filled and self-righteous holier-than-thou speech because we're condemning someone and because their shell broke but God forbid apart as it ever does happen as we're all super hushed just hope we met nobody sees on flawless I'm asking let's find a brother or sister who is hurting and then gently bring them back into the fold with love not punish them we hate as we as Christians tend to do and say I'm asking list let us take down these hard exteriors that we weren't so hard to polish and it may look perfect let us stop lying to each other about who we really are instead let us give each other the opportunity to love to except to embrace who we really are flaws all and by doing this less inspiring each other not to simply make ourselves look good on the outside but to bring these balls down so that we can lovingly help each other truly be the person and we desire everyone to see so I just ask you to take no more eight no more lies I'm telling me you're all worth love fall as a mom let's pray you've got so many times we find ourselves relating to the Pharisees godness so just one more of those moments god I just ask that you help us help us through your scripture and through life lessons to be strong enough to take down an art exterior to open ourselves up to those around us to be willing to look at the inside instead of just the outside so that through your love and a lot of the love of others we might be able to change who we really are not just change we appear to be we pray this in Jesus name", "njfnqSonUw8": "hi welcome to much makes it today I'll be showing you how I made Jolly Rancher James these are the supplies you're going to need a little goes

mindful of the tray it is going to be [Music] when it's cooled they should release really easily from the trade because of degrees and then you're all set and a great selection of multicolor Charlie Brown wipe away any excess grease that's on the gems and they all ready to use everybody hope you enjoyed this video", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please check out the herbal infuser calm if you want to buy

Jolly Ranchers those issues related to how they interact with your braces and why we recommend not having them has to do with the crunch factor so the lollipop you can have one of course you take care of all the issues that go along with sugar and cavities but as you lick the lollipop and you get closer to the end you have that piece that you're tempted to crunch with your teeth and if you crunch that on the side that sign of that candy will hit the braces and almost guarantee is almost guaranteed to pop something off namely the brace off the surface of the tooth because the way the brace comes off is it flexes off or bends off the surface of the tooth and the candy when it hits it on a crunch does not Bend and the braces will Bend before the candy does so depending on how careful you are how thin that last piece candy crunch is you could get away with it but that one is probably not one worth the risk there a lot of different options so I hope that makes sense to you have a wonderful day you guys thanks", "vytVK7ynIPs": "we're doing the professional try sub it's like an actual draw John mattress but like its shape does something else it's really good those two flavors go

it's not bad again artificial to me i'm gonna give it a seven yeah seven it's a bit sour five and again it's a bit sour wait did i just say that twice it's a bit sour and it's a bit artificial is what

artificial peach flavor which is fine i mean it does taste like peach yeah it does but it's more like the art you can tell there's an extent where you can tell it's not peach and that's where the artificial light comes in so it's not bad um this is my favorite jaw ranch i've ever had probably not but he's making it rain and jolly ranchers i guess [Music] anyways um go dodgers um i hope you

"a9yzAaEc0HU": "sour sweet watermelon that's right everyone welcome back to walk in the candy aisle my name is Jeff and today we have a another continuation of our sour patch kids reviews we've been doing a few of those lately we are looking at sour patch kids watermelon that is right the first of the sour patch kids brands skew um that you know uh are not kids they're watermelons you know I was telling you last week I did a review of the sour patch kids tropical I was noting that it was interesting that at least here in Canada where we have a sour patch kids the may the Maynard's brand has been I sorry not the mainers brand but Maynard's is on it all too but the sour patch kids branding has been put on a bunch of different products including the sour cherry blasters the fuzzy peaches but I believe that watermelon I don't think that Mainers launched watermelons anything other than under Sour Patch Kids I think Maynard's I think the watermelons have always been Sour Patch Kids you guys feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in the comments below I I have never had this before and this product has been around for quite a while I I think it's God who have been at least for years maybe five years I it's been around for a while um yeah but but I've never had it um I don't usually seek out water moon stuff it's not that I always hate it I don't and I do like real watermelon but these are sour gummy watermelons just you know under the sour patch kids branding but like I said they're not kid shaped most of the other ones all the other ones I've reviewed here on this channel have been kid shaped I don't think it says anything of interest really here let's just break into them we don't need to you know draw it out too long here let's just have a look at these port also this packaging I not this packaging this bag in particular I'm not gonna ding it for that there wasn't a ton on the shelf when I got these and like the whole bottom of this bag this is like a big clump here they're all seem to be like fuse together I you know that that hat would could happen to anyone we're not gonna ding it on that you know a few of these are sort of intact to the way that I believe they are supposed to look Oh little green a little pink that's wait wait something's wrong that's not how a watermelon looks supposed to be green all around the outside wait a second wincing so it looks like there's a little green in pink on all of these but not very consistent in its patterning and design okay well forget that one those are really stuck there that looks kind of like green on the outside that's just like a dot of green mostly pink I know I mean I guess okay hold on what I'm trying to see is is the green in the same place like that green at least if the green was like on the outside of the circle I guess that's kind of on the outside of the circle then you can be like well it's the rind of the watermelon right there's no green on this one at all do the green does the green have a different flavor it shouldn't no it all should just taste like watermelon it's is this semantics or am I am I making way too much out of nothing guys what do you think cuz I am uncertain how far I should take this you know does it look like the product it's supposed to look like I'll tell you this that does not look like that really I mean it's close but it's not there's not a single one here that actually looks like a circle of green around a half circle of pink unfortunate let's get over it III wish they all had some green on them at least that would have been something let's get over and just give them a try though I'm expecting the leap totally fine it's our water Mon is this a flavor that you want to have that should exist not done a ton elsewhere let's try it oh okay ah it works hooray Oh guys yeah man honestly after the disappointment of the sour patch kids tropical I was really thinking that this was not gonna be a good idea flavors that on paper sound great pineapple fruit punch didn't really work didn't work for me at least watermelon on paper in my mind it's dicey that was dicey already but then again this products been around for years it's got its own packaging just for the one flavor that speaks volumes I would say that says this is a flavor that works you know and thank goodness it does guys it totally does the sour it's not overly sour maybe I don't know if sour patch kids do different levels of sour on their different products because this doesn't taste this sour as those tropicals did last week but maybe I'm just misremembering I think though what it really is is that the sour mesh's really well with the watermelon flavor to be fair it's not overly watermelon even like it's there it's there but it's also like it's like um it's not like you're a watermelon Jolly Rancher it's more like watermelon bubblegum where it's still kind of gum flavored it just has a little bit of watermelon on it you know this is mostly gummy sugar flavor little watermelon on it and a little sour on it not overly strong in the water mom not overly sour but a nice even even sort of sweetness throughout I got to say it works really well surprisingly well for someone who doesn't always tend to - watermelon flavored I think this has succeeded so I guess if you're a watermelon fan or a sour patch kids fan this is definitely recommend give it a whirl sour patch kids have a standard did I like to think that they always stay up and stay up - I would say that last week's review of sauerkraut kids tropical was my first kind of real disappointing sort of experience with the entire sour patch kids brand I'm really pleasantly surprised and happy that the sour patch kids watermelon has redeemed it so good for use to our patch kids I can certainly forgive a misstep with the tropical watermelon is good walking the candy aisle is gonna reach sour patch kids watermelon a very strong four out of five go check them out you know I'd still probably go for the sour patch kids original over this but you know to each his own if you're a watermelon fan give this a shot even if you're not I would recommend giving this a shot thanks very much for watching everyone stay tuned for next week's review we're gonna be doing the sour patch kids mango mango mango flavor that's the new one so uh yeah thank you all for your time and leave

"[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you

already done that though next is the mixing since these are sugar free will be using xylitol so first to get half a cup of xylitol okay and the next you'll have half a teaspoon of cream of tartar okay guys I screwed up and accidentally put half a tablespoon in but hopefully it'll be fine so yeah okay next will be 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid just in case you're wondering use cream of tartar there sick citric acid fabric okay so yeah here it oh okay so just gonna get that again one time we put too much citric acid in then what you're gonna do is you're gonna mix it all around so then next what we do is we stick this thing and then we stick it like right there like in the middle of the oven and it's pretty hot as you can see 25 minutes hmm so then you cook it for 25 minutes and then you start it yay okay so you have to do this part very quickly so what we're doing is we're putting coconut spray inside I like you know like the lollipop molds right now so then what I got to do is you know like I'm gonna get like one drop of red food coloring and then one drop whoa that's fine it'll do it'll just be it'll just be red then I guess and then no and then the flavor will be Barbie and then I put Barbie and cream in and then you'll need to mix it up and then what we'll do is we're pour it in there okay so we put the liquid in the lollipop molds and we uh put the lollipop sticks there now just let it dry for four hours", "_30uaj8BWMM": "so this video just occurred to me i was i was getting ready to start uploading it editing a few videos i recorded and there's this really interesting candy i'm out of them currently and i normally always have a box of these on me i love them they're from japan i get them off of j list although you'll probably want to go to j box calm family friendly version of the site these are these is just basic like something you'd find old people eating in America hard candies and I got it just because I hadn't tried the really basic flavor by this company now there's I had sake flavor I've had a stir soup flavored miso soup floater I go for interesting stuff and here's some other examples sushi drops yeah and they did they did taste like sushi they're just little white hard candies the these ones were the colors that you see on the box but every every other kind of my beatings been a white hard candy um let's say there's a little website go told chigi room a dot-com go Toto chigi roommate huh well I'll just keep getting them from j-list I don't plan on going to the website up well it's real hard to see on this camera call all kanji so I don't know what's in them probably not the safest thing to do eat something you don't know what's in it but we all do it anyway with fast food and everything else so here's another example this one I had to get all the cameras gone all blurry on me for a second threw it out of focus yep there we go not two drops now i'm not going to show every one of these I've tried I've tried a lot but I had to try not to because supposedly it's acquired taste an acquired taste that only Japanese like and the foreigners can't stain yet it's supposed to be extremely nutritious and served at most Japanese tables so I had to try this they for breakfast at least that I know of probably other times too and when you watch these videos of people would have moved to Japan's an hour's warning it means not too very hard to get used to it took me a while by the end of the box i was enjoying them well 10 10 like the old tins you would find powdered mixes for nestle used to do powdered mixes in these mountains when i was little natto fermented beans so no alcoholic content that I'm aware of I've only had the candy though I'm not gonna say what it tastes like I'm just gonna say most foreign people from America so I guess if you're in Americans Americans you just say that foreign because you know people aren't from Japan and in that sense most non-japanese live in America would have a palette of flavors to select from that would not compare babe their taste buds would not be used to anything like it's fermented even saying that throws you off and leaves you unprepared you've got to be ready if you're going to be eating around others and trying it I would advise against that but be ready with a palate cleanser like pickled ginger that way if you decide after it touches your tongue it's a flavor you can't have in your mouth you can just swallow it real quick popin the pickled ginger and avoid embarrassing yourself or others or making anyone uncomfortable um so it can be a fun kind of I dare you to eat thing for people that aren't used to it don't make fun of it though it is kind of a cultural staple of Japan so it would be really impolite to use it as that in front of Japanese individuals um it is worth getting used to because it does have a lot of health benefits from what I've read and heard really good for you and if you're going to be spending time in Japan there's probably going to be a lot of it around and if you can eat it without embarrassing or annoying or hurting the feelings of Japanese individuals they would probably greatly appreciated be surprised and it would make for an interesting conversation the gaijin or foreigner that eight not telling didn't flinch I can't now I'm fairly confident um I got used to the flavor and and I want to try the real thing I have never seen it on a menu in American restaurant so yeah uh any of you that may have tried not oh please please share your not stories with me and experiences or even if you know someone that did share what they told you and if you tried any of these or the other flavors and if you know what these hard candies I'm talking about our please share your stories they did feature them in the anime grave of fireflies and I think there's a live-action film of that out now um and Jay list or Jay box calm Jay box is the one will not get you in trouble for viewing you you may have something pop up on screen that could cause issue if you're on jail is so make sure you go to the right one both will sell these though candy drops sakuma drops also could we might need fruit I'm not sure I can't remember my Japanese isn't very good this says it actually contains fruit juice I can tell because the English side I am no good with hiragana katakana kanji I'm trying I'm trying my pen pals helping me with some kanji least I think they're conscious you might be teaching me hiragana katakana haven't asked anyway he's funny funny very interesting on flavors the odd flavors make for great little ice breakers and conversations you know with people you having a slow day like one of those still in college had a little trouble staying awake a candy that tastes like sushi or or oyster soup will certainly be interesting and keep you awake and get you back in the moment of listening to whatever lecture what have you so it's it's nice to always have ten of these around really good stuff and they don't go bad easy so storm at room temperature you'll have to put on my fridge or nothing like that hope you enjoyed the video I highly recommend these are fun to eat interesting adventures and usually good I ended up liking all the flavors I've tried thank you for watching", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "6eOw9MLpuKA": "[Music] 20 I'm back with an overview I am at the auditorium or whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I

candy this documentary film is dedicated to an earthing the mysteries of this peculiar sweet in salons and barbershops around the world a bowl of candy is often present x to the cash register the average dimensions of the bill may vary but the bill almost never contains more than 100 pieces of candy here to talk with us about the ratios of candy within this fixed barrel environment is mathematician and statistician juror important from numerous surveys and barber shops and salons across America my team and I have concluded that the standard candies president candy bowls are caramels peppermints and strawberry shaped hard candies these sweets are usually present in a 1 2 3 2 ratio of peppermint to caramel to strawberry shaped hard candy this means that one sixth of the bowl is comprised of caramel one half is comprised of peppermint and the remaining third is comprised of strawberry shaped hard candy however statistics also show you if only 0.0000 0000 1% of the population has ever tasted the candy this means that less than one half of a person has ever sampled the sweet also here to talk about candy statistics is Oprah love Shuang a hair stylist with field experience well I have been in the candy industry for over 10 years now and I've always been a support charity ball however I've always kept track of my purchases even candy purchases and never have I once placed order for strawberry sheriff Callie's but they always seem to dominate the bowl and I have noticed super small nation even though nobody takes any candy it always seems to disappear from the gun a question arises from this elegance where is this candy come from and where is it go to this evidence suggested the canteens never bought in stores never consumed in fact in a recent study conducted by dr. are as Faust who's proven that strawberry candies do not come from shops strawberry tart can is truly disappear and reappear and this activity should be recordable I took a series of videos that monitor cannibals containing only strawberry shaped candies these candies were taken from nearby barbershops and hair salons the footage is stunning as you can see the strawberries gradually disappear over a period of 15 days then reappears suddenly on the 16th this cycle repeats indefinitely this study proves that strawberry shake cod candies are buzzing with supernatural activity one brave soul has considered the sample in one of these candies perhaps she would Lynch the world beyond from which these confections come her name is Geraldine Samantha the testing room in which samantha is sampling the candy is made up of triple reinforced steel and his void of all equipment that could possibly be damaged it appears that the subject has changed form luckily he is locked in secure contained environment what's that oh yes all right it appears that the creature has disappeared oh yes the camera is back online well I didn't ever to make this for now all of a

because it you know it was my first time it's just for me a lot of it was just what's built out all over the cookie molds and stuff but these candies guys it calls for half a cup I believe of yeah

driving across country all the way up to Syracuse New York so you can finally hear hi I'm Craig at Hercules candy and we're gonna make hard candy there's so much to know about candy making no one person can know it all so I travel the country and I see other candy makers and I invite you to travel with Greg as we go to see Hercules candy in Syracuse New York [Music] Hercules candy is located in Syracuse New York and Steve and Terry and Craig who's off camera right now run the place and they make wonderful candy and during our Kickstarter campaign we said we'd make a joint video and we never thought we hit that level but this is the video folks and we went up there they know something about making hard candy but not about making image candy and I know absolutely nothing about making chocolate so we thought we'd trade skills I arrived in Syracuse and the GPS takes me up a lovely Street and it points me to a lovely residential house with a sign that says Hercules candy out front I guess I didn't know what to expect I'd seen their videos but I didn't realize it was in the basement of a residential house they're gonna move soon so I sort of feel lucky I got to see this old tradition where they've been making candy since the 1930s the basement is the factory the ground floor is the showroom and they live upstairs more they make the candy just like the Shemp such a mess confectionary I've never made image candy in a kitchen from the 30s so I had to figure out what they had they had a pot to cook it in a table to pour it on and let it cool a hook to pull it on and a heating hood to keep it warm it looks like they had everything but like all things this equipments gonna be different than what I'm used to so let's see what we can do we were both prepared to take notes Terry more than me she had her little notebook ready and I had my notes made for them already drawn out for this project I hope it made it a little easier before I go any further I have to state an element effect steve is a superhero superheroes have superpowers and Steve's is handling corn syrup I use ladles I use cups I transfer it in various ways and some of it always ends up on the floor he takes his bare hands plunges it into the bucket of corn syrup and moves it without dripping with his bare hands into the pot I have no idea how he does this take my word for it steve is a superhero [Music] this beautiful copper pot takes the sugar up to 310 degrees quickly and Steve and I talk about candy making and I discover we have a difference of experience for him making hard candy is not something you do in the summer it gets too sticky and for me I'm from Florida it's practically summer year-round if we hadn't figured out ways around making candy in the summer we wouldn't be in business Steve adds the flavor stirs it in and then the pot goes down to the marble candy cooling table a four inch thick marble table I never actually worked on marble before you can't control its temperature so it does what it wants to do unlike my candy cooling table and if it gets too hot it'll just stay that way until it cools down or until you ice it down to keep the mixing colors familiar to me I brought a whole stack of my little wooden spoons with me to mix the colors in oh it's cooler than in Florida the air temperature in this room might be 65 and I'm used to working at 75 everything's cooling off a lot faster than normal so I got to work fast to add the color into the candy and we do our three sections they're dark orange for the skin our light orange for the middle and our clear that will become the white for the pith of the orange this is the place I normally add citric acid Terri Steve and I decide not to you see citric acid can behave very badly when exposed to marble marble and citric acid can break down a produce carbon dioxide in fact dissolving marble dust or chips into sulfuric acid is how they made seltzer water or the carbonation for seltzer water back in the early days and you can find out more about that on our video about how to make an egg cream we don't want to damage this so we don't use the citric acid but that's okay it may be a bit sweeter than our normal orange but it's going to be delicious because we're flavoring it with pure orange oil just the way we do with lofty pursuits I cut the sugar into its three color blocks and Terry and Steve start flipping them over like experts I guess they are I know there have been jokes made by these guys about how tight the space is down there when there's only three of them well there are six today you can see four on camera and there are two more just coming to watch and to help out [Music] Steve starts the batch on the hook he's pulling it to fold and air bubbles you fold in air bubbles into candy like this it stops being amber and it starts becoming white that's because these little air bubbles reflect light beautifully we need a very white candy for the pith of the orange now what's surprising me here is that we actually made this work this room is so much colder than I'm used to not as cold as they're used to and I have to work much faster than normal for me we need to get this thing off the hook and still be warm enough to do the next couple of stages in the process at lofty I'm used to working with a heating table to keep the candy from cooling too fast but the traditional way to do it is a heating hood I never had that opportunity to work with one when I was learning because we didn't have a gas source in the building we were working with we had a deal with electrical heat a heating table is a very large area that has one temperature and it tapers off very quickly as he get off that area the heating hood has a gradual taper from the back where if the heat sources to the front whether you're working this posed some challenges for the type of image candy that I'm used to making but ends up being a huge advantage for ribbon candy and hopefully I'll show that to you in another video [Music] Terry and I start cutting the candy down the light orange is going to be the triangles in the center of the orange and we need six parts for the design that I do she takes three I take three we even them out and then we have to shape them into the triangles and cool them off and in this environment the cooling them off is not the problem [Music] Steve knows how the candy cools in his shop he comes over and starts flipping the candy I'm used to flipping it because the bottoms warm in the top skull but in this case the bottom and top on one side are cold and the bottom and top on the other side are hot and he's gotta flip it in a different way it's all different everybody's shop has its idiosyncrasies and Hercules candies is no different but I gotta say it's a lot of fun to play with the old equipment Steve earns his stripes by putting stripes in between the pith of the orange slices and we've put in the last slice on the first half and the first half of the image Candy's done the second half he assembles by himself and we are able to put both halves together and end up with the core of the orange [Music] Steve keeps the arms center Moving's that it won't go flat while I pull out the white candy into the outer layer of the pith and we wrap it around the orange slices we repeat the technique we did with the white candy on the orange rind and we end up with a beautiful outer layer then the log is rolled for a bit and we want to take the log in two rods and we pull it down we pinch it off and we stretch it out using gravity as AIRAID if you ever make it to tell a C please visit us at lofty pursuits we're right off i-10 here in Tallahassee and if you can't make it you can still buy our candy we made a batch of this orange and it's in our citrus mix and you can get that at our website www.jfn.co.jp/toho clips are amazing they're hard candies are wonderful and it's always good to have colleagues in the field that you like everybody's changing positions all the time so that everyone can have experience at each step of the process the log is being rolled to keep it round Steve is pulling it out into the lengths without distortion this is the hard part of this project and he's cutting it off in two rods Terry and other people and me at some point end up rolling the logs to keep them cool and round until they are heartened which once again he isn't very hard in this environment he can't tell a little jealous it's hot here in Florida [Music] the candy came out great sometimes if you over pull or under pull the candy or if there's too much stretching and twisting involved it becomes hard to cut but this Candy's cutting beautifully and I cut the first couple of rods and then Steve takes over and he starts learning the process like everybody who's ever learnt this technique has to it's not always as easy as it looks don't worry he'll get his revenge when he tries to teach me how to kill a chocolate mold and I thought that would have been easy I was wrong [Music] and look at how much faster he is after a few dozen rods to cut [Music] and Terry did a great job she picked this up in no time at all and then we were done and we headed upstairs and I went out towards my car with everyone else helping to carry my gear and there was somebody waiting outside apparently he'd seen the live stream he wanted to come by and get some of the hard candy the first person to try it thank you for watching this video we want to thank Hercules candies for their huge hospitality it was a

did you save any flavor yesterday yeah what you save baby baby baby for later mmm-hmm one o'clock so there's tomorrow flavors be easily be done with this by I think you a330 hmm cuz then I can pack some up and put it on the shelf I just wish I knew somebody with a camera that could take a picture of that pile when it's all mixed up with a pretty cool shot and every batch is different so this won't be yeah and that the batch we're doing today will be different from the one we did we're like what two weeks ago one week ago this and usually yeah usually you guys only do one one day of hard job yeah and then it sold out in like what two weeks maybe less is the interweb people the interweb people I liked a lot but if you could take us still yeah that would be swell cuz you're the guy how'd you know I have a camera looking right at me see you had to take things are not moving pictures you take still pictures no I can't stand still for you well be accurate representational like all ours well you did that a purpose on purpose fishing for compliments we better try really hard then hey Brad to the bone I'm gonna take my stride how do you feel that I just cleaned these petals off to the tune of jingle bells okay let's see how much color I can get on the table this time choppers got month did this duck yeah you're right it will hmm I didn't wrong this time I hope so okay if I need

I mean it all hard candy yes no chocolate we mean it oh yeah except for Saturday yeah that's already been oh yeah and then maybe like another day next but then that's it oh yeah are you guys still doing more peanut brittle okay then the only reason we didn't do more recently is because we don't have anyone to put it hmm don't have any room to put those big cases so we're gonna pack that up because basically we made three batches we solved that already huh so make three more but we knew we had to make more don't don't see chocolate-covered peanut brittle because then that's all they're gonna want cuz that's like the best thing ever it's true but don't talk about it cuz some think you should take it hopefully by the time you see this vid it'll be made yeah they're gonna want that for sure mm-hmm I bet last year normally we do like a half a batch covering chocolates to say 17 pounds ish this year we measure just do a full batch not mess around cuz if Craig does a video about it actually if you are out of town I'll just do an iPhone video yeah and what do I put that in the drop box sure email to me video will drive I think can hold up to 10 to 15 gigabytes and I think email isn't gonna handle that much well I think if you try to email it'll automatically sent to Google Drive if you try to do it through your Gmail account okay so Senate through G that makes sense because I already be on my iPhone anyway yeah yep until you do it and then I'll be able to edit it on my new laptop that's coming in today yep and when I'm out of town I can still work on the youtubes I love

called with Brandi candy peeps am anyway me my brother my brothers", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "jkSZSq2uhwE": "hey guys I'm back and one I didn't want to show before is this I'm guessing that's another hard candy got matcha um yuzu and looks just like a Japanese citrus fruit and this is other brown sugar because it says brown sugar on the back or it's what some of my viewers have told me which is the black cane sugar and black cane sugar has a distinct taste to it so long I guess I'll let you know so and because Japan is oh so cool got a little grippy thingy here excuse me okay so we're going to start with a muck ja back so actually kind of cute hold individual bags look at that okay then this up what it looks like it looks better on camera weird okay good it's minty I on cement in here it tastes like a green tea flavored ricola and I still can't tell if I like it or hate it I don't like the mint I don't want the mental thing to it but it doesn't it doesn't go good with a quickly cream teeth but we'll watch us specifically since it has a little rougher taste to it if I wanted a mint I would have eaten a mint coconut okay I try the yuzu yo and again it looks better on camera I guess because the Sun setting that everything's getting kind of pixely so you can't really see all the details of the looks like it was melted okay there's no mention here and it tastes like lemonade candy I like that a lot excuse me I like this one I'll eat this one anytime it's really good it's like a lemon kind of thing like a like a lemon and a grapefruit had a baby I enjoy sucking on this but I just spit it out now don't let your minds travel too much okay make up a little questionable either or since I can't read Japanese I can't tell you what it says smells more like brown sugar okay and again looks a little better on camera actually this one just looks better in general the other way the other side looks terrible okay you could say that all right here you I probably switch my mouth first before I did this you know I can't tell you guys I had to I'm gonna squish my mouth and I'll be right back it's like I can't get that mentally taste from the green tea one out of my mouth if I want to know it would have been mentholated I would have tried that one last but it was a surprise to me and I cannot get rid of that I I feel like I just brushed my teeth I don't feel like good be able to tell you exactly what this is I mean it okay from when I tasted it tastes a very sweet it tastes it tastes account like brown sugar it didn't really have that dark kind of coffee like taste to it um it was still pretty good but I can't I couldn't place my tongue on it sorry guys um but to my viewers who know Japanese well enough to understand the little characters post down and tell me what it is that I'm eating good yeah that was just I didn't like the surprise mint that was just horrible um yeah so sorry guys this is kind of a little fail um um um I blame Japan because they didn't mention the mint so I blamed Japan for this crappy video so okay well um i guess it will see me next week or something um sorry i couldn't because couldn't be any better than it was so I'm gonna take my long goodbyes and out", "neH3wA3YHyI": "it's time for some delicious strawberry candies today I'm walking the candy aisle hey guys Jeff here with her review of well I don't really have to describe it I guess these are just the strawberry hard candies right um I actually think that technically I'm not I'm sorry I was trying to figure this out I'm not 100% sure because I bought these at a bulk store but I think that these are the our core our core brand strawberry candies but there are a couple different companies that make this kind of candy I think that this will probably be familiar to most of you out there this is a hard candy strawberry flavored this kind of wrapper design has been imitated by a number of different companies I know I like I said I think this is our core is the company which I reviewed a couple of their products before in the past and they're like a parent company stay on like a lot of different brands but they're all a little like somewhat obscure brands but I think this is the our core one I think the other major one that you'll see a lot is the Brax one but the Brax one they take take care to at least now they put Brax across their strawberry candies but like this is like that standard like long-standing strawberry candy that you would have seen for years and years and years I know I always saw this at every waiting room I ever what went to as a kid I remember when I was whenever I was like where was I at the hair salon the hairdresser and I would be like waiting to get my hair cut as a kid and they would have a candy bowl there and I would always go for these ones oh they're so good and I know I mentioned these when I did my review of the para Gina linking candies because those along with these these are really the ones that were always like the special find they were kind of all over the place at any candy bowl in any like office that you had to be waiting at these were all we always seemed to be around but but they were fantastic they're just they just I always have such good memories of these kind of candies so let's let's let's have a look here you open one up and okay here you go is the rapper so obviously it looks like a strawberry which is great and it's a strawberry candy and it's a hard candy so I think these are technically the pair dark or strawberry filled bonbon candy I don't know what they're called they had some like dumb name but sorry not dumb I'm sure it's totally appropriate but you know there's strawberry hard candies the thing about these hard candies when the strawberry ones in particular is that and this is kind of the design that everyone goes with with the strawberry candy is that in the inside of this hard candy it's got either a cream or a jelly sort of a filling like like a juice filling almost right so it has that extra burst of flavor what was I just reviewing recently that had that now I can't remember some sort of uh wasn't it was some sort of a toffee a taffy candy what the heck was that oh my god guys I'm sorry I review so many candies here I'm getting them all confused anyway it doesn't really matter this one is the strawberry candy and obviously it's pretty straightforward just looks like a hard candy let's give it a shot and so right off the bat strawberry flavor he's pretty good but you're just like it's like equivalent of like a mild strawberry lollipop say kind of interesting that there were these strawberry candies and yet strawberry lollipops I don't feel like they were ever a huge thing lollipops far more often cherry flavor right okay I'm gonna get into this mm-hmm hmmm so much like the para genome as I was describing that one hard on the outside but it's about some apply to it especially as you start biting through it you really can make some headway and it's almost like a like a real softer interior and it's got all that flavor in the middle hmm now it does had extra flavor I didn't taste any actual like cream Center in this one so maybe this one is not the same as the right so when I was thinking of maybe this isn't the arc or one cuz I'm pretty sure the arc or one has a cream in it so this could just be some random you know off-brand one however it has the same like substantively it's it's more or less equivalent when you get to that softer Center it still has more flavor to it so it must have had a little juice in there or something I just I just noted that I didn't taste any like an actual like cream in the center which I know some of them really have like a like a real distinct different kind of a liquid in there right but this this must've had something in him because the flavor was is pretty strong once you get into the middle and I always loved that about these strawberry candies in the there they're so they're just so so flavorful once you get get into them I'm gonna open I'm gonna have another one see if I can hmm no not seeing any specific cream in the middle this one or jam or extra juice but it is softer and it does have the flavor so we'll just call these strawberry hard candies I still think they're great um I'm gonna go out and try and find some of those other ones though maybe I'll try the Brax cuz that's like you know sort of a top to your brand right mm-hmm but this is really good if you like hard candies these strawberry hard candies are a great one to get well I just wonder if it's maybe hard to navigate the market of them because maybe you want some specific one cuz this is clearly not the one that I remember exactly from my youth but it's almost someone that I remember from my youth you know what I mean so if you're looking for something mm-hmm I don't know this is it but for me it really brings back the memories even though it's not exactly the flavor is still all there and I gotta say it's really good anyway walking mikania I was gonna rape the strawberry hard candies I'm gonna read I'm a 4 out of 5 it's good stuff and I'm still gonna go on to search for the ones with the actual cream Center or or a little bit more juice in the middle but but that's what I think of these you guys let me know if you have memories of these or any other specific kind of hard candies down below in the comments and thanks very much for watching everyone I really appreciate it click the links you see on the screen if you'd like to see more reviews and I will talk to you next time have a good one everyone bye-bye", "qoFxagGE7Qs": "Oh [Music]", "b4tD1jFpTPo": "hello everybody and welcome back to kj steve i hope you guys are having yourselves a wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know

is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade rock candy we recently made a cake Penguins of Madagascar that used lots of rock candy and I was reading through the comments and people were asking of ways that they could make it themselves at home so I put together this video for you so let's get started so we don't need many ingredients to make the raw candy we need just 1 cup of water 3 cups of white granulated sugar now these parts are optional I've just got some colouring you can also use food coloring for this I have gel paste out in front and I also have some different flavorings and you can use them or omit them it just depends if you want your rock candy to be flavored and then we're going to be growing the rock candy on these little wooden sticks you could also use popsicle sticks or you could also use cake pop sticks so the first thing we're going to do is bring our cup of water to a boil which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit so once the water is boiling just turn it down slightly and then by the 1/2 cup we're going to add the sugar so I'm just going to add 1/2 cup here and probably start off with a cup here and then I'm just going to stir it and I'm going to keep stirring and letting the sugar in here dissolve while I'm stirring it we're gonna get the 3 cups of water in or sorry the 3 cups of sugar into the water which is going to saturate it and that's going to be how the rock candy forms so I'm just gonna keep stirring and adding the sugar and it looks like it's dissolved from that first addition so I'm just going to add some more and then keep going so I have all of my sugar in it's nice and thick and the sugar is dissolved into the water mixture so now I'm going to just give it a final couple stirs and I'm going to set it to the side for about 15 minutes to let it cool and in the meantime I'm going to set up the where the rock candy is going to grow so what we need to do next is give a surface for the rock candy to grow on so I'm taking my wooden sticks and I'm just dipping them into the water here just dipping the stick and making it wet and then I'm going to roll it in this white extra sugar so you don't need too much you can tap it off and this is just going to give the rock candy something to stick to and so like I said it's gonna help it grow so just stick it in the water and then dip it into the sugar so we're gonna let those dry and wait for our mixture to slightly cool so what I've got set up are small narrow glasses and if you you can use anything that's kind of like long and cylinder like this in order to help grow the rock candy and what you're going to do is if you want one to be color just gonna put a drop in to the bottom you don't need very much because it is quite a small amount so I've got some blue and some pink coming in here and if you want coloring or sorry if you want flavoring if you want to have one flavour for all of your rock candy you could put it in while before you take it off the heat but I want to show you how to make different flavors so I'm just going to put a little drop as small as I can get here into that blue one there and then change the flavor and put another drop in the second one so this third one that's on my right here I'm just going to leave it plain because the clear rock candy also looks kind of cool so I've transferred my sugar mixture to a container that I can pour from and the mixture is still hot you just want to make sure you've given it a little time to cool down slightly so we're going to do is just pour into my containers here and then I'll give them a stir so I'm filling it you want to leave a little bit of room for this for the stick to go in there and just give it a little stir so it mixes up all of the color and the flavor I'm just going to repeat that with all three and then I'll show you what to do with the sticks so what I have are large clothes pegs you could also use the regular sized ones these ones are just like because they have a little hole in the middle which just happens to fit perfectly with the stick so what you want to do now is you want to put the stick right into the center of the mixture but you don't want it to touch the bottom so what I did is I just go down to the bottom so I can feel the bottom and then bring it back up a bit because if you put your stick too low then the candy won't be able to grow as far as you want it to grow so that's as simple as it is and then you're gonna leave them for at least two to three days in order for any candy to grow and some of mine I left for a couple of weeks and so I'm going to be bringing those ones out to show you and I will show you how to get them out of the container after this so these rock candy growths have been growing for about two weeks and what you want to do at that point is take them off take off the little clothes cake and then the surface is hard so you just want to break it and you can do that with just a butter knife and make sure that you're not breaking it right by the stick and then you want to dump the excess out here like that and then inside you can see that the rock candy has grown around the little post here but unless you're really lucky you might have problem getting it out so what I've had success with is just holding hot water from the tap along the bottom of my container here and then gently prying it away once it gets a little bit soft so I'm going to go and do that and I'll show you the final product so I have the piece of blue rock candy out now and it's all ready to be eaten and I'm going to take the rest of mine out as well and I'll be back to show you all the finished colors so there you go everybody how to make your own homemade rock candy it was a pretty simple tutorial today but something that's really cool that you may not have done before so I hope you enjoyed it and you learn something new so thanks for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "YfvV3eknOA4": "these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimeters long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L & O of B and E a why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops", "e2K7IYB74rU": "well guys

thank you very much bye", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on

it looks like inside and we're going to try any matcha green tea I'm not sure exactly what that says it might even say matcha green tea but I might even say something else something ridiculously close that's what looks like mmm both sides they're hard candies mmm anybody ever had green tea ice cream this is delicious Oh ma'am yeah oh good my tongue likes this it's like green tea ice cream minus the extremely creamy part that's still sweet this is really good I gotta spit it out now okay I'll look even have a poly content of each layer and stuff the mystery one what does that say people might find out right after this I might you'll even more confused but she just like the last one a different color coffee brown sugar tastes like coffee and brown sugar what am i eating it's really good though it tastes like somebody sweeten their coffee with rona sugar that's exactly what it tastes like it's really good mmm two more umeboshi pickled plum yeah I forgot if I mention that to you pickled plum salted plum okay okay so the the little Sesame's are actually in the room I oh she look at that huh do you think of everything don't they mmm you know I'm glad it is a second to last this one's horrible you could days the saltiness I'm with sweetness and you could taste a sesame just slightly amazing with how much how much lesson is in here it certainly takes it very much very well

on my porch swing again because for whatever reason my camera will not focus in my living room so I'm gonna do more videos outside for as long as I can or until I can get some decent filming lighting anyway that's boring this video is about candy if you don't know I love candy I am a big candy enthusiast and for Father's Day I ordered from Hercules candies this box is empty these chocolates are long gone trust me I was going to do a taste testing video on these chocolates but I ate them before I could get my camera out they were delicious Hercules candies I will definitely be ordering from them again in the future delicious but today I have a different box of candies I ordered this from lofty pursuits so lofty pursuits is a toy store slash candy maker slash old-fashioned soda fountain and if I'm ever in tallahassee florida i am certainly going to go visit that place looks like so much fun but they are known for their image candy which is a little hard piece candy with an image inside of it and i am so happy that i have my box of image candy i'm filming over here so I have three different items in this box I haven't opened yet I have not seen anything yet I'm really really excited so I ordered a assortment of image candies I have no idea what's going to be included I am hoping for banana I am hoping for peach I am hoping for the crystal-clear flower type candies that they make I will link his channel in the description so you know what I'm talking about so I bought three different packs I have a coffee flavored one which they just showed on their channel and I immediately bought it and they say it's based off of a Hawaiian flavor to coffee which is what clueless Laver is based off of so I have a feeling it's gonna taste a lot like chocolate milk because that's what Kahlua tastes like to me so kind of a chocolate milk with maybe a hint of coffee is what I'm thinking it will taste like and then I got two different assortments I got an image candy assortment and then I got a rare flavor assortment and I bought that one because it has the nectar flavor in it and the nectar flavor is like a really rare flavor it's like a secret recipe flavor and everybody tastes it differently they taste like butterscotch to some people they can taste like other stuff to other people so I'm really interested in what that will taste like so I'm going to open my box and I'm going to taste the candy [Applause] here's the coffee flavored ones I'm gonna take one out and I will show you the image inside it is a steaming cup of coffee how cute is that oh it's so cute I absolutely love this image candy and now I'm gonna try it here is my little coffee cup image candy I'm going to need to taste it for the first time right now oh my gosh it's so good that very first taste when it hits your taste buds is just like coffee and then the sweetness of the sugar comes out and it does really tastes a lot like Kahlua that's delicious it's not what I expected actually it's more of a coffee flavor than I expected so that's awesome it's really good and nobody in my family likes coffee so these are all mine and I don't have to share them this is the rare flavor assortment and this says nectar it has rose it has blackcurrant which I'm very interested in trying  do you say current or current cuz for some reason I keep calling it current and I think it's actually current I don't know what do you guys say current or current now let's look at our assorted image candy see what see what images we have cherries we have lime that one's gonna be good I cannot wait to eat that lime one can you see it right there lime so cute and I can't really see any other one so I'm gonna have to open it and look through because I see some orange ones and if those are peach I'm going to be very happy here's one of my assorted candies and I think it's supposed to be grapefruit but I actually don't know what this one is this is the lemon one and this one as you can see has pink in the middle so I think this is going to be pink grapefruit and here's a lemon one here's a watermelon one I'm very excited I love watermelon it's one of my favorite candies I have an orange I got a couple of peach I'm so happy because I love peach flavor I have a grape there's my grape I have a cherry I think this is a blueberry here's a lime you can see how translucent it is in the Sun I'm thinking Apple I'm actually not sure what this one is I have a cute little strawberry it could be a raspberry but I'm pretty sure it's strawberry I have two teeny pieces of banana banana is one I love banana candy I hate actual bananas what's weird I will not just pick up a banana peel it and eat it but banana candy even banana bread I love and this guy is root beer and you can see right through the mug there how flippin cute is that that is some serious adorableness like how am i supposed to even eat is it so pretty and repairs and other flavor that I really like in candy so which one should I eat first I'm going to try I'm gonna try the lime one first got my lime candy here [Applause] they add citric acid to some of their fruity flavors to give it more of a sour bite to make it more authentic flavor great job it tastes really good if it wouldn't have had that tartness to it it would not have tasted like a lime this is really good this Candy's going to be gone in like three days flat I can't control myself around the candy this is really good this lime flavor I mean you've eaten lime flavored things all the time skittles and Jolly Ranchers and whatever but really good flavor I'm going to try the grapefruit looking one next is it a grapefruit eye I have no idea it doesn't have as much citric acid as the lime one did and I can't tell what flavor it is I'm not really getting much of a fruity flavor it's more just like the sugar candy itself it does taste a little bit like a citrus so I'm sticking with my grapefruit theme that's what I think it is maybe a tangerine I'm kind of getting a tangerine note it's a mystery and that was the only piece of that kind of candy that I had so it's going to remain a mystery here we have the you rare flavor assortment I am losing my sunlight here the trees have me in the shade but we have four flavors this one is grape this one is rose this one is nectar and this one is war hound and I only got two pieces of war hound in my assortment and that's okay with me it's not one of my favorite flavors I don't even remember what it tastes like but I do know it's kind of like sassafras and it's just an old flavor that isn't really used much anymore so these are the rarest Orman's i'm gonna go ahead and try the nectar and the rose so first i'm going to start with a nectar because it's the one I am most curious about and like I said earlier different people taste different things when they eat it so hopefully it's something that I like so let's see if I can identify any specific flavors in this nectar candy it's so different of a flavor I can't really compare it to anything I'm getting like a hint of honey flavor and a hint of maybe clothes just a tiny hint of clove maybe it's cinnamon it's really good though it's definitely nothing I've ever tasted before like it almost reminds me of something but I don't know what it is very unique I definitely recommend it I like it it's so different the last piece I'm gonna try is the Rose flavor from the rare flavor assortment and I'm guessing it's just gonna taste like the rose flower it is flavored with rose oil so it should taste like rose right it's really subtle it's good but it's a really subtle rose set and it's not like overly floral a lot of the natural sugar flavor is kind of overpowering the rose flavor which i think is a good thing because Rose is not really a typical flavor that people would go for so having it really subtle I think it was a good move on their part you can definitely taste the rose oil in it but it's not disgusting you know hmm I bet my daughter will love this flavor if I decide to actually share I don't share very well when it comes to my candy so each of these bags were 2.75 ounces and they cost $5.99 each this kind of Candy's gonna cost you guys it's very labor intensive and ingredients can be hard to find sometimes so I completely understand the price of these little packs being as high as they are I don't think it's unreasonable you know the image candy especially a lot of work goes into that it's good and it's it's worth it for me anyways next flavor I'm going to try is the black currant and if you're interested in candy history at all lofty pursuits is very much a history buff when it comes to candy and the history of why the US doesn't have a lot of black currant flavors you know how popular grape flavors are here that's how it is in other countries it's the black currant that is the most leading flavor so I'm going to try this little purple candy oh it's so good so much better than great if you mix a blackberry with a cranberry that's the flavor of blackcurrant and it has that little bite of citric acid in it and it's really really delicious I'm glad that my bag is mostly blackcurrant flavor it's so good this might actually be my favorite flavor plus it's purple and you all know how I feel about purple and just for fun to remind me what it tastes like I'm gonna try my one of two pieces of horehound candy I have seen the horehound flavor and other candies so it's not something I've never seen before I just don't remember what it tastes like so I'm gonna try it very black licorice she I don't remember a horehound tasting like black licorice sub um black licorice is something you either love or hate and I actually hate black licorice this is like a minty black licorice definitely glad I only got two pieces in my bag because it's like if you put toothpaste on a strand of black licorice and you ate it that's what this tastes like is this a normal horehound flavor see now I'm curious I'm gonna have to go try another candy that's horehound flavored to see if this is what it tastes like I don't remember it being like a black licorice very interesting [Music]", "elzKnB-7pes": "baby I'm supposed to be meant to just be trying out these lovely new candies all the way from America man goddamn pilot you know what it is because I'm hungry and

favorite was the tits Ebola Ebola because that's too hot that tastes like this is too spicy for me so I'm gonna say this you know what I'm actually gonna say gobstoppers as well I would have said Chester's but they're not really that exciting that I've a spicy as I thought it'd be right it looks more spicy in the packet so gobstoppers I would say definitely okay so I wouldn't like by them no

meatball think so because I did my little thing like I'm always going to see some PC really well so I'm the Pictou sister a katydid here doing the goo on his show bloody wheelchair guru show what are we going to be doing this time over candy we got in some 4 different kinds of candy it's a sweet shop favourite from bonds of London so Bob London since 1895 so what the producer City London's the city of the camera off the country he's goofy that's how I used to goofy weird sugar so let's see we have to try we have goober mustard these are both candies we have black could and licorice we have some delectable flute shoes and the flea would eat the we deeper because it needs something of hitting powder if you remember and healing Potter what was Dumbledore his password to get into his office it was to boot lemon so we're gonna see that one and try it laughs okay so we'll put that down here if your tours of eat all that stuff so we're gonna try the boot choose first so a plan yeah got a here week there you just had a shower everybody's so oh and then individually wrapped in the package so there's a couple different flavors in here so it took a couple oh there's a shower there's three different ones that I see nice a flushing shower so we got three times in that bad betrayal take although I've been one like a Stover's cloudy yeah I'll get your flesh bone how bad can you go mmm that's very good do you like that one mmm next up we have a foolish like I said that you know for here the states very similar to latest overs but these are softer and failure lots of flavor [Music] I can make discoveries it's a juicy wow that's really good no my trade was good that's wait then it'll take a a great quality great nope raspberry didn't they have the wrong picture bottom I like that very soon where you try raspberry drink you need to drink no that's not mine oh the lemonade lemonade he wants his lemony okay let's fund the two ones what do you think Howard I really like these Gucci ones Billy the fiddle you know tell you what they didn't taste overly sugary they they tasted very good some the others some yeah these are really good hey I think this is probably still the original recipe from 1895 so Bob's our London futures we get a good thumbs up - don't we - like those Wow will you do that so those are pretty good so we're gonna move on to the hard candies so we'll start out this is the first one that we ordered first when we got into the black hoodie and licorice then open safety first so let me close that back up so nobody gets sliced and diced boom these are big you know take your watch but I'm gonna get a couple tissues you so well just taste a full minute up the stalks you see all the vehicles going buying they're kinda a little bit I'll take us you ready me what I wasn't sure on that but that's really good try that one I've seen that one for later said it was very good mmm what do you think do you like it do you like well sorry about that he's getting spit all over the place unfortunately have to spin out so he could test the other ones so the next one what you think of that one by the way that would have good flavor to it that was in the big I they expect them to be that big any day but the other 100 second now this one has like a sugary powder coating on it does it get a little sour they're all Fleming it's rhubarb and custard how is that takes a moment for the flavors or so to develop them once it's in there mmm mommy well the beautiful camera lady is a hewing now this is just me and him to his production she's in giving his mother a shower yes okay so we're on to the last one the one you've been dying to try right yes is this the one this is the one he found this one and just had to have him so he placed the order and he got it in all the way from England England great country yes England is the country in London great city yeah someday daggoo will go to London and we'll do all kinds of videos of London right yeah the sweeter sour oh man put it in you wait a minute wait a minute and then awesome boom lemony flavor 10 nice sweetness to it hmm you know what I'm glad we say this once to last because this way I don't have to sit this one out I can finish this one you want to finish this one so what do you think about the London Eye he's pretty clear to us why they've been in business since 1895 it's excellent in phenomenal I like that mmm so do they get the - Lucio Galoob oh yeah what did you like better these or the willy wallaby licorice you these Wow what does that tell you because you know much we leaved about Willy wallaby licorice juice we started with excellent they did taste over sugary overly processed like you know there was a big fall on Fleet Feet flavor you could actually really taste illusion and lemon in those and though in the rad series seeing what these Wow huh yeah I think so there you have it folks the goofy wheelchair guru and I his feet little sister Nicci dad give

3/4 cup add your corn syrup 1/2 a cup add 3/4 cup of can of butter to a pan put it in the pan started on medium heat put your candy thermometer in and sit here and stir the candy mixture until your candy thermometer reaches 275 when your candy thermometer reaches 275 you take it off the heat and quickly stir in your box of jell-o whatever kind of jello you want but work quick stir that in mix it really well and then you can pour it in your sprayed candy molds spray them really well or you can lay it on a cookie sheet and make it like rock candy just spray your cookie sheet down with nonstick cooking spray and then pour your candy on there when you're done let it cool crack it add powdered sugar so it don't stick together same thing with your candy molds when it's cool take it out of the candy mold sprinkle it with powdered sugar I got my candy going right now I'm gonna show ya I'm gonna use raspberry jello getting it to the 275 time almost done", "ARd8oVjSftc": "hey guys what's up and welcome back to nostalgia unboxings today i have an interesting item i ordered some handmade candies from the lofty pursuits website if you don't know what uh lofty pursuits is it is uh it is another youtube channel albeit one much bigger than mine currently is that uh they make candy essentially because uh i guess the guy his name is greg owns a little candy shop uh down in florida and he decided to start filming the candy making process and it's really cool i'm a big fan of the channel just uh i like watching it before i go to sleep kind of at night when they make a new episode although because of the uh current events they have not been able to make an episode recently since you know they can't open the shop because of uh corona i don't think so that kind of blows but yeah it's uh so he gives a whole rundown of like the whole candy making process he shows it from step one all the way until it's all nice and done in little candy form and it's really interesting like a lot of the history behind certain flavors certain candy shapes stuff like that it's all you know stuff you don't really think about and then you hear it and you go wow that's a lot more interesting than i expected it to be since we're just talking about like a congealed brick of sugar but yeah it's a pretty great channel they tape this thing up really well so uh i have three okay that definitely went through i have three different flavors here today inside this box or at least i should unless they mess something up there we go using my animal strength i have popped open the box whoa okay so uh i'm going to move the box out of the camera since there's a exposed slip with some information at the very bottom so these are the bags they're not too big i guess but it also depends on how fast you go through candy if you have some uh self-control then you could make these last for quite a while uh the total price was i think i paid like 25 bucks honestly like including shipping for all three of these bags which isn't terrible considering they're all you know nice handmade uh candies in small batches and the cool part is most of these you can actually go to their channel and watch it being made which is freaking cool like that's so cool to me i don't know it's not something you really ever get to see with any other food more or less i mean unless you're like the hibachi girl but this is candy so the three flavors i picked out um i went for the more kind of unique interesting stuff so we have these um these are the whorehound and marshmallow cough drops you see they have like it says cough right there uh these are a lot of the candies also he makes on like machines that are like 200 years old um from like back in the victorian era which is awesome and that includes these like cough drop actual um well you can't see it's on this side the cough drop stamps which is really really cool but we will start with these ones i will keep all the other flavors secret for when we actually get to them delightfully devilish so it pops open it's a nice receivable bag too which i gotta give them credit that's a really really nice touch i do have a little paper towel so i do not accidentally get any sticky candy on my uh on my little filming surface here which is also doubles as my bed so it says what is that dullen i think it says dahlin it's very hard to mullen there we go it says mullen i can see it now so that was the original company that owned the press that they're using now which is pretty cool oh sorry about that and then cough so i'm going to try this right now and let you know what i think of it oh okay so in the video he explained what hor hound actually tastes like i very much agree with what he said he said that it's a very licorice flavor and it is a very very licorice flavor if you're not a fan of licorice i would definitely not i'll not get the hounded marshmallow ones there's also no marshmallow flavor at all to them because um they're not actually flavoring it with marshmallow they're just using the actual marshmallow root from the plant that it's derived from and rather than giving flavor i guess what it does and what they used it for back in the day so they use basically an original recipe for this it was um it kind of moistens up your throat to help relieve your coughing and um yeah it works personally i am a fan of licorice so these are delicious [Applause] really like them um i'm sure you know your grandparents might enjoy these types of flavors more than a lot of the zoomers out there but these are good i'm really satisfied with these ones jump cut it took me took me just a little while to finish crunching up that uh candy so this video didn't take three hours next up we have pickle dill pickle flavored candy i'm a big um i love like dill pickle flavors being a a slav so to speak hailing from lithuania i am a huge fan of all these kinds of pickley things so i'm assuming i will actually enjoy this one even though the flavor does sound very weird pop the bag open we have little pickle itself kind of translucent no fancy um stamp on it or anything and now let's get right to it okay so it doesn't taste as much of like as the pickle itself if that makes sense it tastes more like kind of the brine what the pickle would be and you know in the jar very kind of vinegary acid flavor and honestly yeah i like it it's really good man i'm i'm pretty used to like super weird flavors i guess so maybe these don't phase me as much as they would someone else who you know grabs a piece of candy and wants it to taste like candy i guess the stereotypical candy flavor rather than pickle juice but yeah they're really good um i should also add that this video is in no way sponsored my lofty pursuits i'm just a fan of the channel and always wanted to you know try some of the candy that i watched them making and thought hey that made a good video i think so here we are i also show off their logo here this is a a caricature of greg himself the owner who provides all the voicing for the the videos on the channel seems like a great guy he has such a relaxing voice too so 10 out of 10 on that front but yeah lofty pursuits and you can buy these candies if you want um they are made pretty small batches so i can't guarantee that all these can these same flavors will be available when you guys go on there but they have like 50 flavors at any one time more or less so you should be fine finding something that will tickle your fancy so it'll be at www.pd.net and i'll link to that also in the description and stuff for sure the actual candy store i believe is called public displays of confection and it's in tallahassee florida as greg states in every video and a final jump cut hopefully we move on to the final flavor and what i think is gonna be the weirdest one because i actually don't even know exactly what the flavor is this is the um forbidden fruit candy is what they called it and it might be hard to see i will try to pull one out but these are actually these are based on tide pods uh hopefully not the actual flavor of tide pods because i can only imagine that going very bad but uh i guess they made their own flavor mixed something up in house that tasted very strange and unique and maybe what you would expect a tide pod to taste like given its colors and here we go it kind of looks like a berry i think used um a berry drop mold for this since they didn't they probably didn't have their own like special tide pod molds but they did swirl all the candy around with the color so you know it kind of gets the point across especially on this side and i'm kind of nervous because i really hope this actually tastes good and they didn't just like pull an epic prank on everyone here but uh oh them it's really tart it's like sour i did not expect that what are these other flavors it's definitely it's definitely berries some sort of berries i'm gonna go out on a limb and see maybe maybe like raspberry flavor but there's definitely like several things mixed in here but the tartness definitely makes me think of like blue raspberry maybe lemonade it's really good though it's super fruity and soury so if you're into any of those kinds of flavors just to be right up your alley it's really really good honestly out of all three of these this is my favorite one um i'll probably rank the pickle one last even though i did enjoy it but i did enjoy the other ones a bit better i really do like the licorice flavor of this one it's very like i don't know it kind of makes you relax when you're eating it it's just like on one of those like chill flavors i guess if that makes any sense i don't know maybe i'm just a really weird eater and can associate flavors with kind of feelings and stuff but um yeah this one is really good but this is definitely this definitely takes the cake because it's a very these are very simple flavors where it's like you know just kind of briny and acidy and this one's just pure licorice almost whereas this one has like it's really complex it's got all those weird fruit notes going around there like that lemonade blue raspberry vibe and then that citric acid the sourness it was really good ah here forbidden fruit two uh i guess they made a couple versions of this and um because the first one from what i understand what it said on the site was a limited run and but it was like so much that they're like you know we gotta make it again and then they made it again and we got this and it is good so it works and uh congratulations to pd.net and lofty pursuits aha see they don't tell us so it says artificial flavors natural and artificial colors make me just a coconut oil huh i don't think i've ever seen them actually put coconut oil into candy on the on the channel so i wonder if that's like maybe like a lubricant or something but yeah that's very good i will probably finish this candy this particular one off screen but that's about it for the video this really didn't come in handy at all i guess but uh thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed watching me test these kind of very strange and somewhat historic candy flavors i'm really thankful that they actually all ended up being good and i didn't like throw up on camera because that would be bad but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed and if you aren't a subscriber already i would really appreciate it if you hit that subscribe button like or disliked and dropped a comment you know telling me what you think do you think these candies are good have you tried them do you want to try them uh are you a fan of lofty pursuits in general stuff like that it would all be great to hear since my comments seem to have not been very active so far and i would like to just interact with people because i think it's fun to you know hear other people's opinions and whatnot so yeah uh see you guys make a new video every saturday so i hope to see you there next time everyone have a good one bye bye [Music] you", "3QMf4ZOpJKU": "my name is Willie Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "cYKLWo_G95A": "hey everybody how you doing welcome back to sweet freaks candy thanks for checking out our youtube channel i'm here today doing a little video on a hard candy i'm making for a halloween mix and we are starting with a grape so this has already been um the flavor is already in the pot as well as the color and this one is grape i'm going to add some citric acid to it to give it a nice little sour taste so we'll have a sour grape music in the background i hope that doesn't [Music] so what i do first is now that i've poured it onto the candy cooling table i'm going to let it sit for just a minute to cool off just a bit because if i add the citric acid now there's a good chance that it could burn and give it a little bit of a funky flavor so i like to wait a little bit and then um can go from there so uh once the edges start getting a little bit um harder see how i'm able to kind of pull that off the cooling table so it's starting to cool down a little bit and like i said i'm using a grate today this is from uh lorann oils so we're using a grape flavoring and corn syrup pretty much the main ingredients there sugar obviously so we boil it to 310 degrees drop it on here it's probably cooling off enough now that i'm gonna add some citric acid and this is what gives it that nice little sour flavor and it kind of looks like a lot you're thinking oh man but uh actually kind of dissolves into the candy a little bit as well and and uh isn't too bad so once i do that i like to fold it in so i kind of make this little pocket here i'm going to trap all that citric acid into there and then this is the part where you actually let the candy do the work i fold it in and as you can tell it's starting to harden up a little bit already this is probably make about a two and a half pound batch but as i fold it in and do this and it starts to uh the citric acid will dissolve into the candy and once i get it to a consistency that i like we'll take it over to the heating table where we can um pull and cut it so this will be for a handout that i'm doing for a farmer's market um on halloween so i'm actually gonna be hanging out my own candy so let's be a little mix for all the kids to come and get it back for me and this is the part where i just kind of let the candy do the work [Music] you still see some of that citric acid in there we're also going to pull it a little bit to give it that uh what it does is it traps air bubbles inside of it and gives the candy a little bit more uh volume to it and also it won't be as hard even though it's a hard candy um we're gonna pull it enough to where it's got some air into it so it's not going to just uh be completely solid and break a tooth if you bite into it so it'll kind of crumble it also distributes the flavor and the acid evenly so as you can tell now i'm starting to get kind of a little bit more consistency to it almost like a play-doh and at this point it's still very hot um but i can kind of manipulate it this is where i'll pull it a little bit and i don't want to pull it too much because trapping the air bubbles inside of this candy what it does is it also reflects light so the more that you pull it the lighter and more pastel the candy's going to get and for a halloween candy i want this purple to be pretty dark i have done some other ones where i've pulled the candy and made it very light and added black um coloring to it and like a stripe to kind of do that but this just being a small little free handout i'm just going to kind of make it i want to pull it a little bit you can kind of see here as i pulled a little bit it's gonna trap those air bubbles and it's gonna reflect some light and as you can already tell it's a little bit lighter than it was see that there so once i get it to about exactly where i want it which this is probably pretty good we're going to take it over to our cooling table or to our heating table i'm sorry so let's head on over there this is our little setup here for our heating table let me set this up for you guys so i've already got two pans set up for when i cut there we go for when i'm cutting it to get it just right for you guys there so you can get a good idea of what i'm doing let me see if i add some light there if that helps let me know if that helps this being my first video i'm kind of testing some of the uh lighting and different things that i'm using so um what i have here is just a oversized griddle with some silpats on it to get it nice and i don't need it hot because the candy will melt so what i'm doing is just keeping it from completely cooling down and getting too hard so that i can still manipulate it pull it and cut it i like to use ten and a half inch scissors so i like to make kind of this little design like this and what that does is it kind of keeps it hotter up here because it is um a little bit thicker but as i pull it i pull it from this end and i get the consistency that i want coming out of that so as you can see it's still a little bit too soft because if i tried to pull this right now it would just kind of really thin out [Music] and i'll show you what it does when that happens i'll pull from the other side and this is just kind of a test run on the consistency so i'm not too worried about it you could actually put this back into the candy if you wanted to and what this does is the way that i cut them it makes these nice little pillows nice little bite-sized pillows and just from doing it for for as long as i have and as many times as i have i kind of have an idea of the consistency that i want as far as the size and thickness of the candy and the reason i have two pans is that i still pull it when it's a little bit hot and so if you do them all together they can stick together um obviously once they cool down you just drop them in there but for me it's just easier and like i said you'll get these nice little pillows when you're done i call them little candy pillows um it's just from pinching each side with the scissors and it's kind of uh really gives it that homemade look and feel to it um you know that people really know that i've done all this by hand people are kind of surprised sometimes when i say that i've cut and make each each piece by hand instead of at a machine and i'm not worried about having every piece exactly the same size i mean i like to have a good consistency and i think you know those look great um sometimes i do get a bigger piece or a smaller piece but i do it by weight when i when i do them so that uh uh you're gonna get the same amount of candy every time there might be a couple bigger or smaller pieces but um that's you know you'll get the same amount every time then i just keep flipping it making sure i get the same amount same consistency pulled off every time make nice little so just starting out this channel you guys let me know comment down below let me know what colors you'd like to see what flavors um any questions you might have i can also make i will be doing some videos that are multi-colored to kind of show you how to uh put more than one one color together and how i build them and and get it a nice looking piece of candy so i will be doing a couple videos on that and obviously if you guys would like to try any of this candy um you can go to my website at sweetfreakscandy.com and check out any of our i think right now i've got about 36 flavors in stock you can check them out have them shipped to you and if you see any flavors that you like on any of these videos let me know and we'll be doing a discount code the discount code will be uh youtube and if you put that in it will give you 20 off of your order so that's another reason to uh watch it so on these um on this heating unit this griddle i never really go past warmth because then that will get it too hot to where the candy will start to melt but as i go and it gets smaller and smaller it gets a little bit harder so i turn it up just a bit to keep it going i'm going to start doing a little bit longer pieces [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and that's all there is to it guys so like i said if you'd like to check out any of this candy go to sweetfreakscandy.com comment down below let me know what uh you guys want to see if you guys like the video it is my first one doing it this way so i'll figure out the lighting and kind of the angles and everything to make sure that it's okay but for now that's what we have to work with and there's your finished product pretty cool so if you guys have any questions comment down below please like subscribe appreciate all the uh love and support that we could get on this channel it's brand new so like i said i will be putting in a

going snake them back again with another video from vapor abuse and today our video is gonna be reviewing the top eat juices of the month now we're gonna be doing this [ __ ] me in the [ __ ] I love cheese's and now this will be a monthly video introducing five new juices that we have that are going to be on second why babe calm as well as customers feedback if they're top-5 salt Nick's so let's get started alright so topping out at number one of my personal favorite juices is going to be the nasty slow blow nasty slow blow is going to be a pineapple lime soda as well as with a hint of menthol now NASA's been one of my favorite brands from eliquid to when salt became popular and it turned into salt Nick I actually have the nasty slow blow in my Orien and this is probably the best combination the Orion has the perfect amount of flavor and the adjustable airflow to match with this amazing juice so taking a few hits off these off this device to just tell y'all personal feedback on the juice so with this juice it is a menthol based juice and you don't really get a lot of it with the nasty since it is considered a low mint juice but that is still it's a pineapple soda and I do taste that the pineapple I don't really taste the lime in this juice but the pineapple is the better flavor so this juice to me is gonna be number one on my list with all of the features features so coming in at number two I'm gonna have this aqua mist this Alchemist is gonna be a green apple peach in Kiwi this is personally one of my favorite aqua juices I do use aqua a lot I did a video on the zero when I did my video on the zero I used aqua mist to tell you how I thought about it so what I look for in an e juice is the fact that what their flavor description says so aqua said that aqua mist is going to be a green apple peach and kiwi and to me all three flavors were there it was 100% correct each flavor was brought out in the vapor production as well as the taste the green apple the peach and the Kiwi was all there and the flavor was amazing my juice coming in at number three is actually a customer preference and all their feedback telling me on how great this juice is and this is going to be naked 100 lava flow this is gonna be a strawberry pineapple coconut so kind of like a strawberry pi\u00f1a colada I'm personally not a big fan on coconut flavored juices but I have tried this a couple of times and when I did the flavor was really on point they did a good job mixing it it is a 50/50 VG PG which is in my opinion one of the best salt licks you can get the main focus on this was the strawberry and to me the strawberry is way more powerful than the coconut and the pineapple which in my opinion is a plus I've personally heard that a lot of people like this juice just because they want a pi\u00f1a colada juice and there isn't really another juice mates making this video I also realized this is our last one in store this juice is so popular that we can't even keep it in the store often we usually sell about 10 to 15 bottles of this a day which is the most popular in all three of our stores online second white vape we you're always sold out of this and we have to wait for our new shipment to come in so try this wallets in stock that's big what there's no plant called there's no yeah but I think the Jolly Ranchers are blue raspberry that's based on one I don't know it's like a blueberry that's got a raspberry we're out here boggling minds I know so coming in at number four is gonna be the air factory blue razz this air factory blue razz reminds me of a Jolly Rancher that is the blue raspberry flavored and to me that is my favorite color Jolly Rancher I don't know about y'all you can comment your favorite Jolly Rancher down in the comment section but this is my favorite hard candy flavored juice this is more of the sweeter one flavored juice not the multi mixed fruits so to me this is an original flavor and the flavor is really brought out in certain devices like the soaring air the flavor is really strong in it the readout which I do have is the flavor is really strong in this with this juice so if hard candy is your cup of tea then go ahead and give air factory blue razz a shot you will not be disappointed I promise I guarantee it last but not least we have the mr. salty cotton candy mr. salty cotton candy is actually our number two seller on our website secondlife.com it is the most popular eliquid you can find this in a twenty-five and a forty-five milligram nicotine which a lot of you do like as a pro the lower the nicotine sometimes you don't want 50 sometimes you want 25 sometimes you want 35 which is very hard to come by but mr. salty is one of those brands that does do that so that in my opinion is a very big plus but cotton candy takes me back it tastes like the circus cotton candy that I used to go when I was five years old and go get cotton candy with my mom and dad at the circus it's got the blue raspberry taste as long with a strawberry taste so to me that's kind of my favorite fruits mine I know blue-raspberry isn't a fruit but I do like the candies that are blue razz so to me blue raspberry and strawberry two of my top favorite flavors so this to me is one of my favorite juices as well as our most popular on our website so that was my top five favorite juices of 2018 and I'm very excited to see what 2019 has to bring for us so thank you very much for watching our video please like and subscribe leave a comment down in the comment section of what you want to see next or comment your favorite eliquid and I will go ahead and try it out if I already haven't thank you very much for watching we're out [Music]", "y61THGbv5Lw": "BREAKING NEWS OUT OF HINDS COUNTY.

"hi Scott hey guys today we're going to review a little foxes glacier licorice good stuff really good stuff delicious tasty has a real nice juicy flavor that comes through a little sticky I had this one for a while I've been waiting to do this review very sticky it's great i mean the flavor here is fantastic right now it has good gooey outer coating but it gets to a very very hard candy it's not like an like a normal licorice is this this deep anise flavor is nice tasty not too salty not to sourish licorice flavor but has like a berry not a fruity berry but just this like this maybe it isn't fruity better Barry but this flavor that comes through at the end that is just it is outright delightful it's just delicious there is a big big problem with this candy I mean I want to stress it again this candy is great tasting I love this now at this point I could say something like I could eat this all day but the fact of the matter is is if you suck on it you have to eat it all day it lasts forever and it's just a little too big I'm going to be slightly disgusting right now it hasn't changed it's the second sighs and it's too big to sit in your mouth was talking with Johnny about it and we're talking about jolly rancher which we really like and jolly ranchers a flit a candy that's kind of the same size it kind of last as long but you can keep it in your mouth it's a fruity tangy flavor this is still licorice I can literally I think it would take me about a half an hour to suck through one of these and it's just too long it's so long that it actually makes this a candy that I haven't eaten too much had about three of these is probably my fourth and again I will go back it is delicious it is a great taste in candy it just takes way way way too long to get through it this point you figured it was shrink I don't feel like it's gained mass in my mouth it's been tough for me it's been tough to enjoy this candy in your playroom that's their train table I will give this a wow I almost want to give it two different two different our ratings so i would give it a nine or a ten even almost for flavor it is really great but i am not eating these candies and that is are indicative of candy I don't like so I i have to say kind of don't like this candy I'm gonna give it a six all around because it just takes too long to get through it but definitely go out and try and another thing thing that I really think that uh the people of our foxes could not could do if you guys meet this candy in a little Tim much smaller like little wafers I need these all day long but item separately I'd take a little break can't take a break with this one ten about that big at high 30 of them in there do it Scotty Candy Girls be good eat that candy you", "g0M5bXC1wsM": "hey guys

[ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely

chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are

okay so you bought some strong snus yes last time we did a video about a snooze cold bolt yeah and we got a lot of requests our followers who wanted us to test something stronger people wrote Siberia off-road thunder so they just you know yeah let's shoot that out yeah rap tried it here it goes I don't know if these news are available in your country if it is good for you it's not well for reference scale wise on how strong these are yeah Swedish match general has dinner voice yeah regular snows has 0.8 yeah and if it's an extra strong for example this one it's 1.8 okay and then there's the super strong which we tested the vault vault which is 2.6 yeah and that was thrown and then we have these extreme yeah they are in a different category so these are up to 4.5 my almost 5 times stronger than the regular snare yet and I'm already getting sweaty yeah so which one do we try it first I thought we should test the least strongest one yeah so there's a scale so yeah that's this is diggity now I bought I bought a lot of it so I guess I have to snooze this now so this is gonna be my regular snooze for what I don't know months ahead you know like a week a week ahead this is not good no ok so this is the least strong yes so this is called glove explosion white yep it's like a bomb explosion explosion explosion explosion explosion now I said it four times it was like a bone exploding it's a bomb exploding on the on the cover yeah it's almost it smells like whoa gingerbread oh yeah that's not good smell I got this okay so first one yeah 3.5 3.5 okay I'm starting to feel the burn it is strong yeah it is strong yeah it's definitely yeah it's you know my head is gonna warm I think it's pretty good yeah it's not bad snow definitely not about this and this smell I'm China starting to like it what is that yeah I would say it smells like torque and I think it smells like Christmas I guess we have different prisons as you and me tartar bread with our hand okay yeah it's a strong snus kind of kind of good oh it's okay okay next one is actually Siberia the strongest one is four point five and this is four point three is very little difference no that was three point five this is four point three yep it's a bit minty actually yeah yeah I can hear big old strong snooze here we go - eighty degrees Celsius on this one I don't know what that means but yeah I do know Oh because of the minty yep it feels like my upper lip is very cold right now yes the whole body is inside but my upper lip just went to you like Siberia yeah exactly and had a snooze really strong one and then came back in like holy freaking yes this is strong yeah and I got this much of this set up and I at home reference whoo I'm getting I guess this is weird feeling my body's like burning up but this limb smell is in Siberia I'm getting a bit of a hi-yah as focus wise you know it's like I got a think you know okay so now I'm looking there no no I'm looking over there and like aware of it you know I'm only I'm aware of this I'm just real hot cop contingent feeling on my on my upper lip and to refocus they're like dude you're not in focus the hell my eyes know it is wrong do again but I do not like the toothpaste II taste okay my safety because of the solution yeah you look shaky holy [ __ ] you're shaking how much can't even see I can't even look at my own hand yeah yeah strong so okay let's move on all these three are the same strength yep 4.5 watch right portion Thunder eggs it smells like a zoo [Laughter] whoa like a farm animal combined with mint yeah this one burns it's only Birds nothing else nothing else taste no smell get burned holy crap story I stopped thinking I was like reading and then not reading and then I was like think reading it backwards I was turning it this way I actually feel a bit lightheaded yeah I'm stupid like no I'll do it the other way around I don't really like this one no it's too strong too strong and and I think the pouch is too too flat but if you like strong snus it's it's good sness switch it okay so this is called arctic explorer or Froude X also 4.5 mm it's almost empty yeah this is mint not as much as the Siberia the instant burn this is wrong yes very strong now I understand what you mean that we have to focus some things yeah right no no cause I made this oh I'm holding it now we have to turn it ya have to think what I'm doing yeah exactly you gotta be very experienced to do this apparently we aren't nope but I guess it's good if you don't want to do like herring herring or crow yeah go over this and said it's cheaper and legal yep I'm like dozed off yeah me too I'm feeling hi yeah like after after smoking a blunt yeah I've never done it no of course we haven't but if you man oh yeah seeing people smoking

one is pink not purple love me a mango she has a stronger smell than anybody else how do one I have the lamest smell at the least male the least smell is this one I can really smell the cotton candy you only smell them a little bit but this wasn't really still like hope their scent I really loved that and yeah and then of course we got our stamp it get in there okay so this is the stamp and this is the thing here to stamp it it's a little bit squishy now butter it's not sticky it feels like a little rubbery and solid thing there and we got the lid here and then they show you what this my mom's thing what the ship is gonna be it's also said that it sounds like melon and this is it smells this one's even stronger than this one so I should we do want to have a lamest not because it's imposing whereas plastic rubber and plastic but this I still have the labels now that's really weird and where's how to step in here tail and the tail was a little too squishy and feels like gummy you guys should totally feel this if you have these let's see what this one this this one the bottom of the NAM I mean not this one didn't fit the nominee they're not gonna fit on the coordinate candy her name hardly candy right um this is me I mingle but I believe they don't feel this looks like a little harder than our usual then the usual numbness this feels a little bit softer and squishier show you my Gabby gray yeah burger grab room Gabby grape has the most softest and squish here squishiest and let's see if this thing does mom do actually fit do me a mango oops [Music] fit in there I think so and it does fit so if something is soft like this they don't fit the coordinate candy because Courtney candy is like one heart nom nom and let's see if it fits Gabby gray this one she the norm should fit the Gabby gray was it really hard no it should fit but I guess I guess my hands not working yet yep it does but because you don't know pulling gosh it's a little tricky to put it on but it should fit yep I think it did it did fit closer look up Gabby great Courtney candy Luke's just um just her tongue sticking out plus let's see if I can you smile camera to make it just make if you can see the tossing some time I came out don't really you so very sorry about that in this meow mango because I'm using soon I don't use camera she looks really gorgeous there and then let's see if you can stack them I just wanted just want to see and in the guy be grape here I was going to start corny candy see if I can suck them I think I did wait I'm gonna put her [Music] very cool okay so now I'm just going to tidy my set I really love the packaging it just looks really cool and I feels like I just feel a little bad I just throw them so I'm just going to cheat them for the rest of my life alone now okay so this is my number you saw the box looks really cool and I feel like I want to eat them I love candies but I'm allergic to marshmallows so I don't think that I would really want to buy these okay so if you're gonna store you have these small these this one as you can see that back pulls there here right here hope I can focus me there there's a holder that you can post on it

"mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "8C8ogmlkfV0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop
