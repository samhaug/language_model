California founded in 2007 with their core values being very simple delivering the highest quality and consistency through a brand name you can rely on all of their products are pure organic unadulterated and a hundred percent solvent free you would like to know more you'll find a link to their website down below now let's open it up and see if it's worth a dad let's start with the packaging right away the front gives you a good idea of what to expect on the back you'll find the general warnings on the top you'll find a sticker that tells you the strain and other information such as THC and CBD to open it up you squeeze the two sides and push down then slide the inside package out to find your pure syringe before using them make sure to twist off and pull the cap at the bottom then just push down to enjoy your pure syringe now I've seen enough let's dab some of this beautiful oil dabbing this on the quartz gives it a really good strawberry flavor I say it tastes like strawberry phantom though I have had others say it's like a strawberry Jolly Rancher it burns really nice on the nail and almost instantly gives me a pure head hi I would suggest this for an activity you want to focus on but you still want to just crack up it had me feeling really good and really uplifted is it worth the dabber is it a pass I'm gonna say it's a definite dab everyone the taste is so good and reminds me of a candy strawberry flavor the syringe makes it perfect to moderate your dabs if you find a pure syringe at your cannabis club be sure to grab one thank you for watching the

session this time we're going to be toking it down with the black tuna that's right the infamous black tuna by the black tuna gang baby that's right so stay tuned [Music] hey brothers and sisters welcome back to cosmic's food i am maximilian screedl your host and i am going to bring you on a journey today an inspired journey to check out a strain called black tuna that's right the mysterious black tuna strain that's been circling around south florida the past few months actually it's been here a whole lot longer than that but check this [ __ ] out man this stuff is coming in at over 27 dude i'm not even messing around man 27.73 percent for this half gram doobie that i picked up here at the del ray beach true leaf i might add it says on here it's by the black tuna gang but i believe it's by five star organics out of british columbia actually who makes the strain um or who actually came up with this strain um the story behind it is this it's actually named after the infamous black tuna gang uh they were smugglers robert plattshorn and his buddy robert uh i think his name was meinster these two dudes mastermind the smuggling in uh tons and tons of santa marta gold which was the colombian gold uh marijuana strain that basically uh was discovered uh down here brought up to gainesville um uh mixed with some dutch hawaiian or some sorry some maui and that created gainesville green so this all ties in man there's all there's all little tidbits of history and knowledge throughout this uh throughout this show man which makes it so cosmic brother you know what i'm saying i mean i'm just feeling the vibes electricity man right now just talking about the strain i'm getting so stoked anyway dude these guys didn't get busted bringing the weed in this this was like huge [ __ ] the dea i'm gonna put a link to the uh this guy's got like a documentary out about him uh robert plattsborn the black tuna gang they were actually they didn't call themselves the black tuna gang they were actually dubbed that by the dea uh because they were allegedly they had they had these gold medallions they would wear that uh they had a black uh tuna and bl uh emblazed on them were uh emblems on the front of the [ __ ] thing or some [ __ ] but they didn't get caught till afterwards man i guess there was some kind of weird like insurance thing or something one dude used car dealership it's always a used car dealership right in south florida it gets something on the chase man anyway they get busted this guy gets 64 years man um he got out a couple decades back and he's been an advocate for medical marijuana understand some legalization of marijuana throughout florida and the united states in general um i'm going to toss a bunch of links up here for this dude man robert plattshorn i actually heard he spoke locally here in del rey once about a year ago but this is that strain right here this is the infamous black tuna half gram pre-roll couple of dry tokes on that wow you can really like that's got a really one of a kind like flavor i can't like hold on you just gotta take these out you want to get the best load just do it yeah this is probably gonna [ __ ] me up because this shit's not for beginners as soon as i heard that man with this high thc percentage i was like i gotta get down on this now this is a cross between um lambs bread and harijuana so i'm too pretty killer strange it's known as a i believe what i read it was a 50 50 hybrid and uh don't want to burn my luscious locks here on this like succulent dude i heard it was a 50 50 hybrid i'm not really sure a lot of people have a lot to say about that but whatever man we're just here just vibing on the experience man yeah dude so there's a lot of his like by the name of this weed man this like the company that actually started making it five star organics used to uh apparently from what i heard days to package this like eights in like tunic tin cans for you for sale this has got an amazing taste very earthy sweetness very herbal [Music] oh thick clean smoke the ash on that's burning real white so you know this stuff was the stuff was growing real well man because when you got that it's a clean flush that means they took good care of this plant man when you take good care of that you know take good care of your plants and take good care of you oh my goodness dude shaka narnar dude i can feel that right here in my nugget oh he blew a fuse like spreading out just dripping down my spinal cord like tingling ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding don eats like

chirpy Tom coming back at you with something quick another different one today I'm not gonna be doing review won't be telling you give me some information about some reclaim if you are under 18 and you are a kid get the [ __ ] step in this is not the channel for you it's just for adults in MCC patients are like I will repeat that again if you are a child in under 18 and is not say MCC patients then [ __ ] kick rocks [ __ ] off all right so I'm tell you guys a little something about some reclaim okay reclaim is the stuff that when you smoke oil and concentrate it's the stuff that gathers up and your reclaim catchers and in the bottom of your bongs you know like like this I got to reclaim cuts are there it's basically the resident from your oil that you smoke right but that said there's a couple of different things that you can do with your reclaim you can cook with your reclaim you can put your reclaiming capsules and swallow it like like a pill you can put it in and put it in and uh like some like lotions and type of stuff you know what I mean I'm pretty sure you can do that I know my buddy makes capsules with them like he does something and puts them in capsules and something butter and all this type of but you can cook well there's all different types of stuff you do what I normally do it I either ain't normally smoke it out of a rig or be put it in brownies I put some stuff in brownies before it was actually probably about around this much probably about two grams maybe a little over two grams of reclaimed but yeah I put it in some brownies and I made some reclaimed brownies and it pretty [ __ ] nice to be honest with you guys but yeah I mean like reclaim you know here's the Greek line walk give your example of how to get the reclaim out so you guys can see reclaim their right all right see reclaim their so basically you just heat it heat it up a little bit right you don't want to eat that too hot alright and it will start to drip you guys can see it I don't think I got it up too hot too hot there let me try to get this up camera here for you guys it goes drip drip drip alright says they get you reclaim out I do know the code temps whenever you're dab and the the colder attempt the better reclaim you're going to get the more active THC the active Tait sees not burnt fully away like it would be with the hot tempt app if that makes sense the hot scent - the lower THC potent abs the higher THC right because you're not burning it all off so I smoked my mic reclaimed two different ways I smoked it out of this [ __ ] this nail here alright this titanium nail I normally don't do it with the advice nail quartz now but I am going to try to do it today on this video for you guys so yes I'm gonna be smoking off this run and then trying to smooth off this one so that said I am just about out of oil yeah so that's why I am making this video on reclaim to get to my drugs just get home off work figure make you guys a little video I got one Sunday so [Music] yes so I got I I still got some oil left I'm not gonna lie but I got a little bit of the strawberry banana pie MPX I got a little bit of X I got a good bit of the the Grande purple afterburner I have no more oh I got a tiny tiny little bit left of the Crisco tangerine all right at I mean a tiny little bit left yeah and then I get a little bit of my [ __ ] my favorite cute cush left right here right so I got that and that's it so like yeah I got a I get to get some money together and go get some oil guys right anyway let's get into this real quick all right so you eat your nail up just like you would any other nail right no I have not used this Rick and Morty bond since like basically since I've got it okay my buddy wants it I'm probably gonna end up send to my buddy drivers have you ever watched this video this bone is yours if you want to buy it unless homeboy said he was gonna give me a little bit more money for and then I would sell it to him but Wayne talks [ __ ] walks right boys wait anyway you eat this bad boy up like you do your you do your normal traditional nail right and yeah you put it on now I have no carb cat to this guy to this nail here so basically I just use like a empty empty jar will concentrate was and before right don't get hot second get tool alright guys this stuff is it looks beautiful I'm not gonna lie oh the music is slightly stupid if you're wondering alright so there we go you guys ready yeah I do not I'm not [ __ ] with this box I'm not burning my [ __ ] up nope nope not this guy I'm not [ __ ] stupid Oh seen that like yep not doing that Cheers take us out of ya see I'm still learning my damn self I I don't ever use his nail so yeah this is this is gonna be [ __ ] fun here I have no idea what's gonna happen I'm probably [ __ ] out Worley but alright [Music] it's a smoker boys nice one and you know what guys to reclaim it doesn't taste bad and I tell you why it doesn't taste bad because I do 90% of my dabs that cold start yes you guys heard me at cold start you heard it right that's why my reap I'm don't taste like [ __ ] 90% I'm not too bad with this this metal nail here this titanium nail I said it don't taste bad either yeah it looks dark as [ __ ] not too too bad though right wow I'm going to try it in this nail and then like I said I'm trying to do this video quick is it's not a review it's just me teaching you guys a little something you can do with your reclaim right so let's recap right so you can dab your reclaim you can cook really reclaim you can bake caps with your reclined I'm pretty sure you can like make lotions and stuff with your reclaiming yeah I mean it's pretty cool right until you get to get high from your recent recycled [ __ ] I concentrate that's super dope and like I said mine don't taste like [ __ ] so and if the potency is really high to guys like really high on on the [ __ ] reclaim to so like I actually feel off of that a few hits week there I got I feel nice buzz a nice buzz going on I'm gonna get this guy a little hot I don't want no fail like last time I dunno if you get these things really hot and you put in a nice chunk I believe it's with any condensate really concentrate we're starting to bow oh it can't fly out of your banger and land on you and burn the [ __ ] out of you I've seen it on the youtubes dab fails you guys ever seen the dive fail YouTube John this is pretty [ __ ] funny [ __ ] ain't gonna lie alright I believe that's hot enough boys [ __ ] yeah yeah I just keep on getting it done I boys gonna be ass [ __ ] call Barry boys yes we're gonna bet going huh I'm Ariane this moment yeah ready here we go damn that actually tastes pretty damn good I'm not gonna lie to you it tastes pretty good I'm actually really really [ __ ] are happy with the way to taste man like Jesus here he goes not too bad free climbed a beery climb y'all go give it a chance this is literally like my second and third time smoking reclaims I never have to I never have to start tastes like [ __ ] now yeah so there you go guys don't don't throw it away definitely don't throw it away cook with it eat it [ __ ] putting caps when we shove it up your [ __ ] sure no I don't do that but y'all know what I'm saying just yeah that's good I got a nice nice buzz going on nice little dabs that going on yeah so there's a few things you can do with your reclaim like I said smoke it capsule it up cook with it you know really whatever you want to do so there you go guys there's it a little quick pass one for you under 15 minutes what do you know y'all know what it is it's your boy turpentine signing off this [ __ ] life subscribe all that [ __ ] stay medicated boys peace tape timeout this yep", "-8kPucbOdT8": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're at our partnered manufacturing facility outside of Dayton Ohio looking at our all new line of KPD series of industrial extractors [Music] precision first conceptualized the KPD series of extractors about two years ago when we saw the shift towards a large scale processing both in cannabis and hemp what we did at the time is we searched for the best most well qualified manufacturing partner that we could build an industrial scale modular extraction platform with we found AMG engineering in Dayton Ohio and they've been a pleasure to work with ever since we've combined our expertise in the cannabis and hemp manufacturing arena with their expertise in the AG reprocessing and Industrial Engineering competency and what that's allowed us to do is build a massive but easy to use modular processing center that can be dropped on the farm can be dropped into a building and it's very easy turnkey ready to operate so a lot of people ask why build a modular self-contained industrial extraction skid and the reasons are numerous the first one is that this whole apparatus that you see here takes four people to operate the second thing is it's extremely simple right it's plug-and-play you drop it and you can drop it onto a slab in a farm you can drop it into an industrial processing building or any number of easy turnkey solutions the flip side of this is people typically have unreasonable expectations when it comes to batch processing batch processing is extremely laborious and if you think about having seven or eight or nine extractors to be able to equal the throughput that something like this does you're talking about running those batch extractors 24 hours a day you're talking about having three shifts of people and you may well employ 40 50 60 employees in order to do the same work that four employees could do with a plant such as this so it's really oughta mating the process its streamlining your efficiencies and it's allowing you to operate a business with an extremely low overhead and as we all know that the price of commodities of THC and CBD eventually are declining it's very important to be able to operate your business with very low operational overhead costs to be able to make margin continually as these large players come in and put competitive pressures on the market so we've designed all this in mind when you look at the design of this extraction plant not only does it have the modularity but we'll talk about some of the efficiencies that this plant does as you can see behind me one of the components we have reflux stills so that your reap roofing your ethanol so you're not having ethanol loss we have a number of different high efficiency methods to take the ethanol back out of the biomass and any a number of these small problems that you run into a batch processing all these losses add up and we've designed this with our processing expertise and AMG's industrial manufacturing expertise to be the most efficient most effective way to extract and that's what you see here today [Applause] so now that you understand a bit about the concept of the KPD series of extractors why we built it how we built it how we conceptualized it let's take a look at some of the more technical components on how it operates and why it's so efficient so the first thing that we're gonna look at is our contacts motor control center and basically what this is it's the brain of the entire operation so what's gonna happen is this skid will be placed on a slab somewhere in a warehouse but your motor control center and your plant control center will be separate the reason that that's designed like that is to keep all the components that could come in contact with any solvent that are flammable it keeps the the risk level down basically so that those flammable vapors aren't coming in contact with any of your motor controls so let's take a look inside the control center so inside what you're going to see is you're going to see all your variable frequency drives you're gonna see all of your motor controls and ultimately this is all linked through one interface right so it's all computer-controlled everything on this entire plant you can see all your temperatures all your motor speeds all your input your output your discharge every single function within that plant is controlled from this brain so you can see on your wall all of your shut offs all of your VFDs all of your control panels all of your power input everything is controlled from this room so remembering our HMI interface and our computer brain interface from our con X you also have a display and a touch screen interface on the actual plant so not only can your controllers see what's going on from your control room your operators can see what's going on in the plant from your HMI interface on your actual machine so the process all starts here and basically what this is is you're gonna have your conveyor feeding in your biomass and this is the first step of the process this is a cooling screw conveyor so what will happen is you take your warm biomass and you cool down your biomass in order for when it hits the solvent it's not warming up the solvent obviously you're putting a massive amount of biomass into this extraction plant you're putting a massive amount of solvent so you can understand that the heat energy if the biomass is not properly cooled is going to raise the temperature of the solvent and therefore that affect the extraction efficiency and the extraction quality so what we do is passing it through here this is jacketed and it's controlled to about negative 40 degrees centigrade in order to cool the biomass and take some of that heat energy away to have a nice efficient consistent extraction so the next step in the process once the biomass is cooled you can see that it drops into this first extraction tank and basically what this is is a counter current ethanol extraction so you've got ethanol coming in from one side you've got your biomass coming in from the other if you have a set retention time they mix the solvent strips that cannabinoids from the plant and ultimately you have your micelle a stream coming out so biomass into your first tank solvent into your third tank and through the entire process they mix through the tanks until they're ultimately separated you will have your cannabinoids and solvent go to one area and you'll have your biomass go to another area so let's follow the stream of the cannabinoids through to the next step once your extraction process is started you're gonna have your micellar stream which we call my salad your cannabinoid and solvent mixture in your micelle a holding tank right here this folding tank is constantly going to be processed through your finds filtration which is going to take out most of your fine particulates that might clog your evaporator any residual waxes and we actually do that with not only the Candela filters and the michela but we use a pre-code as well so this precoat tank will have any number of three coats it could be diatomaceous earth it could be any number of absorbance or things like that that will actually pre coat your filtration and allow for a more pure more efficient extraction so let's take a look at how this all works you have your micellar coming here you have your pre coat tank coming here both of these streams are mixed and they're pushed upwards into our filtration mechanisms which are up here so let's have a look at those so once that micelle a stream is coming up here it's being pushed into our filters and these are three candle filters that basically are filtered with precoat coating the filter membrane and then we have our micellar coming right behind that and basically that's creating a filtration mechanism that's taking out all those impurities highly refining your masala stream ultimately your filters will become caked when they become caked after a number of hours could be a day could be three days could be you know 12 hours it really depends on the consistency of your biomass and how you're extracting what you're going to do is do a blowdown on your filters so these filters are extremely easy to clean as you can see the graded bottoms what you're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bucket or some sort of a bag discharge bag you're gonna wrap it around here and you're gonna do a blowdown to blow down the filter and all your discharge cake is gonna come out again same thing you have redundancy so if you're discharging one filter that the other filter is still in use so that you're never losing your continuous process so that takes us through our filtration step what we're gonna do once we have that micellar filtered and we have it clean we're gonna move on to evaporation and evaporation is the process of actually separating that solvent from the original cannabinoids that we have so it's no longer going to be a micelle a stream at this point we're gonna have crude oil and we're going to have solvent so the next step in our process is evaporation and as we stated evaporation is taking that micellar stream of your cannabinoids and your solvent and separating it so we're gonna take our micelle and separate it into two streams ones are going to become crude oil one's going to become our purified ethanol and that's done with this section of the plant right here what you're seeing is you're seeing two giant distillation towers so you can see they started all the way up here and they go all the way down to the second floor beneath my feet about 20 feet tall and what that's actually doing is applying heat to the solvent in order for the solvent to vaporize once the solvents vaporizing it's coming it's separating from the heavier cannabinoid mixture and as the solvent vaporizes it reconned ences on a separate condenser column behind me which creates a liquefied solvent that's been purified and that leaves us with our micelle a stream that's been purified into the purified solvent of course and then our purified cannabinoids which we refer to as crude oil so let's take a look at the next step in the process which is one that's very crucial and often overlooked so once we have our solvent purified from our micellar stream it's very very important that we do a reflux distillation on that solvent and here's the reason why ethanol is what's called a homogeneous azeotrope with water as you know we're extracting a plant there's a lot of water in the plant when it comes out of the field we dry most of that water out through our drying process but you may have anywhere between 2 to 10 percent water and your residual biomass now what's gonna happen because ethanol is a homogenious azeotrope with water those two molecules are just going to want to stay right together the boiling points are so close that they can't be separated with the traditional evaporation why this is relevant is because over time your solvent becomes diluted and becomes less effective at extracting your cannabinoids so you can imagine that you start with 190-proof pure solvent and over time it's going to be diluted with water once you hit around 170 proof or a little bit lower than that your extraction efficiency becomes greatly compromised which is the reason that we have reflux stills so reflux stills are a different type of evaporation they're used with a very tall tower without with a packing material in them and what that does is it allows that very close boiling point to separate from the water and the solvent so we've integrated this into our plant so it's a turnkey system solvent never needs to be replaced in this plant because the efficiency is so high in terms of not only the reclaim rate from your biomass and your evaporation but also the reap roofing of the solvent it's a completely closed system which makes it extremely efficient and extremely easy to before when we were talking about operating your business on really good margins and maintaining efficiency and how you operate your extraction process this is one of the central key components to do that for for your ROI for your business now that we've walked through the evaporation process and the purification of the solvent we need to follow our crude oil through the other output stream so what happens with the crude oil once it comes out of our evaporator as it moves into these holding tanks and basically what these holding tanks are doing is holding the oil and heating it to perform the decarboxylation process D carb is a very very common process that's used in preparation of your crude oil for not only consumption but for final distillation that's what these tanks do right here and ultimately these tanks can be routed and pumped to a distillation machine or any types of popes post-processing that you would like to use so now that we've followed our micellar stream through the entire plant through refinement all the way to D carb and through re proofing of the solvent the other side of the aspect of the processing of this plant is the actual biomass that's coming out so we have a lot of spent biomass that's coming out of this plant and once it comes out of those extraction tanks that we looked at earlier it's ultimately pumped as a slurry up into these separators so we have these rotary strainer separators and basically what they do is they separate that pulpy sludge of biomass it's the first pass that takes the solvent off and what that's doing is it's taking kind of that like I said pulpy sort of really wet biomass and separating the ethanol from it in order for the biomass to then drop into a heated mechanism which is where you're going to regain the remainder of your solvent out of the biomass so let's take a look at that next the last and one of the most crucial processes in our plant is the reclamation of the final solvent from that biomass so as we saw before we separated the majority of the solvent from the biomass using our strainers but it's still think about you know wringing out a sponge you get most of the of the of the moisture out of the sponge by using that pressure but in order to get the remainder of the moisture out of the sponge or in this case our biomass acting like a sponge we need to heat it and that's precisely what this heated screw does here so you can see it's quite lengthy there's a lot of heat energy that goes into that but the flip side is we're taking a typical 94 93 95 percent efficiency and we're taking that efficiency up above 99 percent in terms of reclamation of your solvent now the reason that's important is because obviously we're on industrial scale here we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of processing per day you can imagine there's quite a bit of solvent that's being used there so when you're losing 5% of that massive amount of solvent you can imagine what the cost is last we checked Evan all's you know 32 dollars a gallon for for azeotropic ethanol around seven dollars a litre depending on your region if you're losing 5% of everything you're processing with which is the case with typical plants typical batch installations batch installations could be even higher than that you can imagine how that's going to affect your effects and how that's going to affect your ROI especially as you have margin compression on your commodity one of the reasons that we designed this in is exactly that so you may have been wondering what are these giant for tanks on the end of this skid and it's very important because these are our CIP tanks CIP stands for clean in place clean in place is a protocol that's used throughout manufacturing throughout GMP throughout any type of protocol that requires food grade or pharma grade compliance now these CIP tanks are meant to hold an acid wash a base wash and then you have a reuse tank so basically what we're doing is we're imagining any sort of contamination that can get into this system based upon what that contamination is you may need an acid rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you may need a base rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you made into ethanol rinse in order to dissolve that contamination which is basically what we have in this entire plant so again through the HMI interface through the control center you have a completely automated CIP process in order to clean this plant the reason that that's extremely relevant is has more regulations and more restrictions come into the cannabis and hemp space you're going to be subject to testing for pesticides for mold for mildews and you can imagine that if any of that stuff's on your biomass and gets into your plant that you're automatically going to potentially contaminate your plant with a contamination source from the field one of the prime examples that we could use is micro butanol in California it's virtually everywhere and in order to remediate micro butanol audit your processing equipment there's a variety of processes that are needed to do that right now in batch equipment everybody does that manual and it's very laborious and time-consuming but as GMP restrictions and regulations come into play you're going to need to have a set standardized process that can be replicated and duplicated in order to be accurate every single time that's exactly what this CI piece kit does and that's exactly what our control center an automation skid does thanks for watching our overview on our KP d series of industrial extraction plants these plants can be engineered to process anywhere from ten thousand pounds a day up to several hundred thousand over a million if that's what you want our engineering partners as well as ourselves with our engineering expertise and our product expertise know every step of the process we know how to make it the most efficient and that's exactly what we've done here and what we've seen today we look forward to working with you and please give us a call if you have any questions you", "FhVW8b0VWkc": "oh yeah that's a whole lot better lose the keyboard get a life man far [ __ ] out all right so you're torching cleaning up my desk and we're alive out here right ain't that right i know we're live cause there's z puffs what what's up jerry we're live right that's cool because uh there's uh there's z puffs and andrew and laura zero hell yeah so i figured we were we're running gamer thomas stuntman ricardo they're all rolling in slow i like that single mall sloth i like that what's it blake purple tofu of course tofu what purple tofu is in there you like tofu yeah he likes purple taupes purple tofu is that what that's what i see on my screen that's exotic right pretty cool i just had some uh for dinner last night uh was it last night yeah uh purple cauliflower yummy oh yeah i've had purple cauliflower before i've never seen it that was pretty cool i had orange and purple purple orange is next nice it tastes any different do you know if it tastes any different uh i mean it's not i wouldn't say it tastes purple or anything like purple potatoes don't taste purple either like you know purple weed usually has like a purple taste to it purple purple vegetables on the other hand they don't they don't seem to have that purple taste i demand a refund right on yeah no no no that ain't gonna work i want more than just color well i thought that um if there was a difference it was subtle and as we talked to the table we thought you know it's cauliflower ain't got that much going for it anyhow so it's if you're talking subtle differences in cauliflower it's probably not very noticeable so have you ever had riced cauliflower yeah sometimes made into like crusts and stuff like that too yeah or even like mashed mashed potatoes but it's really cauliflower yeah that's good too i've had that that was yeah i've had that's it's interesting and like it sounds gross but then when you eat it it's like oh [ __ ] it's actually not bad dude my favorite is cauliflower steaks have you had those come on now yeah man you take those things and you you take the cauliflower and you cut it right down the middle so it's like right down the brain and then from there you slice steaks and they're they're big not crescent shape but brain looking like a slice of big old brain you can make it as thick as you want put as much uh rub or whatever you want on there and uh if you cook it right man it gets nice and tender and juicy and absorbs the flavors and it's yummy it's good yeah you should do that all the grilling you do you should do a cauliflower steak man you're going to wait till i come over huh yep i'll wait for you for that one all right my man was not jumping at that was he coffee the pizza thing we'll we'll try it the mashed potatoes it's good i don't know about the cauliflower steak though well don't think of it as a steak it's just a big slab it's a slab of cauliflower and it'll be a side dish for you you can still have your steak but that'll be my main course it's good though man i've had a few of them there's one in the restaurant down the street that's fantastic oh do they still do it ever since covered if they had trimmed on their menu they'll have it yeah did you eat a lot of cauliflower as a kid a lot of vegetables as a kid oh no no no no people people people would describe me as someone who's allergic to vegetables a good seven eight years ago so so as a kid you weren't you weren't anything close to vegan or vegetarian no meat and potatoes grilled cheese i was pretty much raised on dude ads through middle school and a little snack those birds like chex mix do dads yeah that was a name brand it was a chex mix uh basically i was in uh elementary and middle school and that was pretty much what i come home to is uh yeah some of those like crack like cracker jack is that one of those things it's like a chex mix okay so you know you take that they had like cheez-its and pretzels and [ __ ] i don't know what those chex mixy things are called chex mixes i guess checks whatever they are you know i mean like the grid things but anyhow those things and uh it was good man i used to plow through those after school so i was not into veggies i ate a lot of pizza rolls like gino's pizza rolls i think i think when they first came out they were called totinos though yeah or maybe maybe gino's was the first one and now they're totinos i don't know yeah i'm not an aficionado enough to tell you that but i'll man those things they were so good but they're not you know what i mean right right i mean they're still they're still pretty good but not not not good you know you know what i mean either i wouldn't go near them now but i loved them back in the day man yeah man you make you make pizza rolls on a charcoal grill they come out like kind of crispy a little smoky really really good all right yeah like it's like pizza rolls are you gonna homemade pizza rolls oh they mean they're frozen of course the frozen you know from the freezer section gino and totino broke up man that's a shame so it's like gino's on the east coast and totino's in the west coast is that what's going on just eno i have no idea i know that uh totino's is what we would get out here usually okay so if it is a breakup it's my my side gets tortillos i can tell you that i remember the commercials you used to show a whole pizza being rolled up and then made into little little rolls little little pockets little pillows pizza pills yeah those are the days huh you could eat those without without thinking no the trick was always to make them without making them explode you got to like heat them up get them crispy but not make them all like bust their nuts all over the inside of the oven oh my god can you even do that in a microwave in the microwave i don't know there's probably an art to it you probably probably only only can cook seven at a time and they have to be in a perfect circle and you have to use 65 percent power and a pause after a minute and a half or something like that for a microwave use but for the oven you can totally do it for the charcoal grill you can totally do it we should do a video about how to perfectly cook pizza rolls i thought those pizza pocket sleeves were like magic remember those that that that seriously improved the pizza pocket for me the hot pocket sleeves yeah whatever those damn things were yeah hot pocket that sleeve worked telling you i would [ __ ] up a hot pocket right now [ __ ] jerry i'd throw it against the wall i haven't had a hot pocket in a long time yeah i love the the philly steak and cheese croissant pockets those were oh man that was some good food man that [ __ ] tore me up i won't do it again but it was good food i'll tell you that sure as [ __ ] tastes so good yeah so we gotta we got 93 people in the chat how can we can we get started on the 100 likes so we can we can dab after jerry tells us his stories tonight let's just start it now let's just let's just start start hitting the like button we got 25 likes right now 94 watching before you leave hit the like button and uh tell us in the chat if you ever grew up did you grow up like when you were a kid did you did you make rules for yourself did you did you define who you're going to be as an adult whether those definitions came true or whether you realize that the context of your decision making skills that you used as a child weren't accurate chances are you made a lot of decisions as a child or did a lot of thinking went through a lot of scenarios that somehow shaped your your adult personality and sometimes sometimes we need to go back and uh reflect on those and revisit those and maybe rewire those and jerry's been talking to me uh about it in the past about how he's been been sessioning at his desk and doing doing uh some self-reflection drills getting real high and thinking deep having big revelations about about uh thoughts and experiences of his childhood and how how they made him who he is today and how he can even change some of those things so i want to go down that road tonight and i want to get the chat involved to see how they all feel about about where they are now versus you know when they were a child like are you the person you thought you'd be in the chat how about you jerry are you are you the how old are you 45 42 32 52 52 are you the 52 year old man that you thought you'd be when you were no man no i don't know i mean in some ways maybe like i always wanted long hair hey never did it but i didn't get that till the last couple years so um maybe maybe along those lines but i don't know as a kid you even think about what kind of person you want to be i mean let's just kind of think about what you want to do you know what i mean like as a kid i think what i'm going to do or i'm going to make money where am i going to go but i never thought about who do i want to be as a person i don't know maybe that's part of the problem maybe that that's interesting that you say you phrase it that way because i i always struggled with that as a kid and i i could always have visions of who i wanted to be and what i wanted to be like but not what i wanted to do and that's it even today like i still don't know what i want to do when i grow up like i i love what i'm doing right now but i i i still can't vision [Music] like what's what's the end what's the end of 420 vape zone i mean obviously i got deleted from youtube so that was the end of that but that's not the end of my effort that's not the end of my energy that's not the end of me changing the change in the space i'm still gonna [ __ ] do that so youtube doesn't define my ending i do but i i don't know where that ends and i'm okay with that i didn't used to be like when i was when i was when i was a kid i didn't want to start something and unless i could see it through to the end and knew how it was going to end like all those uncertainties almost made me not want to do things but now it i just whatever yeah the uncertainty and the the fear kind of keeps us from really leaving the familiar and going out and doing anything you know um um my wife and i were talking today about some of our dreams and i've been lately i've been dreaming more than ever last couple last this year you know 2020 sucked a lot of ways but for me i grew a lot and i've been dreaming a lot more and so she she and i were talking about our dreams for a while and then today she she said uh so hey man what what uh how we going at these things and i was like i don't know yet you know but i'm walking around like like you know it's already there and uh then she's like oh okay i was like i don't know how it's gonna happen yet i haven't figured that out i'm not really sure but i know it's gonna like i mean it's already out there i know it's coming um but part of it i think is just the joy of watching it unravel and unfold and uh and of course influencing and doing what i can but at the end of the day how things line up is is going to blow my mind and um that's kind of weird man like i've never been like that before so uh it was funny when we had that conversation we were asking questions that are normal for me just a little while ago that now i'm kind of operating out of bounds that's kind of weird so you you've been you've been doing some reflecting you're at your altar you've been calling your altar uh how did this start like how how did you start with with the [Music] identifying the stuff in in your past from like your youth because i know i know like when we talked about it you were like yo like you you had the specifics and and you you knew exactly like this one time like how how did you go from not having like an awareness of of hey i might be a little bit [ __ ] up because of this one time at band camp to to figuring that out like you you were getting high you were thinking you were reflecting were you journaling like what how does this go how how can people dive into these things yeah that's a good question man um it really just becomes whatever's gonna get you to kind of inward direct you know and and really focus your attention inward but um for me at the beginning of this year i started doing some uh energy work uh with a with a woman here in town that um had done some with my wife and we both really liked what we saw and just said i wanna i want a taste of that and um i don't know if uh it was that that started it or if it was that that started my intro flexion that started it but one way or another you know i would i would go to these um appointments and get get my work done and then come home and reflect on the things that we dug up and excuse me and because uh pretty much most of my time alone uh to my thoughts was when i was having a session that's when i would kind of kind of reflect and so that's how kind of uh things started moving towards my sessions becoming kind of a meditation um so that's kind of how the whole thing started um at first this is this is it right here first that was my stage i built that to take pictures i was literally like man i need something else to take pictures i like my desk it's always cluttered i need something just go in there real quick drop a vape do that and i've got some [ __ ] on instagram like that that you can see back in the day we're all like i like my whole season of this kind of stuff you know with this silver bottom and all that um and then then it got to where i was doing videos in use and then pretty soon i just had always had a badass rig set up there and so i was like well might as well go ahead and just have sessions there and then as as they started to become sessions of uh uh you know reflecting inward um i started to become more intentional and and deliberate and started to really think about what i was doing building a routine and that's when the stage turned into an altar because [ __ ] was happening there now it wasn't just i'm going to hit my vape it was i go there and change my life now so um it's pretty cool i love it that that that vaping uh uh marijuana has become a part of that for me it's it's it's become a real um it's become a spiritual thing for me you know i mean that's where i do that's where that's right that's where i go to grow all right but it started with the energy work and um that was really techniques to kind of identify layers that need to be peeled off and then peeling them off and then when i would come back and you know she she would point out uh what what these layers were from not specifically but just kind of generally and then i would go back and you don't have to do this i just liked it because i'm kind of like that i like i like [ __ ] into stuff so i would dig in and start to find things that would have made sense and then um but but when i really realized i was getting somewhere is when when i dig in and i'd find the emotional footprint like when i could go back and recall the experience to the point where i could remember it and feel it that's that's when i knew that that was the signature that told me that that was actually the truth right there like you can go through and feel that emotion in that moment and you can heal and so that's what i would do is i started going in and um reliving those moments and and uh just letting the the emotion flow flow over me and through me and uh it got i think i've talked to you before in the past about how some of the physical things are really cool just uh sometimes when you really focus on literally the physical sensations of an overcoming emotion it's exhilarating and it can be addicting man because that the physical feelings when when you take away the fear that's involved the physical feelings are sensational and toxic strong especially anger i can see why anger is something that a lot of people get addicted to because that emotion is intoxicating when you when you are when your attention is on the physical aspect of it because it really is a strong physical change that kind of thing there so so anyhow that's that's kind of what i was doing over there and that's beautiful man i love that is that yours did you grow that one no this is uh grape runts great bronze i remember hearing about that little focus almost you had it a minute ago but you know it's doing what it does yeah they don't want to play with you but it's so beautiful i want it to focus there there there yes snap that's it you got the rotation going it stays with you other side isn't that glorious yeah it is i've managed to i bought this ounce like almost three months ago jerry for 350 bucks or something stupid i bought it all to squish it and i fell in love with it after vaping it so much that i actually went and i bought a 10 pack of seeds from the genetics company that that made this so i'm going to grow it i'm going to grow it fantastic been cherishing saving the last nugs and i'm breaking out a big one tonight pick out the big one did you squish any of it i did squish some of it and it didn't i i [ __ ] it up when i squished it because i switched it too fast because that's what i do but it was so good as flour that i just couldn't bear myself to continue trying to squish it because it's this is this is the best flower i've vaped like this is this is my new favorite strain it tastes incredible that's awesome the high is magical it's bubbly and peppy and euphoric and this is uh it instantly became my favorite string like xj13 didn't do that actually 13 was like oh this is really good i think i might like this better than green crack and maybe even better than you know whatever and then slowly i'm like yeah i'm gonna keep buying this [ __ ] you know like great brunch i hit it once and it's like [ __ ] this is this is like a [ __ ] [ __ ] it's like the first hit dude that's dope yeah it's it's it's fantastic it's fantastic that got you going from the first hit man rock and roll i like grape things you know and grape is a really really nice flavor and the the candy subtle cotton candy kind of mouth feel of this is just perfect perfect all right now i got to look for some of that i'm about to get ready i'm starting to get to where i i just took an inventory for tonight what i was going to vape it was like i'm down to that so i mean i've got two things left and i'm i'm all right on each but i'm pretty much dry yeah i'm breaking out the grape runs ah right on that's why i have i have a couple ounces of some homegrown that isn't cured yet but i've been vaping on it anyway push through that you're that kind of guy push through yeah i'm just impatient plus it's nice it tastes pretty nice i had a good time with that dab that was good i'll be dabbing in a bit i'm gonna i'm gonna vape the bowl great brunch jerry great bronze cheers still using the mouthpiece by the way no kidding helping you a lot helping you a lot is it smoothing you out yeah yeah i'm still digging it i've i've dropped it on the floor a couple times and i i hit it without and i yep i i felt i should immediately go back to the mouthpiece wow i feel the difference yeah all right i'm gonna give it some more runs at some point one time i didn't feel a difference one time i did and then i was dabbing or something and did something different but you don't you don't see uh any kind of loss anywhere you don't sense anything no i feel a game i feel i'm able to take bigger hits without coughing my face off quite as much i feel it helps me that's good but taste everything nothing you know no nothing lowered what you don't lose any taste or anything no no i don't think so that tasted great that tasted like a can of slap your mama oh my god [Laughter] that's great man looks like a little tree that cute man is going that was so nice that is funny man man slap your mama did you have do you have did you have big things to unwire like from your childhood like for me i was i was raised religious like my my mom and dad uh were catholic i i went to [ __ ] set saturday and sunday school so like you know like sunday school like every saturday or everywhere every sunday whenever it was something that changed at some point uh i had to go to church every sunday with my parents you know wake up and get dressed and go to church and learn all the stand up sit down fight fight fight stuff uh all that i got all of it all all of those rituals uh it was it was i was it was expected of me and then as i grew up and and you know got married and separated from from my parents and became my own person religion went away like i immediately stopped going to church like as soon as i didn't have to anymore it's like no i'm not gonna [ __ ] wake up every sunday and go go do that thing to me that's that's no no no i saw so many things wrong with that scene already that it was already like red flags on my head like hold up like that that priest is up there is like telling all these people that they need to give you know 20 of their income to the church hold up like some something right here like some something like like red flags as a kid you know so like as an adult i not only did i have to like handle the on wiring of that but i also had to deal with my parental expectations still you know like i'd go to family christmas and my mom would you know talk to my kids like oh is your dad teaching you about jesus and my kids are like who you know i've been there man so that was a lot of [ __ ] that was a lot of [ __ ] yeah it was ccd ccd classes yeah people in chat recognize it yeah i went to ccd one time i got in trouble for for skipping ccd yeah i went i went i went uptown instead of going to the school where ccd was taught i i just went to the uptown district and was buying candy and shopping at this different schools and i saw my my mom's friend she saw you yeah she saw me and then yeah i saw troy uptown at the dime store or whatever she made sure she said that yeah yeah ouch yes yeah i unwired that thing but there was a there was a lot that i that i stumbled upon upon and i think i think jerry a lot of it honestly may have been triggered by me doing video work like me seeing myself on a screen and talking and almost having like a mirror you know because like i don't know if you'd ever did this but as a kid you know when you hit your emotional rough spots when you're going through puberty or whatever like i i remember being in the the bathroom like in the like in the mirror like like like [ __ ] this like um this is never gonna happen again you know like i'm i'm never gonna let billy take my bike or you know whatever the [ __ ] situation was like i'm i'm i'm gonna be this like i'm like from now on you know this this is home and you know that i had a lot of those memories and i think doing videos like made me start to recall some of those instances and then as i reflected on them as i like sat here like meditating and bringing as many details as i could you know back into it i i sort of understood that you know my my perception and my understanding of the world and other humans wasn't accurate at all you know as a 14 year old my my knowledge of the world was [ __ ] up like i was i was riding a skateboard and said to learn how to drive a stick shift and you know it's a completely different machine so now the context has changed so now looking back i i kind of feel like a lot of the things that i strived for or the decisions that i made as a child or like here's how i want to be when i grow up or i never want to do this and this and this and ever want to be that type of person uh those types of decisions were were made and made in [ __ ] concrete of a child you know stamping how he's going to be forever and ever amen without really having an accurate context and now as an adult i i can kind of go back and unwire things and like oh here here's how the world really works kid you know you made some stupid mistakes made some bad decisions or you know you you thought this when you should have thought this and you never changed you know you there there are things that that i never went oh on until now even you know and i believe and i'm open to there being more of those things like until i die there may be things where i go oh here's how the world works not this way you know that the way that i saw it when i was 19 or whatever you know there's there's so many different slots algorithms of this world i didn't even know in this world i was like that was awesome no i'm with you man i i kind of uh started similar as far as i had an episcopalian high school upbringing and as soon as i went to college i was like done done doing that on sundays um so i kind of get you on that um it's funny i look back on it now and and and going through all those services and rituals um i didn't really grasp any any real depth to it um whereas others in my family did and um now i get it though having kind of built up my own ritual that i go oh that's what a ritual is it's just a habit to get you focused you know to kind of get your attention on the now and and and what's going on and so um that's in my mind that's really all a ritual is and even even prayers are the same kind of thing to just kind of pull the attention to and to and to do it in in gratitude because that's how you actually change [ __ ] so um you know i've i've gone back and very little but i want i really want to do this now is i want to go back and and do some of the same same uh scriptural studies i did in my 20s and 30s but i want to do it with with understanding of things that i have now and i'll bet you it'll blow my [ __ ] mind i think it'll it'll it'll be crazy but the uh the stuff that i've hit mostly most recently troy has been has been younger than that for me um and the stuff that i got real recently here um took me back to when i was one which really surprised me i hadn't had anything come up that back um but basically uh i'd gone back as far as six on my own and could make some mental connections to three but then the the help i've gotten with the with the energy work has got me dialed in with some other things at three and two in one and um i've i've mine's been more going in and feeling it you know like uh i don't i think everybody's got to look yeah that's all about how i look joy [Music] oh man it was great i look like i don't know what you were muscling up there man you worked it that was awesome let me get that water going man but no i haven't been thinking so much of it is feeling it i've gone back and mostly i guess what i should say is i'm cleansing troy i'm going back and cleansing wounds that when i go back and look i go oh i can see why because of that wound i made these decisions and did this every time this stimulus showed up and and i'm i'm really surprised at how much stuff we find when we look back that we're not even thinking about man like who we think we are is just a bunch of programs we haven't been paying attention to at all and when i start to question why the hell i do that it really is kind of a dumb weird or old answer and uh some of them like you said were misinterpretations when you go back and we'll [ __ ] that this works now others are wounds that you know just need a cleansing like that so that they don't the next time that comes up you don't have to run that program again there's still the habit afterwards but i see the habit it's almost like it's easier to break maybe the yeah i only you almost see it immediately it's like an awareness that you get when you when you start to heal those things of what you used to do and you don't have to do anymore so um but i guess it's just some kind of meditation it's kind of funny man i think i've told you before man i'm i don't really prescribe to any thing really as far as like a doctrine or a belief or or what have you i have in the past um but um these days i just kind of pretty much believe if something's really true then then it's accessible to anyone uh pretty much anywhere anytime and that's the only thing i really kind of hold on to and given that i just kind of uh have really enjoyed stumbling through and working my own way through [ __ ] whether it was working through like some uh some some uh frequency [ __ ] or uh this kind of stuff you know um i'm having a lot of fun with it man but i'm really stumbling on to some stuff that i don't know it's just kind of changing me and then when i talk to people who who've been there they're like oh yeah that's kind of like x y and z over here and this is another one where um the what i what i do over there um is almost like it's like a program so basically now when i go over there to that altar i just i just run my program and i'll be damned if 25 minutes in i don't get hit with whatever it is that i'm gonna get hit with and lately it's it's happened in the first couple of minutes and even immediately so things have started accelerating on some things and so i think that means what i'm what i'm what i'm doing now is starting to sync up with the other work that i'm doing and really kind of fast forwarding a little bit um i know i'm there when i just start start uh crying it out and i just pretty much bawl sometimes i'll sit down cry as long as it takes a lot of fun man it feels good it's amazing too because as soon as i'm done it's like that weight is gone and sometimes i don't even know what it is but something's gone something feels better something's really you know what i mean like that there's a joy that comes it comes with on the other side and that's why i know i've really done something jerry that that hit that i took i accidentally bumped my torch up to temp four and said it's m3 so it was way more than i was expecting and it caused my head to get inserted into my own ass so that's good unfortunately i missed everything you said but hear me out uh it has since forced me back to time travel when i time traveled and i i caught it all i was able to like rewind my memory and like re-listen to everything you said just with a delay and i get it like going back like the program it's like a ritual you kind of developed like the go go down the path like the familiar territory you know like you got your scene you got your intentions and i love it man because awareness awareness alone can be curative you know so the the fact that you're sitting down with that intention you're aware of it you're you're setting your your brain on a mission you're consuming some cannabis which makes it easier for your your thoughts to translate your feelings to translate into thoughts and your thoughts to you know dissolve and submerge into your your your visions and your your mind all these things things are better and good for you i applaud you for taking the the time and energy to keep [ __ ] doing that that's self-improvement self self-awareness it's good [ __ ] i i started meditating a couple years ago and i immediately learned like i need to do more self-improvement and more things like that so good for you yeah thanks man well i'm i'm i enjoy it it turns out i have a taste for it man like i i for me it's it's a hobby now man like i love it and and and i i kind of crave it and if i'm not in here at least once a week i start to dry up a little bit and uh if i can get in here two or three times a week that's good i don't see why not more i've got a sign here asking me about it you know is it have you gone there today uh so um i'm trying to keep it on my mind to go over there and do things because um at first i was going in with some pretty well first i i don't know i was just trying to go deep i don't know what i was looking for at first but i think when i stumbled on some of the first cleansing moments that's when i realized wow that was that was really that was pretty pretty powerful and i want to try to do that again um and then when i was able to repeat it and uh i started [ __ ] while i said [ __ ] when i'm gonna refine it you know and so um i pretty much just came with a little routine that i'm still refining all the time um but um but it's designed to uh draw in all the senses so that i'm focused here and now so it's really designed to pull me in now and i have something to tend to each sense to to do that and um and then uh there's there's there's a timing to it that works with a flow that i've kind of works for me and um and then as i look at it more and more um like one of the last things i added was uh is i was like okay now um i've i've come in here and just done my thing and see what happens and done my thing and focus on some things but now i want to kind of come in and really um honestly i'm really grateful for for what's going on here and i wanted to [Music] thank the the the plant and and whatever was going on because i mean that was always a part of it and uh so i just started coming in and going okay well i want to i just want to say thanks to the plant first of all and really commune with a little deeper and then um i uh yeah dab time and then i um and so then basically that turned into uh kind of like what troy it's funny man now when i look back on like geez that actually sounds it sounds just like a prayer man that i would have said in church or before a meal or whatever the hell i'm kind of like wow so here i'm pretty much just coming to kind of going i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna sometimes i just come to and surrender and go whatever you want thanks i'm just stoked to be here other times i come in and go this is on my heart and then i go through my [ __ ] so but i need a dab let's do a dab i was i was the hundredth like and then and then i unliked and then a whole bunch of other people unlike where are we at now do i need to like i started a terrible trend i'm i'm sorry i'm back just in case man let's do it did we get to the hundred all right let's do it man it's at 104 now but it it hit a hundred i was the i was the hundredth and i i like i uh i unliked and then it went down to like 98 and i was like oh [ __ ] so i hit like again and then it went up and then it went down again and it went down another one so this has been i'm just catching up i'm at 103. so let's do it let me load this puppy up good call by the way yeah i'll have a dab with you are you what are you dabbing on the switch yeah i am but i want to clean it first so take your time setting up it won't take long but you know oh man jerry that that torch bowl of the grape runts yeah that did it for you holy [ __ ] temp four oh gave me shivers i can't wait to vape some more of that i don't even want to dab that hits harder than a dab right now that's awesome man i love it that's awesome nate bunn had a good question earlier what's that goddamnit nate i don't have to scroll up because i don't want to i don't want to misquote it you won't do that hmm where'd it go how do you feel about personal growth while regularly using cannabis do you feel like you progress or feel like time flies by at times that's a hard-hitting question my man that's hard it's kind of both yeah it's kind of both but here's the thing man time flies by no matter what so it's kind of hard to compare like i i look back at the years where i wasn't using cannabis it was it was a lot of years they blew by like nothing too like even the years that were really tough like the years of your of life that are [ __ ] super stressful like i remember when when i like a newborn baby and a toddler and and my job was really hard and it was it was some tough [ __ ] years like money was just like always tight my time was always in demand i was getting like two hours of sleep per night like i was getting calls every [ __ ] night at like three in the morning to have to go to work because like [ __ ] would break down like and code at the newspaper like [ __ ] was insane she was insane and i hated it i [ __ ] hated it i mean i was i was a rock star crushing it but i [ __ ] i was miserable it was miserable i i quit i worked there for like two years and then i i literally uh reached out to my old boss who had a com get really big and i'm like yo i'm like i i need a change and he hired me and that that's how i got to that dot com job but those two years were insane jerry when i worked for gannett i i was miserable i was a miserable person and i i always had i oh i was i was like addicted to tums like i was eating like tums i was going through a bottle of tums every month because like i had like acid reflux and heartburn from from all the [ __ ] stress of my job i was when i programmed people out of their jobs and all that stress was was haunting me you know but looking back all that time flew by flew by the worst years of my life flew by just like the best ones so many were there what do you mean how many crummy years in there no well that's that's the thing that's the thing if you would ask me that if you would ask me that seven years ago i probably would have uh painted a pretty shitty picture for you but through the ability of reflecting and having a better understanding of context having a better understanding of how the mind works how the mind changes how people grow up how people grow grow old things like that i've i've able i've been able to like readjust the context of my my life and understand mostly that i was just unhappy because i was misguided i was in the wrong place doing the wrong thing it wasn't yet aware of it i thought i was doing the right thing i was naive i was arrogant i was cocky i knew things that i didn't really know and those things are hard to hard to shake i was uncultured and it wasn't until i moved to california really and started really networking and meeting people and seeing all the different angles and all the different ways bigger business decisions are being made you know in the dot com space i it really it changed my perspective and you know i could i could think back and go oh god like working at the newspaper when i was always pissed off about these decisions it's like now i would make that same decision like now i would make that same decision so i was unhappy back then but i shouldn't have been so like now now like the whole the whole history i can kind of kind of repaint it i can kind of retell it i can i can change the narrative true dad and why wouldn't i right why be miserable have you seen miserable people have you seen the con like the comments that some of these people leave on forums and on social media like these [ __ ] haters and trolls yep that's how they are in life jerry because they just choose to be miserable they choose to let the the negative narrative lead their their life all you got to do is take some control have some perspective find some positivity find some happiness works online because there's no face-to-face response that you have to worry about you know you have to worry about any any real confrontation with most of what you do just choose to never go back if anything comes your way yeah it's it's even worse online but yeah charlie's nailing it charlie [ __ ] nails it love you charlie i feel the same way dude i've i've seen miserable people in the mirror you know i've been miserable um i'm gonna have a dab with you jerry i got mom ready i'm using the candy pens session right now testing it out what is this it's kind of like the g pen connect except it's made by candy pens oh sweet yeah is any better it's got a better atomizer less bad taste well i haven't i haven't figured it out yet but so far it kind of seems like it's the same ordeal like it has like the same little little plate that it wraps around and goes into the little little plate in the bottom god damn it why right like just give me a whole a whole smooth quartz cup and nowhere for [ __ ] to go forever right what the [ __ ] that's all i want that's all i want i'm waiting man i've had i've had a few dabs on it it hasn't seemed to be as bad as the kinect but it's it still has that taste yeah i think it might clean up a little better but i don't know yet i don't know yet that's too bad man same thing heats up in about 30 seconds or is it quicker 20 seconds 10 uh it heats up quick yeah it's [ __ ] real fast i turn my own off we go cheers guys this will be like a 30 second a 30 second vaporizing dab though i like that trigger happy exactly there's a difference between like clinical depression where you have a chemical imbalance and you know you could use medical help and soul-searching like when you're when you're displaced when you're you when you know you're not in the place that you need to be subconsciously depression is what you feel you're putting on the act that matches your surroundings of your body's place and time and environment but you know damn well it's not where you where you're supposed to be and what you're supposed to be doing it's hard to take action it's hard to do those scary things because they're all uncertain they're all uncertain and uncertainty you know you have you have your your bubble your bubble of awareness your bubble of of of certain things in life you have your little pocket of unhappiness down here in this this corner of the big circle right jerry this little uh unhappiness right here but the rest of the rest of the shit's like good and then up here you got like real happiness so you tend to like believe that all this area outside of the circle of certainty you know is probably going to be unhappiness or shitty things or whatever and you're just going to want to focus on what you know like i'm aware of this stuff up here that makes me happy so i'm just going to avoid all the the cloud of uncertainty but in reality when you start to explore the clouds of uncertainty you'll find that even what you thought was like true happiness is really just like mediocre happiness and there are really better happinesses and they're even bigger than all the little [ __ ] spots of unhappinesses and it it's just a matter of exploring the uncertainties and being okay with the uncertainties and being okay with all those unhappinesses that you might stumble upon too because life moves on [ __ ] happens things go away you know you never know when a piano is going to land on your head you're hit by a truck you never know acceptance acceptance is huge man and when you die you're gonna get thrown away your shit's gonna get thrown away i mean we're gonna be sad but eventually all your shit's gonna get thrown away and you'll be forgotten everything you build will be forgotten everything i build will be forgotten eventually everyone will forget about me and that's okay if i can accept that now it makes it really really easy to do whatever makes me happy right now without have having to worry about the judgment of people and that's what i like to focus on sometimes i like to think about the time after i'm gone after my family has mourned after my family is gone after their families have mourned a time where my life my presence my current perspectives all current judgments they're no longer relevant in this era i like the thing i like to think about at the time like that and it helps me understand that in fast forward a thousand years when all these emotions no longer matter come back to reality guess what all of those emotions still don't [ __ ] matter because time is irrelevant none of it man like my mom or someone i think it was my mom and at a saying when things are wrong she'd go you know there's a billion people in china don't give a [ __ ] and it's the same kind of thing i think about every now and as like you know at at least well really when you get down to it um 100 years from now no one will even know you and i were here like there will be no memory of you and i for anyone that's alive 100 years from now that's pretty much the way it's going to be maybe some exception a little bit around the edge there but you look at a couple hundred years from now you know i don't know where my family will be but you take that out further and you get into you know a couple thousand years from now [ __ ] man um we're digging up [ __ ] now 12 000 years ago that we didn't even know existed like i mean like you could easily just go look man 5 000 years from now nobody's gonna even know that this entire race was here like i mean [ __ ] my little problems it's like really like we're not far away we've forgotten holy [ __ ] if there was a mass extinction right now like right now if like all humans die right and we get fossilized wherever we are right now centuries millions billions of years later when some alien races are scanning the earth and looking at all like humans and entering them into a computer and they're they're gonna find like people that have hundreds and hundreds of vaporizers on their shelves no [ __ ] that'll be [ __ ] up and they're getting some weird ass [ __ ] over here in us some alien race is gonna be classifying they're gonna they're gonna be theorizing why how what did we do they're gonna find like a t-shirt they're gonna find some fossilized shirt like look look they worship this we we believe this is what these vaporizer fellows looked like right right you ever wonder about the [ __ ] we dig up there probably was meaningless but we like put this huge thing on it like oh they must one with the train had a beard [Laughter] the that's great i'm just kidding i don't have a bunch of porn that's that's the only thing i could think of the one with the the hat had no pants on yeah damn it why is he i'm actually wearing pants right now by the way it was cold brown like pants pants you probably never even see me in pants i've probably never seen you in pants have you no i wore our pants today yeah i wear pants at champs yeah i remember your own pants oh that dab was completely unsatisfactory so i'm going to take this candy pen session thing out of my rio and use the rio the way it's meant to be used as a rio sound good sounds like something you need to do there man look at you made a little little overpass with the the sticky bricks those things are cool man yeah the sticky bricks are arc de brick how's that awkward debris yeah that's true nate and it's true wouldn't they say yeah right the plastic yeah the plastic they are they're going to think what would these guys do i'll always come with bones and plastic oh plastic man that's great i did not see the article in usa today about the cycle of extinction that sounds actually really interesting someone said someone described it really nicely they said optimistic nihilism or optimistic nihilist i don't know what that means seed yeah sticky sticky brick underpass overpass would be if there's like traffic above but there's no technically i don't know sticky all right i'm gonna i'm gonna have a real dab with the rio and then i'm gonna have one more bowl have you checked out the one more bowl podcast jerry yeah man what do you think i like what you guys are doing man nice man thanks you got a good little group there yeah man i love all that [ __ ] brian makes man too that [ __ ] all the [ __ ] he's doing with the mask is hilarious i know that yeah yeah he's uh i think he's coming over tonight and he might be here right now for all i know he might be like parked outside is he got is he out there dosing up with his mask on probably he's supposed to be bringing me my mask awesome yeah i don't want to spoil it so i'm not gonna say any say anything else okay then man yeah that thing that that's right down your alley i think i think you could go do well with a mask i think so too i think it'll be fun it'll be fun oh [ __ ] mask man i love it jabu has checked it out thanks jaboo appreciate it ready for a dab who's dabbing with me we got we got 123 likes future cannabis project is good too i like i like that i like watching them dude i'm sitting this one out man i'm pretty big from that that thing that thing put a whoop on me man that was good are you what what what'd you say oh it's so delicious these thc diamonds i didn't even show you what i was dabbing on i'm sorry that was rude i'm sure you got more you can show mine's all drippy if i tilt it it runs it's really syrupy are you doing straight up diamonds or is it saucy diamonds and guns diamonds and guns guns i love it no i want to see it it's a wicked world that we live in jerry yeah it's cool i don't think it's quite as wicked where i am unfortunately see the sparkles yeah it's like a crumbly crystally thing yeah it's uh it's it's diamondy and there's like a little bit of like just a little bit of like terp sauce but just enough to like kind of coat and sugar that's was that a big chunk in there then yeah but it'll it'll break up pretty easily it does okay uh-huh well kind of i get what you're doing now there man i don't want you to break it out but he did look at this beauty oh yeah i gotcha you know i got multiple dabs what's this smell like it smells citrusy smells sweet and sour it's nice man i uh it's really potent it i can feel it my face oh hey why are you looking at my [ __ ] desk you're staring at my desk well we didn't want to look at your pantsless we thought we'd look down it took a fair point it's a very boring modest i finally emptied my debuller congrats man you finally emptied it [Laughter] this morning no yesterday that's about where mine's at over there man i think it's it's been a couple days i don't know probably longer because i i've got one over there to only use it for possessions so oh what up nate what about the aliens what happened with the aliens is is it something more than the israeli guy who's like in a home because that guy that guy said that donald trump also knows about the aliens which immediately discredits the story to me because i would if donald trump knows about aliens and he's kept it a secret yeah i don't think so that man tweets too much it might have scared him i mean the aliens can be pretty goddamn scary are you scared of aliens jerry scared of no you believe in yeah yeah all day long have you seen him no the movies i've seen some movies yeah but uh have you seen fire in the sky no is that a movie or a factual event you're asking me about fire in the sky is a movie no i haven't seen it do you believe in lizard people uh i don't disbelieve in them i hadn't really thought much about it do you believe in unicorns i don't know i've never seen one hadn't been asked if i believe in them before i've never been challenged on my belief in unicorns uh have you ever seen a rhinoceros yeah i've seen those i mean not like in person but i mean so no i've never seen that either or have i seen another zoo maybe i don't know is a rhinoceros not a unicorn well is it right now is there's a horse with a horn it's not a horse but does it fly is a unicorn really a horse they got wings right what no you're thinking of like a pegasus oh unicorns don't don't fly around away i don't think unicorns have wings do they i don't know man but i thought my unicorns do what you don't believe in them if they have wings have you ever seen a purple cow no i've seen a purple cauliflower that's that's true we thought we were going full circle to the cauliflower yeah right so have you had purple asparagus probably that doesn't sound like completely out of bounds to me like i think i may have heard that you know i mean the asparagus a lot of times there's purple tips anyhow so i could see that being perfectly different purple tip asparagus yeah those little on the ends a little i don't know what's going on man the flowers asparagus flowers the tasty part the tip the tip the tip with the ribs purple carrots i like i like purple carrots purple purple potatoes do you know what i think carrots are tasty those little those little little organic i like buying those like grilling noses or like saute them and butter and then i'll throw them on the grill you described the you said the purple taste earlier but can you describe the purple taste yes i can please do imagine tasting the color purple i know sorry that was an [ __ ] thing uh so it's like if you were to taste grapes and then taste a different variety of purple grapes and then taste blueberries and then taste some like purple flower or a blue flower they would all taste different but they would all have a similar essence that's kind of how the purple weed tastes like it doesn't taste like grapes or doesn't taste like blueberry but it has the essence of the flavors that are also found within grapes and blueberries you know um i've never thought of it that way but you hit me deep there man i'm i'm excited to look into that the essence the taste the essence of colors and taste wow that's going to be fun to uh to explore have you ever eaten a flower i think maybe a couple times i don't remember the color i think they were maybe red or orange probably more pinkish yeah a lot of the edible flowers are like white and red and white and pink okay they were sweet you could pull them apart and there was a little sweet honeysuckly kind of thing in the middle oh you got into it yeah well that's what we had on the playground man that's all we had you know you're on the playground whatever plants are around and that's what we at hey there's some flowers let's see uh what happens when we pull them apart and suck on them that's pretty much what you did right carrots knows about the purple cow is that a real thing i think so oh wait is the purple color real thing yeah it is like there's real purple cows like they come out well no it's it's a marketing philosophy about being unique and standing out and being remarkable you know you're driving down the [ __ ] road you're driving across nebraska you see cows and cows and cows you see brown cows and black cows and white cows and hairy cows and cows with longhorns but end of the day they're all [ __ ] cows you see a [ __ ] purple cow holy [ __ ] you're gonna remember that [ __ ] forever so when you're doing your thing that other people they're doing be a purple cow you know set yourself apart find find a way to to make yourself so unique that nobody else can can do that i like that yeah man purple color seth godin good [ __ ] all right i don't know how his last name was pronounced all of his books are really good and they're all kind of quick reads i have most of them if you ever come come here and want to get high and read books i have all of his books or most of his books oh that's great man if i come out to la and just come to your place and start reading you let me know wake me up or something man i because i can hang out with you i can read later so years ago my my wife's nephew like spent spent like a month with us because he he uh had an internship like at uh at a factory he was an engineer he was an engineer and he had an internship at a factory in the midwest um john deere he had an internship at john deere so he spent like the summer with us and he started reading my my books and he's and he learned to program at my house no way that's nice and a year later he founded a company that ended up being bought for like three million bucks or something like that yeah like he he became a computer he was a he was a [ __ ] 3d engineer like a mechanical engineer yeah like a young one like doing an internship at john deere read read he read the big red fez he read the purple cow and he read some other [ __ ] at my house and he started talking programming i started teaching him like javascript and he started learning all these different gaming things i gave him access to my web server and he went on his way and now he's like that's what he does now he works for blizzard nice for fun basically yeah it sounds like he'd do whatever he wants so yeah well that's fun man i guess he likes uh doing stuff for blizzard the program and they probably you know give him some leeway that's cool he loves he loves programming he loves game he always said like he he wanted to be like a game programmer dude that's awesome man so you do is come you know hang out in troy's garage for a month and be a different person that's true i like that i'm going through a whole tree yeah man charlie i love to hit up san diego i san diego so many [ __ ] awesome things in san diego i also live my life by marketing philosophy and marketing philosophy books i uh i was a programmer turned marketer and what's interesting jerry is i i always hated marketing and marketing people like as a programmer it was like it was a thing like programmers programmers hated marketing and marketers and then i became one i became a marketing person you flip sides man i knew you were gonna do it damn it [ __ ] troy flip it over i gotta clean my my banger actually i want to i want to vape more of this uh grape bronze but i do want to clean my banger because i'm afraid that i'll get high and what the [ __ ] was there a blue q-tip in my is that okay this q-tip is different than the others sorry i want to clean up the dark crystal before i forget it's dark crystal and i load a dab in there and kill myself is that one of those snappy ones or is that just a plastic one it's a it's a plastic one emits a box of of white paper ones the plastic ones bug me because they'll get all bendy from the heat yeah that's why i took took note of of a coming out of the box [ __ ] that man i don't know why it's in there i i assume maybe my wife just dropped it in there because all right well i'm gonna pack a bowl over here because i want to hit this thing you pack a bowl you're gonna do a dab right i'm the uh i'm gonna have a bowl too man the mic is gonna suffer you gotta let me know how bad it is who's gonna suffer the uh the microphone okay this is where all oh zach can you hear me yeah i can hear you does it does it suck a little bit so are you going now is that better how's that that's that's okay you're good all right so that'll work so i'll just yell over there are you going to show us your ritual well no that's like a long thing but i mean i can show you my stuff over here you know do you with your ritual do you masturbate before or after or during or all three that actually hasn't made its way in with any regularity at this point okay um you know when when when it's time it'll become something that happens all the time i guess but you know no at the moment that's just you know that's just kind of you know you never know when kind of things so oh spontaneous i like that spontaneous yeah yeah you know so um but i'll just kind of come over here i can talk real quick but no i'll just point out some things real quick and then i'm just gonna you know beat up a bowl but um i when i was [ __ ] around with taking pictures on it i got this little spotlighty kind of gooseneck thing that i could aim anywhere and really kind of focus on something and so i i did that and then i realized well man that's actually kind of sets the mood and so that kind of started with i was like wow man you know if i really turn all the lights out in the room and just have that it it really draws my focus right to here with about 80 of my stimulus just right there on that focus and then i started thinking okay uh how can i get sound more involved i like playing music but then i got real regular and got a playlist going that's pretty consistent and then you know for touch i like to you know uh well i'll start with smell you know so you got to smell it and then and then i like to touch it you know whether it's uh breaking it apart nuggets or just you know putting the whole thing in um and then so i engage and then the taste of course during vaporizing so i try to do all that in the process of it um i've got about two songs that get me through the i'm putting the weed in stuff i got another song that time's up for when i'm probably gonna start vaping and then about two or three songs later uh i've kind of sat and relaxed into a mode where i can kind of dig in and kind of get there and then the song is kind of helping you that too it's a lot of reggae it's been built up for a while but um uh i dig it man but uh i just want to beat up this bowl over here so i'm looking at on the screen going damn i want to beat that thing up so i'm gonna go beat that up now over here are you doing a dab now try now i'm going to vape a bowl jerry and well while i'm loading it i'll uh i'll uh i'll i'll confess something here i'll uh go back on topic to the childhood thing and uh i i've i think i think i've i've figured something out about myself yeah uh because i i i'm i'm reluctant to see a doctor like i don't like doctors oh my god only going to the doctor okay okay uh even when i have problems like i'm like oh my god i'll deal with that you know gaping hole in my arm or whatever like i just don't want to go see a doctor you know and i think i mean i i i know i was traumatized by a dentist and and i i i relate to that with with my not wanting to go to a dentist as frequently as i need to but with the medical doctor thing i think some of it may stem from like my mom like at a young age like every time she had to go to the doctor it was always you know bad things bad things bad things you know so i i feel i feel like that somehow [ __ ] me up as a kid like a little bit like like i don't want to go doctor because that means i'm going to die or you know like i don't know like there i feel like there there was some [Music] some medical anxiety that that stems from [Music] my mother's situation because when i was a kid i was told that my mom only had 10 years to live okay so i was told that my mom had 10 years to live and i like i did the math i'm like okay so she got it when i was one so like she'll die by the time i'm 11. and she always wanted me to pray that she would live to see me graduate high school and she did she actually lived long enough to see me graduate high school and then i was really [ __ ] scared to graduate high school like almost like it's like oh [ __ ] like if if if god gave her long enough to let her see me graduate high school now i'm graduating high school like now the promise is kept you know yeah that was all [ __ ] up that was all that was awesome [ __ ] up [ __ ] but even then like the the doctor thing like now like uh you know my wife is like like doing the thing she's like oh you gotta go get your your uh what the the doctor doctor you know you got to go see a doctor woo-woo doctor woo-woo yeah doctor i don't know how many fingers go up there i got it sorry good i get it now sorry so you need to go then is that what you're getting ready to say what are you going to the doctor then no that's not what i said yes i am i'm going to i'm going to go to the doctor eventually purple is a smell too yeah oh and and they were talking in the chat about the flowers like nate wants to know thank you kenny by the way for the the signal uh nate wants to know more about edible flowers dude come to california come to california there there are a lot of edible flowers here and a lot of restaurants that will uh have a dish that's you know fancy with with some flowers that come on the plate so it's plated all fancy with flowers maybe not right now with coved though so i don't know i don't know let's talk on the edible flower thing what kind of flowers you talking like illegal flowers in some places why california just because they have it there or is it because the league like legality no no they're legal everywhere it's just flour like edible flower petals like have you ever eaten a dish that came with some flowers on it like a salad or a steak or a pork chop or with some like rum yeah i had to kick that [ __ ] off what was that all about oh man you eat that [ __ ] yeah i'm [ __ ] with you man i had caramelized our biscuits didn't i mentioned that before i had a really good dish with caramelized biscuit flowers i hibiscus petals it was good oh yeah hibiscus did you vape them no this was in a dish they were caramelized nice you can vape hibiscus flowers too man they taste like cherry it's really nice i have to give that a try hail to the yeah yeah all right i'm gonna vape this this uh this great bronze this this put me ass over 10 cups earlier in the stream yeah it's going to be anything left to you this would be good we'll see we'll see cheerio brian hasn't knocked on my door yet is brian outside brian ryan you're out there masked up passed out because whiskers on that was my i like that name for his mask man i like to call that double one whiskers we'll see that's what i call it if i had it in my house like oh let me get whiskers and i'll get rid of that yeah me and whiskers will get right on that hang on [Laughter] whiskers that's a good name that's a good name hello hello that was a good hit that's a good hit let's finish it finish him ouch the top of that bowl is hot don't touch top of the bowl jerry don't touch the top of that bowl don't touch that bowl i'm standing back finish him all right i'm coming back i'm standing right he's outside okay good brian's outside man he's not he's bri no man dave's not here right brian's not outside reiner hey man is brian there i'm brian he's in the chat he said that he's in the chat how about that at least i'm getting hammered here man this is great i love those bowls over there man yeah i mean that's why i can get deep i'm getting whacked over there first that's what she did yeah man ain't that right heads down man heads down troy hey oh it wasn't muted i'm sorry oh that's great man wow you're gonna hit it the filter really smooths it out so then like you you feel it and it's like oh god like oh oh what's it taken out why is it smooth i think it's capturing whatever little reclaim would be landing in my throat because like i can see it's got some like stain like it's not white anymore it's a little bit yellow you know it's catching something so there's probably caption it's catching the biggest droplets so that what comes through is finer it feels more like a mist it's gentler and that's why you can take a bigger hit maybe yeah because because i think it's the bigger droplets hitting your throat to make [ __ ] rough uncomfortable so if that's the case and you won't lose any taste you'll just lose some potency because of the bigger globs but it's the it's the potency that hurts so um if you're gonna lose some i guess that's the good one right but then but then we go back to the math like i may lose three percent but i'm already exhaling 50 so what am i really losing am i losing anything or is it negligible well i'm losing it before i i cut it in half anyway it depends on what the real numbers are because that's all just made up [ __ ] so i don't know well the the 50 is not made up [ __ ] that's that's how that's how the lungs work you can only inhale half of what's inhaled because the method of absorption is diffusion so things balance out between the between the blood capillaries and the the sex so you're saying that your hit isn't going to be any weaker for lack of those droplets no no no i'm not saying i'm not saying that i'm i'm actually i'm actually concerned that if anything the filter would be catching like terpenes like like specific things that it would catch not necessarily just cutting my thc in half i'm concerned about losing uh ranges of terpenes that may get easily filtered by like an active charcoal filter right like and i can't i don't have any way of testing that nah just if you it's going to be anecdotal at best for a while where you just have to hit with and hit without and see you know if you notice a difference uh look at the filter over time maybe smell the filter over time i notice it's it's kind of sticky okay does it have a smell i was going to show you my my booch my hard mucha i got a yeah it smells like bong water really and it smells like dirt like a dirty bong did you did you combust did you eat a cherry no i haven't combusted because the carbon doesn't have any smell when it goes in clean i don't think i smelled it didn't smell anything yeah it doesn't taste like anything with your filter and it doesn't taste like anything nope doesn't smell either i mean it does have a bong smell like a dirty bong smell interesting well maybe that's good that it's in there and not in you yeah you know what i'm saying that could be right yeah i'll probably replace the filter somewhat soon i'm gonna drink this hard kombucha i drank one of these in the one more wolf i i bought two of them because i was going to try to drink jerry and i bought two of them to drink in the one more bowl podcast and i couldn't even finish the first one it was like i got halfway through and i'm like [ __ ] this thing sucks and then this one's been in the fridge ever since but this one you didn't like the taste no yeah though it sucked like you know i like kombucha i like kombucha it's a it's like sometimes they're a bit vinegary sometimes they're a bit trash watery but i i like them like i like the the sparkling ones uh the hard kombucha where it's like 6.5 alcohol i haven't found one that's good this is only my second one the first one was like a hibiscus thing oddly enough and it didn't taste then hibiscus enough i mean it really tasted like trash water like it taste it tasted like somebody poured a bunch of wine and a bunch of leftover beers into their trash and then picked out all the actual trash and then just poured it into a glass that's what it take so bad like a couple cigarette butts this one is sunset trio with a hint of passion fruit orange and guava that how can you go wrong with that right passion fruit orange and guava sounds good here we go it's better uh no it's not great but that's better it's a lot better than the previous yeah sorry about that never snorted kimbo jim no i wouldn't i wouldn't do that i think the problem is it needs to be in a bottle who's that's carbonated somebody snorting kombucha what the hell's that one though right there you go all right well jerry i i ground up a very precious nug yeah how much you got left had enough for a bowl not enough not enough for a bowl but i didn't grind up the whole nug i only ground up like the bottom portion of it oh gosh so are you gonna well how much you know i mean how much do you i mean [ __ ] that's hitting you hard enough doesn't look like you need to blow through it i'm i'm probably gonna finish this tonight this is unless brian is on his way here then i'll share it with brian brian you better hurry up man i get over there just to get in on this man you within uh driving distance to get in before he finishes uh friends i think he lives 30 minutes away get going brian hurry up jump in the car get going probably left i hope so man we'll see we're busy as long as we're gonna drop my door it's [ __ ] great ah that's funny so who's who's low in the chat anyone low anyone low out there we need to get a sesh going i'm ready get set going i guess i'm gonna do another dab over here man i'm gonna rape this grape this [ __ ] did a good job of wiping out this this if i this might this might make me quiet like i'm real close to quiet high man quiet high yeah they're quite high quiet because they're just it's just like what's it called when they're the same letters an anagram is that like an anagram is like when you oh yeah that's a good point i didn't see that i know i was talking about quiet high like i'm real close to just kind of all of a sudden watching you for a while [ __ ] hey you know did you see the uh large brilliant cuts did you pre-order your large brilliant cut i don't have it yet hold up is it out already i i i i did put in my order i i almost i almost scooped weed and directly into my bong no you don't want to uh no i don't want to do that good job troy i was like man my my bowl is so small good thing good thing i [ __ ] caught that that sucked yeah i don't want to say no grape runts that would suck we don't want to see that i'm gonna switch over to crystal i think crystal you're gonna start smoking crystal meth now instead of weed no is that what i said it sounded like that that's the direction you were going [Music] no i'm going into quartz mode because i'm gonna go oh okay of course mode on the switch okay we're looking at a train so we don't have the full context of you of the words in your scenario context context right yeah and you guys wanna yeah i get you man i get you so sorry about that there you go context loading this puppy context is so important and it's never really taken into consideration like when let's say when when you and i are discussing something in we have a disagreement rarely do i even get a [ __ ] about the context of your current like situation or why you would feel away i'm only concerned that it i disagree with it and now we got a compromise around it it's the the context of it is often an afterthought and in in life it's never a forethought holy [ __ ] i lost 420 wipes yeah man i need to get me some of that i i just ran out these things are great man i've been blowing through them do they still smell like almond i don't know these aren't new oh these are probably yours you [ __ ] you stole my wipes no you didn't take them remember from milwaukee from madison no from champs oh when you were giving them away and i didn't pick yeah yeah you said i didn't take them but you didn't you didn't give them out they were out they didn't do yourself they just didn't get taken anyhow i can send you some and i can send you a couple glass jars too that you should have taken because uh we'll figure out a reason why but yeah that'll be fun i'll send you some because it got a couple things let's put it together what else is it gonna clean this i was gonna clean this all right so are you are you waiting on me now or what's going down oh no i'm gonna i'm gonna hit hit mine well i'm about to pack this up so hang on i forgot did you order a large brilliant cut i i made my request i picked my colors i'm excited super me too i don't know when it's coming out is it almost there i believe they're like on the cusp of shipping or shipping now dude that's gonna be great man like people on on reddit are reporting that their status has reported the shipped and my best my best buddies who like literally i think he lives like in the same town where they're made like he says that his is shipped i wonder if he got his cool he didn't give him a check right i appreciate that land's crucible inscrutable what's up oh he's recommending i think it's a book or a video or a movie i don't know yet i have to like come back and rewatch the stream and google it which i usually do yeah see you ricardo i do have some torched azuriums i need to i need to do some more giveaways i need to do some more giveaways i got a bunch of things to give away but i need to get my youtube thing rebooted oh jerry i'm so excited to do these reboots i got a lot of [ __ ] coming man awesome i got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming yeah how long we got to wait not very long every long there should be should be video out here in the next three days fantastic yep yep i think i'm gonna go on the whole like one video a day kick or even multiple videos per day going live no not going live so much just cranking out video videos just to re-establish my my my video footprint on youtube i think you want to man yeah if i'm editing old videos and releasing new videos there there may be some days where like i i have multiple videos publishing same thing people are just gonna have to tolerate old videos publishing tolerate it'll be great we all want them back up man what are you talking about get that [ __ ] well yeah there's no there's only like 200 300 subscribers right now so it's not like i'm annoying 38 000 people like i would be before hey what are you dabbing is that zen this is your thing but it's not your stuff i had to use this for some stuff that i got that came in silicon so okay okay this is the saw but you did recognize that beautiful yeah yeah i was like what the [ __ ] are you getting zen like in florida holy [ __ ] oh i wish man because the stuff that was in here was amazing man yeah yeah was that uh lemon mint or what was what did you get this one was um where is he i had i had two of them oh this is uh the grape gelato is what was in here before what's in here now wow what's in here now is nothing like that so i'm i'm i'm not in the same ballpark anymore but this is a glass jar i still had a ring because i don't know i just had it around every now and then i get [ __ ] in silicone i don't want to keep my sitting silicone so i'm glad when i have something like this lying around but it sure did remind me of what really good [ __ ] was when i opened it i was like oh i got to clean that out now you know there's a little nothing up the smell a little bit all right did you hit that yet i didn't look i was good no man i'm sorry i know i don't want you to i'm loading up i spaced out that's my troll let me load this up i'm ready to though are you ready uh i believe so let me just check my tip real quick well my lights just came on yeah i'm ready my light's been on my humidifier just came on yeah i'm ready and i'm on a quartz time so it'll take a little longer so you let me know when it's time to go i'm i'm hitting flowers so i can hit it once you hit yours and i'll i'll tell you all right turn it on cheers guys you guys are loaded up like like we are hey you know you didn't get the new bubble cup from um from dr debra like the new standard standard cap yeah it's uh it's over here but it doesn't fit this black thing so i don't use it on here because i like having the seal so um don't club them baby seals so [Music] that definitely tasted cleaner [ __ ] yeah damn that's delicious wow i like that one that was a good one troy that was nice i really enjoyed that hit i'm gonna stir it up a little bit don't you quit damn hold up i'm paranoid about something right now things are slowing down for me man damn i'd say sorry but i know it hasn't even been a second for you guys because everything's going so slow for me man [ __ ] hmm boy how was it hey maybe staring at my abv am i the bowler right i was looking at that [ __ ] man dude that was [ __ ] righteous man like actually i put this on about three or four different rigs and wasn't that great but that was really good right there are you talking about the concentrate or the concentrate yeah okay yeah you know sometimes you find one and it pairs better with some rigs than others for some reason this one pairs well with the quartz on this not the not the stock titanium i didn't like that so much the quartz wow that was great but hasn't it hasn't done much for me on any other rig i've got um [ __ ] you look high man better vape on a riser what goes it goes to liquid damn and i got some trippy [ __ ] on the big tv up here too that i started doing yeah like sponge shongle no remember i told you i showed you i had the the astronauts up there the other day so now i've i've got some fractal [ __ ] up there man so he's got some fractal you're marks [ __ ] me man whoa you look different without glasses right what the [ __ ] because you can't see my eyes oh man imagine if i could open them do i look different without glasses i haven't seen you with glasses except when i impersonated you no yeah i mean when you take off your glasses do i look different no you see a little blurry a little blurry okay these are the ones i have that have that middle thing for the [ __ ] computer screen damn there we go that looks great man are those yours like you used to wear those prescription or what yeah these are my prescription glasses those are dope things definitely look sharper and cleaner and crisper but i can still see 20 20 with both eyes open as long as i have both eyes open it's just my right eye is bad so i usually don't wear them my left eyes i have stigmatism in both the left one's worse than the right but more than anything i can't see dick up close anymore without these things yeah you can't see dicks up close anymore that's funny man i said that that's funny uh what's up monk yeah have you had any problems with the switch over time charlie charlie is asking i don't think you have what's it what's it what's uh what he choo-choo charlie is asking if you've had any problems with your switch over time no um i've used this one the most i've used it this is the one i've used all year long on this show right here for the most part since i got it i don't know but no i haven't any problems with any of them i got three of them a beta and then two productions and this is my newer production it works great no that's what i love about it man i mean technology is is new but this one's pretty pretty [ __ ] durable man like yeah a whole lot in that physically that's gonna go wrong uh my mine had an issue but i'm reluctant to call it an issue i was using it to heat up a dynavap repeatedly you're the reason they tell people not to do that because i asked them and they said please don't i said oh okay i didn't know uh you had you would forge that that that road already [ __ ] far out yep that was me that was me nice it was it did it worked it did it did i did it a bunch of times until it didn't and when it didn't it like the whole thing like stopped working did they get it back and look at it or you still have it yeah i sent it back to them and so they could figure it out you have any idea what you broke uh no and when i when i talked to like their lead engineer induction like guy like the real induction guy like you know what i'm talking about like i i even told him about it and he's like huh he's like he's like it must have it must have triggered something and and [ __ ] up the programming and it just caused the whole thing just to [ __ ] itself i'm like okay yeah he's like because they you can't break it physically like i know i know i know i can't break it physically that's why i [ __ ] did it that's why i'm like i don't give a [ __ ] i can put a knife in here you know i can't break it physically i mean i could if i you know you know you would be the way to break the software too it would be you right you know what i mean right you're the you're the software breaker man that's awesome and i didn't even have to hook up my usb cord to it this time yeah you did that before maybe dr dabber switch versus poco peak pro that's a good video i need to get a new puffco peak pro atomizer i do i do actually i should republish my puffco peak pro video that'll be one of my i don't know man the puffco peak pro fixed a lot fixed a lot so i don't know yeah you are using the switch just pulled it out today uh i've been using that boost evo in the peak pro last few weeks and uh the occasional one of these things i really like taking this with me when i go play some madness things parade but anyhow yeah so this tonight and uh it beat the hell out of both of us man like she said the same thing she's like damn and then uh i came on here and here i am going down so damn damn damn it's in my head man like i can feel it in my skull it's like moving around that touch feels so good that's hilarious [ __ ] a jerry yeah i want to clean up this lobby seconds in this bowl i like the boost evo i've been using a lot man you have any more [ __ ] you want to talk about from your childhood no dr david boost evo it's a neat little device it's not very powerful but it's powerful enough for most people i think it's just not powerful enough for me what do you mean by powerful like the individual hits or the uh battery or what do you mean yeah i find like i i load a dab and i hit it you know for the duration of its thing you know like i get like like four hits off it and then i fire it up again and i get like three more hits and then it tastes like [ __ ] and then i q tip it out but those seven inhalations are never the equivalent to the satisfaction and the impact that i get from the exact same dab loaded into a quartz banger with the rio that's that's what i'm saying what about compared to some lauren's class like a peak pig pro vista mini i think the peak pro still uh out out now delivers the evo uh and the regular peak the aura hit would hit harder the cardo would hit harder i i think it hits a little soft it's more of a oil vaporizer less of a dab rig we like peak pro better than everything that we had here when it got here and the evo we felt like it was a little little we know if it's more potent or stronger or what but all i knew is what usually took her three hits only took her two and she wanted to pass it to me and then same with me i could barely finish it um i think part of it is that design where it just goes straight on up into the glass no sidewinding burns over silicone i love that design yeah so i i the potential is there to get all of your dab but now i have a whole lot of little glob swimmies you know little glob glob blobs that sit there and then the dab globs in there what do you call them troy what do you call those little dab gloves at floaties in the in the bong the dab the floaty dab gloves i don't have an official name for them like reclaimed dingleberries i just said floaty glob i i i rinse them out and i don't salvage them they're trash to me all right well i get more of those with the evo than anything else and i think it's because more [ __ ] there's nothing for else for it to catch on to so yeah i would i would but so i i think as far as an e-rig goes that evo is pretty good man as far as potency it does it does it for us the peak pro i like obviously i like this switch you got the rio that does it for you none of these are in that class you know what i mean so that's a to me that's just a different class all together you know i need to tame that beast i've only used it a few times and i tend to have a hard time getting it right where i want but every time every time you're there to tell me how to try and nail it so um i i need to get better at that talking about the reel and it's not the rio's fault i just need to practice a couple more times because you come at it you come out of it from a torch banger guy and you know what you're doing i come at it from i don't use torch bangers i'll use an email where i know it's at the whole time i'll use a portable email or something but or an e-rig but i don't i don't i was not a torch dabber guy just gave me an idea yeah yep thanks sorry uh please continue i was done yeah no that was it man i got you i'm back to you thanks jerry ah that's all i actually had i i wanted to send it out i don't want to have another dab right now i just wanted to get my rio nice and ready for the sesh wait for the after sesh tonight well i don't need another dab that's clear yeah i'm [ __ ] baked i'm also worried that if i if i have another coughing fit that i'll accidentally pee my pants because i gotta pee i had to pee for a while and i don't wanna i don't wanna like cough pee my pants yeah i'm wearing pants so who cares i'm totally wearing pants you'll just you know squirt the floor a little bit what you'll just pee on the floor a little bit ah you know i dropped my my bong the other day like this my fat bag i knocked it off my desk while rushing out of the room to take a piss because i i was like in the session and i was waiting for an opportunity to say i was gonna leave and like people wouldn't stop talking and i almost peed my pants because i was high and i got ocd like that you know i'm a polite person jerry shut the [ __ ] up so when i finally got the opportunity to like like say like hey i gotta go i'm gonna go gotta go pee and i left the session and i went rushing out of the room i knocked it off my my desk here and it didn't break it didn't break my my thought is that maybe it landed on the mouthpiece and and the mouthpiece gave it like a little like like a little cartwheel action and then its next bounce was like on carpet you know was was on the base and then it just like tumbled and rolled sideways you know it took a skateboarder or a gymnast would you know they don't they don't fall under their hands and try to stop themselves they roll into it you know and i think i think i think my bong knows how to fall and it rolled into it and it survived it survived from from my desktop surface it's round oh no that's great i'm surprised he didn't break anything man what did it hit is it carpet is carpet out there it's technically concrete but there's a rug on top of it there's like a shag rug right okay so barely yeah still hard underneath yeah i show the shakes that's funny man well man that's hilarious dude no i was i was thinking about this time um my wife and i were watching this kid for a few minutes before we went to school with our kids and uh he came over and he was playing video games and he was only hanging out for i don't know it wasn't long 15 20 minutes anyhow point is he was like you he had to pee when he got there he started playing and he couldn't he he i walked in the room and he was literally couldn't decide whether to hold the controller or because he just couldn't he had to pinch himself yeah and i was like dude there's bathroom just right down the hall i mean go go and he literally like uh-huh and he and he dropped the controller and ran there and he didn't make it that's totally me as a kid and i'm like dude you're you're gonna wet the floor and i not showed up and instead he had wet himself it was just i couldn't believe i i've never actually witnessed that before it was hilarious man i just and then you know he couldn't go to school work with that you know luckily he lived right down the street so we could send him home and get cleaned up but that was hilarious man i was like yeah yeah have you been there i've had i've had some incidents even as an adult jerry even as an adult just getting so focused you just don't go to me and i well you know i'm a night person yeah so sometimes when i when i stay up all night and i'm forced to be awake early morning for daytime things my solution is to drink a bunch of mountain dew or whatever you know a bunch of caffeine which makes me piss yeah so like one time like my wife and my mother-in-law was here from the philippines and we were going to like navy pier so we we drove to chicago and it was like a three-hour trip and i drank like a big slam mountain dew on the way there and by the time by the time we got to the parking garage in navy pier i had to [ __ ] piss and i'm not talking like i gotta pee i'm talking like the urges were were getting severe and i was driving a wrx like a subaru wrx like turbo and we're we're going we're going up the the ramp because the parking garage is full and i'm driving this stick shift you know this [ __ ] fast-ass car and we're going like up and like we're on like the fifth floor and like trying to drive the stick shift and i as we're creeping around the the sixth floor i look and i see that the the exit row like the downhill side is now empty like now there's parking spots over there like i i see like oh [ __ ] i can cheat now and and park over there and i also don't want to piss my pants jerry but my wife is next to me my two kids are in the back seat and my mother-in-law is sitting right behind me oh it's one of those moments so as we come around the corner i throw the clutch and i throw the throw in gear and i light all four tires up and just like like the car is like squealing going around this curve and i whip it around and i pull into this parking spot and i i run out and i think i'm completely safe i think i'm like in in my mind i just pulled into an empty parking parking lot and i parked by a truck and i ran out to the to the trunk of my car and
