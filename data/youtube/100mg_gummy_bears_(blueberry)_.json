{"MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll

"vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "JkSDcNwhijk": "[Music] yeah

little bit of a hint taste of cannabis you do taste I'm sorry looking both places you do taste the cannabis in this it's not really like strong overwhelming where it's like gross like a cushy punch cuz she put just tastes disgusting this doesn't taste nice like a cushy punch but it does have cannabis flavor in there along with the apricot and it tastes pretty good just one just want to let you

make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast

the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from

superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "izWDdT2XfP4": "[Music] welcome back to the edible kenzie show i'm edible kenzie and today we'll be reviewing infused cannabis infused gummy blueberry okay so get your weed get comfy and let's get started so good so good usually on my channel i'll test out an edible about 25 milligrams which is typically my threshold and then if it's not up to snuff i'll take the rest of it but today we just have a little sampler pack well little taste here which i love i love sample packs they're always so cute and it's only 10 milligrams i haven't had any weed substances today yet so i feel like i'll be okay i feel like this might tickle my threshold if it's up to snow if it's up to snuff i got this from kushagram delivery and they were on sale it was only two dollars so you know a girl had to cop it i love it i love the little sampler pack i think it's so smart because sometimes you want to test out an edible without fully committing so i just it's so cute i'm excited the company that makes this is infused and fused makes a lot of thc and cbd infused gummies um they're also known for their inhalers but i'm not trying that today i will try that eventually i'm excited about that but today we're just trying the little sampler blueberry gummy all of their gummies are made with a thc distillate and that's how they get their edibleness okay ingredients glucose syrup sugar glucose powder food additive and then parentheses gelatin acid treated starch d sorbitol solution citric acid dl malic acid ditarteric acid blue want chc distillate artificial food flavor okay i don't know what a lot of those things are but i'm sure they're delicious okay now it's time to taste it oh in honor of the blueberry i even wore my blue sweatshirt shout out pop-up james for the sweatshirt he was also a dentist [Music] so this doesn't have like a tear open thing so i'm gonna go tear it open with some sizzles because if i use my teeth i know my pop-up's gonna be rolling over and it's great snip snap we got that i'm looking in it you see that it's got little sugar crystals on it it doesn't say oh i'm stupid it does say it says it's a sour gummy i was upset i hope it's not sweet with crystals yum i have a feeling i'm gonna like this but you know we'll see bam check that out check that out damn damn yes please and thank you ma'am okay we like that that's a beautiful blue green it looks like avatar it's like a nice squishy gummy it's a gummy that bounces back you know what i mean it's not too gelatinous oh my gosh oh my gosh i love the sour crystals on it but that's probably just citric acid right let's give this a taste okay [Music] i'm trying to keep it keep the flavor in my mouth mouth feel exquisite okay was it sour for blueberry maybe but not really maybe to a less mature palette but to me not really it was just kind of like blueberry with like the tiniest bit of tart ness was it good the texture of the gummy had the same yeah it had the same kind of texture as a trolley gummy that was good i don't usually like opt for blueberry gummies but if i would opt for one that would definitely be it you don't taste the weed i got like like like a millisecond a millisecond of weed after the fact and it wasn't like a bad weak taste and it was just like gone in a second it was a nice little sampler i kind of want another one but you know it's just a sample bag but now i'm going to i'm going to wait i'm going to shave my legs and yeah see if it kicks in once again always you know do some sort of physical activity don't take an edible and then lay out on the couch because then when you get up that edible's gonna fat hit you this said it's about a two hour activation time before you take another edible sometimes gummies take a little bit longer to kick in we're going to time it out see how long it takes to kick it if it kicks in at all we'll be right back after this length shaven break [Music] that was a cute little devil [Music] ignore the stain it's not a stain i got naira on my sweatshirt so i'm just waiting for it to wash off the legs the legs though good it's two hours after the fact i knew that i would have to think about whether i'm feeling it or not check back in with myself um after the fact because it is less than half of what i usually would take to know that an edible is true to milligram but two hours later only 10 milligrams i i can tell my body is more relaxed you know it's there it's not a dosage that is tailored for me but for somebody else at 10 milligrams is your threshold you don't feel this it did take my threshold so i will mark it as true to milligram for the gummies i thought it tasted really good blueberries not your flavor they've got an array of flavors okay you can find what's good for you i thought it was a really really good gummy i thought it was yummy if i were to pick a flavor i would probably not pick blueberry just because it's not for me okay but flavor-wise i thought it was like it was really good for a gummy it's like what you expect and it didn't have that kind of burnt weed taste that sometimes edibles do have you couldn't taste the weed at all to be honest this edible would be really good for people that don't want to taste weed i don't know how good it would be for somebody who wants to get smacked in the face by an edible because it's a very responsible dosage [Music] responsible so if you're looking for an edible with high milligram and like low amount of food this won't be for you but this is a very reasonable edible it tasted good i could see myself eating more if i needed to it wasn't too it wasn't too rich it was really good it was delicious i really i loved the packaging because it was like a little sample size you know just for people that want to try it they don't want to commit i just want to give it a little little taste it wasn't resealable but since it's a sample thing i'll let that slide i'm sure on their bigger things they're usually syllable flavor-wise i would give it one and a half out of two need leaves packaging i would give it one out of one absolutely and for trunus to mg i would definitely put two out of two so i'm reading this edible four and a half weed leaves out of five wheat leaves just because you know the flavor was there don't get me wrong the taste was great but was it like five stars you know not for me just not for me okay that's okay it would be great to get like multiple flavors as a gift it would be a great little stocking stuffer i don't know if you know how old your kids are but you know i would love to get that in my stocking mom if you're watching this but overall i give it four and a half out of five bead leaves thanks for watching my show my name is eda mckenzie and join me next time when i'll review a different edible i don't know what yet you know but it'll be something until then stay high so good so good so good even though it just very lightly tickled my threshold i probably shouldn't have done that why did i do that um", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you

expertise um with cannabis being legal in um chicagoland area and and growing to the rest of the united states there's so many emerging players in this market today that we want to not really know what's going on so um we're reviewing the new terabytes today from kiva confections these are the chocolate covered blueberries i got them at new era dispensary down the street on north avenue in chicago check them out for you know your next your next run um but these actually these costs about 40 20 of these come in the 10 and they're 5 milligrams of thc each we're going to give it a taste and come back and see what effect it has so first glances here you can see that all the chocolate covered blueberries are in there um not a bad size not a bad size you know i'm looking for something that tastes good right but um [Music] we're gonna we're gonna see how this goes so let's let's give it a taste [Music] so first initial thoughts really chocolatey um nice and soft too um really good blueberry field blueberry sorry can you top really good blueberry taste as well um overall one of the top tasting edibles i've had and i've had a lot of edibles recently with it being legal in chicagoland area so not bad not bad um so we're gonna wait about an hour and come back and and see how i feel um because you know sometimes i've had 5 milligrams of thc you know i'm gone and then other times i can't feel things so we're going to see how i feel when we get back what's up guys so it's been about 55 minutes since we've taken the five milligram thc edible now again i i take it about i take i take edibles you know almost every day so it's different effect on me depending on the day it's been a while since i've had an edible but yeah this is giving me pretty high feeling it's uh it's hard to explain obviously but uh yeah good a good effect i would definitely recommend uh this is and now i'm gonna go watch some some movies or something but yeah take care", "0g1Gn7OQk20": "[Music] okay guys we are doing the flourish gummies in the cub watermelon 100 milligrams of THC already how one of these had to he's kind of funny they're not delicious in my hair supposed to be in a bun but it's not delicious and good like the Caminos I kind of real strong marijuana taste to it really strong they don't taste like delicious but we're gonna seem to get a sign sir we're going to see if it gets as high so I'll be back about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it

getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "8z5bUfY2fJ4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "eSw1S_tEOLo": "what's up YouTube it's a boy stuff we preview Channel Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "9EUFCgxEVYs": "[Music] hey everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com back with another west coast we tour review 2020 edition today super excited because man i visited steezy downtown la the other day picked up a nice group of items these little assorted bits beets i'm not sure 20 pieces a bunch of different colors bunch of different flavors i'm super excited hundred milligrams in this container are you guys ready it says low calorie gluten free let's see what else what else what else 4.78 milligrams of serving this package actually only has 95.54 milligrams of thc so always read the packaging because you're not actually getting a hundred it says total 100 milligrams on the front on the sticker 95 milligrams dhc take a view of the colors of these gummies i'm pretty excited got the green pink orange blue purple red look got a bunch of these here look at that red one oh almost dropped it so you know an assorted colors here super excited let's check it out one i'm gonna eat two of these today one bite i'll talk about the first one two bites we'll give it the official score you guys know what's good and the rules here we go first one what color should we go with chris what do you think purple i like your style i'm a grape guy so this is perfect this is a great way to start i'm really judgy about grape flavored [ __ ] it's really it's really sticky like it tastes good it's light it's not a great flavor at all unfortunately i don't know what flavor it is but it's really sticky it's slightly sweet it's berry something i don't know if it's grape does it say can just say what the flavors are peel here let's see let me see if let me see if there's something here peel here ah here we go here we go here we go here we go oh yep it has the flavors oh it's not grape it's black cherry interesting okay so the flavors black cherry orange green apple strawberry watermelon and blue raspberry cool now that i know that just ate the black cherry that was pretty good it's a sour black cherry against your sour so it was slightly sour all right that makes sense way more sense second color blind taste test don't tell me don't tell me what i get all right now you guys see here we go what'd i get chris i can't tell you oh all right so i have no clue what [Music] strawberry okay hmm all right so very chewy it's stuck in my tooth it makes me think of the consistency between like the dots times starbursts and chewiness and like stickiness and like how you have to get it off your teeth it takes like some effort but also there is a very much like a uh uh what is it the uh sour patch kids yes there's a very much a sour patch kid aspect to this it's not quite sweet enough i can't give them that these are slight these are definitely tart i wouldn't say they're sour though at least for the black cherry and the strawberry uh those two again let me see do these they don't really have individual smells let me see what we got here presentation beautiful front label sticker there that was in the top of the lid i love it they've got the warning labels on it all appeal you know i gotta say the steezy does a great job of presentation i'm going to give these a solid 10 out of 10 appeal um sour gummy cubes i'll give it a 9.5 there's nothing that makes me feel like this is healthy whatsoever um color super wonderful branding the colors of the gummies are all super on point like i feel like that's all good 10 out of 10 smell definitely don't get me if these gummies had individual smells with each of the gummies i'd give it a perfect score but they don't and because of that that's ah man to me that's like a 7.5 on the score because there's just no smell to this jar whatsoever so it's just smells like sweet candy although that's what candy should smell like that's why they get a the 75 because it's like okay cool they get the candy smell right like that's it but like i really needed like five different flavors of stuff uh potency let's see uh total of 100 milligrams thc but this pack specifically only had 95.54 a little disappointing right but to be expected right it's hard to get this 100 dialed in if that's not your model so it's tough um potency i gotta give you guys you know it's not a hundred milligrams it's five milligrams less i'm going to give you guys an eight out of ten that's kind of hurting there taste i did like the black cherry i thought the strawberry made sense afterwards it was nice and light and kind of tart uh taste uh uh you know to read the full to get the full taste score i'll have to eat a few more of these and then make sure you guys check back into the written review or in the description that'll kind of help that but for now i'll give it a give it a i'll give it a 7.5 out of 10. um not not that sour and not a very strong flavor that made me know exactly what it was if that was grape would have been hyped but it wasn't um purple usually goes with a grape flavor let's see let's see let's see experience experience so far is around a 7.5 to an eight out of ten again i wish there would have been a smell i wish there would have been greater flavors kind of hard to identify what all the flavors are unless you peel the sticker off i was always bad at reading directions i assume lots of other people are makes it going to be tough for them to figure out what these flavors actually are so in my experience i'll give it a i'll give it an 8 out of 10. more information there is a lot of information on there i notice again steezy does a great job of uh you know educating and teaching and they're good with pads and vendor days that they stop all out of their stores so i give it to them for that it's tough i'll give them i give them the information was there it was peelable i'll give them a nine i'll give them a nine out of ten what i recommend i would recommend probably some other different versions of these gummies i've had better ones than these from them but i definitely would recommend this 8 out of 10 solid recommendation the only time i would recommend switching away from this is if there's a specific flavor you want or if you feel like price point it's kind of that kind of choice for you or you know maybe get a better deal so that uh overall i'm going to give them an 8.5 out of 10 but we'll cut we'll also see what our slider method kind of aggregates it to once we enter in all the exact scores so stay tuned i appreciate you guys for all the love we've got the steezy bits here 20 assorted flavors a lot of good ones a nice sour candy look at all these cool colors that we've got here um i love the experience man stevie you guys do a great job i look forward to doing some more work with you all please stay tuned for more reviews facebook instagram twitter linkedin youtube man we're all over the place respect my region here with the west coast we tour shout out to chris for filming everything it's a long day of work stay tuned for more content love you guys [Music] peace [Music] do [Music] you", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "ZLpZxkFB2-8": "[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats

that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [ __ ] slated piece the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin we in a jungle smokin", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "gvzv07w2RY0": "[Music] welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy jack reviewing the Camino gummies here the wild berry indica five milligrams a pop I've already enjoyed I think let's see how much I got left one two three four five six seven eight eight left it's 40 milligrams I have enjoyed 60 milligrams and I've taken those at night this is a nice indica helped me to sleep let's see I think the first time no each time I had six for my head seven either way I've taken 25 to 35 milligrams and I feel it's consistent it's good I do recommend the Camino I recommend all Cuba products they deliver potencies their flavor is phenomenal they do that they nail that however when I buy again personally we're good look at this that's a fair amount of gummies one two three four five six seven eight here a lot at eight oh yeah I think I did actually anyway that's a fair amount of gummies to eat but that being said everybody's tolerance is a little different you know my tolerance is less than some more than others I know people who can eat a lot more edibles than me I know people that if they had half to a quarter of this they would get late and probably fall asleep so with all these edible reviews this isn't me talking my experience is how much I take what works for me the most important thing you can do for yourself is experimentally but you know take a couple see if it works that's what I did at first now I know my sweet spot is like 20 to 30 ish depending what I'm doing if I just want a nice little kick nice little feel calm down I have to but right now I'm go for two for five that's thirty milligrams of delicious wildberry indica it reminds me of those Welsh's fruit snacks the wild berry ones I don't know if you've had those flavor is really good I really like their packaging too on this one especially got like a pink Scott pink outdoors got like water running trees it's supposed to transport you to what did I say California state of mind overall five stars because it's a legit product but personally I don't know if I'll buy again just because I have other edibles I like a little more nothing against them I'm definitely gonna get the sativa however I think it's like a pineapple habanero something like that maybe the mango habanero something with some spice in there which I'm excited to try because I love spice I love mixing sweet and spice but I'm going too long here I'm gonna come back to you in about an hour and a half talk to you when uh these indicus kicked in I will label Oh get ready for bed and I'll see you guys okay so I'm gonna be completely transparent here with you I didn't take six of these last night lay down with my girl watch black mirror if you haven't seen that show it's pretty badass anyway I've even finished the episode and I knocked out after six of these it was like a 15 hour work dad maybe that play part in it but like I said the previous two times I've had the you know 25 to 30 it did the trick it mellowed me out i chilled for a while the hay woke up ready to get it feeling great today got a couple truebloods meetings one for the true buds tank top I am excited about and then another one with a local cannabis company and I don't want to save their name because we haven't really committed to anything but should have some fun videos coming through that soon I'll catch you guys on the next one I do give this five stars I do highly recommend it and maybe pass out got Java that's what I want with an indica especially if I'm eating it late at night like Sam I get ready for bed I didn't think I was actually gonna fall asleep and go to bed but it happened it happens when I take it to you I'll stay up I'll make sure to stay up and give you a full review on that one yeah camino a wild berries and i like how for the effect it says chill I feel that the Camino truly encompasses that chill factor just like you it's actually turning in I'll see you on the next one coming at you yeah this is worse than Mary Jane I we ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiast talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session hey yeah true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it and the cutter sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed", "BwSxDovwTvg": "oh gosh I'm watching you cut me out of weird time so good to see you though welcome to wheats everybody goalie I'm so glad you are here gosh welcome to wheats you sons-of-bitches the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and oh boy am I excited today because Kiva one of my all-time favorite edible companies is getting on them the gummy game and anytime Kiva makes a new product I am excited as hell to give it a try so that's right guys we are reviewing a Kiva Camino cannabis infused gummies they are flavor profile is dark and juicy and the effect is chill let's read the [ __ ] on the back inspired by the diverse landscapes of our wild and wonderful state let Camino transport you to a California state of mind our wild berry gummies pear calming indicator beans with notes of wild blackberry and fresh raspberries for a laid-back weekend vibe take a stroll through California's Pacific Northwest and relax a while so there are twenty gummies in here five milligrams each pretty standard affair for it the new edibles here in California with the new laws and you've got everything you want to see on it there are test results ingredients batch numbers all of that fun wonderful stuff and it comes in a beautiful package because it's Kiba keep it makes great packaging and it's not even that ostentatious there's not a whole lot you have to dig through or throw away it's just a bag but it looks really nice because it's keyed up and they make a nice packaging well let's shut up about how nice kiba's packaging is and talk about how good their gummies taste finger crossed and how high they're gonna give us double fingers cross if you're a long time wheats viewer you know that I love me my Kiva their chocolate I think it's maybe the second best edible chocolate out there behind defaults a delicious in potent AF that's a spot for that you see we don't know yeah I got open the child resistant packaging all by myself I'm a big big boy let's give it a sniff whoa smells good so there are our gummies in the bag let's take a couple of them out here they're a little bigger than I would have guessed much bigger than the plus size yummiest so here we are here are our Kamino Keva wild berry gummies a little cannabis e flavor but very fruity holy crap wow that is the best tasting canvas gonna be I've ever had it's so good it's so sweet it's so sweet it tastes like mmm god damn Kiba I'm legitimately not joking that's one of the best gummy candies I've ever eaten edible or otherwise holy [ __ ] [ __ ] Kiva man oh my god it's so sweet Wow mmm I'm not dreading I need all 20 of those gummies I'm dreading having the bag empty to be honest that is not hyperbole those are delicious those are delicious gummies but as we know we're gonna have to cross those fingers because gummies can be a little all over the map I found them to be getting better now that we're illegal world so I've got high hopes for these chemo gummies but like all our reviews guys I'm gonna eat all 20 of these sons of [ __ ] and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how these Kiva Comino are landing because that's what you're really in it for it so guys wish me luck I'm gonna enjoy eating this back and I will see you back here in about two hours thanks for watching wheats [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the Camino the Kiva Camino cannabis infused gummies and we're really going with that cannabis infused gummies named with all these companies aren't weight cannabis infused that is and this seeming to be the new enclosure du jour for all gummies going forward uh first and foremost these are the best tasting gummies I've ever had edible gummies for sure possibly even just normal gummy candies these are excellent uh and they are pretty damn good too um I'd say they're maybe not quite as strong as the plus gummies that I've reviewed a couple of which I really really liked but these are not far behind at all and they taste so much better than the plus gummies which don't taste bad to begin with it's just that Keva they have some witchcraft they they have some witchcraft and they can keep that nasty cannabis taste at bay nothing all cannabis taste is nasty but it's usually really gross in the gummies but not here and so it's still pretty potent today got up to about a six or so for a hundred milligram edible not too bad not too bad at all so I definitely enjoyed my first experience with kiba's and Kamino line and I yeah maybe three or four flavors and I look forward to reviewing them all because my boys at Kaiba dog and that guys is gonna do it for this review really positive here so anytime we have one of those positive reviews we like to put a little cherry on top a little some extra that you can enjoy throughout your week that isn't necessarily weed related doesn't need weed to help you enjoy it on this week it's something a little bit different I don't often endorse food but this one is such a good deal that I thought I had to give it a shoutout and that is imitation gruel not so not real gruel real gruel is you know it's it's okay but you pay extra for it the imitation gruel is amazing it's got a very sludgy texture a kind of would you describe it as kind of an earthy may be a dirty taste a dirt dirt a posture or dirt - white kind of tastes you know it's it's great um and according to Krusty the Klown nine out of ten orphans can't tell the difference so we are talking Kiva wildberry Caminos super thumbs up and imitation gruel Krusty the Klown says nine out of ten orphans cannot tell the difference and this guy totally agrees imitation gruel check it out I don't think you can actually find it it's from The Simpsons so maybe that's what my actual cherry on top is The Simpsons the good Simpsons not the bad Simpsons so season 9 and then stop Wow that went a long ways for that but I appreciate you guys watching thanks you guys are wonderful just such good guests and wonderful conversationalist so we feel like we have a real dialogue here you and I the audience so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I will see you on the next review I don't know why I said that so inquisitively goodbye this is taking forever goodbye", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "LbDVvYE64Bk": "[Music] glory be friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and look at this little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace No hello and thank you so much for watching weeds

try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "4PktvUEGyT0": "yo what is up everybody it's a good day to smoke today welcome to the sesh everybody thank you for clicking on my video i hope you drop a like if you did enjoy it i believe that's all let's get into some [ __ ] so after i got out of work today i went and stopped by a dispensary canna rx we got a few things so let me go through this and then we'll get to smoking don't you worry so first thing i got i'm gonna try out for you guys we got a um froot loops medicated cereal bar bro this [ __ ] looks good well i've actually had them before so i know they are good but yeah as you guys can see you got a hundred milligrams in that so that'll be good i'm gonna eat that and i'm gonna cut the video after i'm done smoking and i'm gonna come back later and you know we'll see how baked i am after this and smoking some weed free pre-roll came with the purchase let's look at that damn y'all looking pretty good last thing i grabbed this wasn't actually i didn't get this today i got this yesterday or the day before that but i got some batter this is some caramel candy kush but i've smoked a little bit of this uh we're gonna hit it out of my um nectar collector thing but yeah as you guys would you look at this it almost looks like caramel but um yeah it's some some gassy stuff it smells so damn good yeah i uh i recently got some diamonds i actually want to show you guys some diamonds sometime soon uh i meant to make a video on it the only thing is that i think i want to get a new uh rig or maybe even a puffco or peak peak puffco um because those are so much easier like when you have diamonds like they're just kind of like loose in this thing and it's so much easier to just like drop them in something like a banger or like a puffco um when i try hitting it with this it's so annoying like i'll try like you know try to like touch the rock with it and then it'll like suck the whole rock it'll like stick to the end and then you like get way too much or waste a bunch it's it's a little annoying so i got some batter this time just to be safe but you know it's some good [ __ ] still i forgot if you guys get pre-rolls it's a good idea to just kind of roll them in your hand not too rough but just uh you know gentle to like loosen up the weed make sure there's airflow because there's been plenty of times where i've gotten pre-rolls from dispensaries and they're just like packed airtight and they just sit there and smoke it's basically a wheat incent you're not getting anything it's a little annoying um y'all this is so good like there's nothing like working all day like an eight to like 10 hour long day and then you come home you haven't smoked it all that day and you just you spark up and it feels so damn good it's just um that explains the [ __ ] guys she's canoeing a little bit real quick for those of you who don't know how to fix canoes you know maybe best way to do it you know if you just want to smoke it you don't have a lighter keep hitting it but keep the paper side up so that the heat rises and burns that quicker hopefully um other way you know just light it a little light it from the underside i just kind of like even it out i mean you probably waste like a little bit of weed but it's it's worth kind of trying to get it back to like an even burn yeah i hope you guys are smoking with me drop in the comments how you're smoking you know smoking some dab some shatter blunt whatever the [ __ ] it is let me know because i'm curious and i want to know [Music] all right i'm gonna put that down for a second let's take a dab y'all let's get [ __ ] up this thing ain't doing it quick enough oh man that hit different i'm feeling good now that just like set me that set the pace for the rest of this video oh so yo the craziest [ __ ] happened this morning you guys little mini story here not like a big story it's not gonna be like the point of this video but on the way to work this morning so i got up right right well when my alarm went off i initially like woke up and it was one of those things where it was like man i just need to sleep for five more minutes just five more minutes i just i literally just closed my eyes closed my eyes for a second then like i woke up and i had to be to work in 10 minutes so you know like i got ready and [ __ ] super quick start bolting my ass over there and uh i live in maine for those of you who don't know but it's like uh in i'm in like a town not really a city so it's just a shitload of back roads everywhere so i'm taking back roads to work and on the way to work i come around this corner you know i think the road is like 40 or some [ __ ] i'm doing at least 60. just cruising and uh yeah i i so i see this cop right like i'm i'm going around the corner i see the cop my [ __ ] heart drops dude i just start like whenever i see a cop and like times that i have gotten a ticket before bro all this [ __ ] just like runs through my head in like a second like oh dude i'm gonna lose a bunch of money i'm gonna get a ticket i'm gonna lose my license i'm gonna like just like all this bad [ __ ] and then you know my heart drops and i look back he flashed his lights but he only flashed him for like a second or two and then i was just you know i was like oh [ __ ] so i don't know i don't know if he was warning me or if he was like doing that to signal like yo i'm stopping you but you know like i said i was on some back roads right so as i see him do that you know he takes a left into like some old uh car junkyard or maybe it was like a used car place a shitload of cars everywhere some of them were shitty some of them were like decent looking but he pulls in there and that was the last thing i see i go up over a hill and i'm just like [ __ ] [ __ ] like i'm already like running late to work and now i'm about to get pulled over and all this [ __ ] and oh [ __ ] i just dropped so after that like i break the [ __ ] ton and i like downshifted but after i went over that hill dude i started [ __ ] booking it dude i was shifting as fast as i could i was going going i think i was like 85 90 at this point like heading towards um the business that i work at and um bro i'm going i'm going i'm going i'm like just keep i keep checking in like my rear view every time like i'm about to go around the corner or something to make sure i don't see him and you know i'm just you know my heart's beating i'm [ __ ] it was wild but it felt like a hot pursuit and um you know i finally like i reached the my business is driving it's a landscaping company i landscape see i turn in there and you know i made it like i made it thank god you know and i was only like a minute or two late i don't think my boss was even there yet and uh yeah i was just i was freaking out like my hand was shaking like i just my heart was beating my adrenaline was [ __ ] going there

another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "ks2Cc1fykuE": "[Music] that wasn't that good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show will be help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is one I am particularly excited to share with you guys it is one of the most popular brands out there for edibles and that is cushy punch and today we are taking a look at their brand new flavor and now compliant with the new edible regulations here in California we are taking a look at their Private Reserve that's right it is a hybrid blend so this goes up there with their other hybrid they're indicated sativa and now they have a private reserve it is about one to two dollars more expensive depending on affability dispensary you can pick it up from and I am not sure what makes it Private Reserve I don't know what that even means maybe it's the fact that it's made with full-spectrum cannabis oil whatever that means or maybe the fact that it's not a food product means it's what it's a the Private Reserve I don't think so but we're gonna eat it the whole thing just like normal so this is as they say it is sixteen by sixteen 6.25 milligram doses which is compliant with the regulations and you can see on the back it's got all the information you want to see it shows the dosage ml 10 pieces wait 60 minutes ingredients nutrition facts and on the side here we've got gluten free dairy free fat free peanut free and non-gmo I was really hoping there was gonna be some gluten in there I'm a big guy peanuts can take I'm sorry if you do have a peanut allergy though I must make your life really [ __ ] so here we go here is the package on the inside like the old cushy punch it is divided and like the four squares but then they say you should divide those four squares into four squares of six point two five milligrams each I'm gonna guess nobody ever does that now I just have to figure out how to get this little foil little off here I don't see an open here anywhere oh I think I got it I think I got it guys just delicate easy and there we go oh yeah it is it is very easy to pull out twenty-five different little individual slices no it's not it's just one big glob yeah I'm sure somebody's gonna take the time to take a little knife and cut this up into twenty-five little squares and not do what I'm about to do right now and just plop this whole thing in my mouth actually I'm gonna eat about half of it right now and then plop the other half in in about half an hour come on out no come on daddy's hungry [Music] my camera person just laughed at me I'm gonna get fired for that nothing this is a paying job god damn all right we have our gummy it is for squares they're mean you can really taste the Private Reserve that actually does have I equal considerably less weed flavor than in the normal cushy there is a wee taste especially in the aftertaste it's not as strong as the other cookie punches it has a bit somewhat present like kind of fruity punch taste to it oh it's not bad it does again it does have a strong cannabis aftertaste but far from the worst in terms of gummies it's not pleasant but it's small enough and easy enough to chew down POC down that I'm not looking not dreading having to eat the whole thing so I'm gonna eat this other little half in probably about half an hour and I will see you guys two hours after that to let you know how this cushy punch ride that reserve is Landon thanks for watching wheats guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] johner matey [Music] yo jerks welcome back two weeks it's been about four hours since I checked in with you talking cannabis in ears cushy punch Private Reserve and it's only been four hours four not any particular reason largely just because I am lazy but I am happy to tell you that the cushy punch Private Reserve is at least as good as the normal cushy punch I'm not sure we declare it any better it seems to taste about the same maybe slightly better and I'm about as high as I am a hundred milligram cushy punch which is pretty good and high for a hundred milligram edible so I'm altum Utley quite pleased with this I picked it up for a cheaper price I believe only $12 which is a very cheap price I assume you're gonna have to pay if you're paying full price plus tax on this closer to 28 places and for that price I mean it's right in line with the other gummies it's probably worth it I'm not sure it's worth a premium over the normal cushy punch but if you're feeling fancy and you want to donate an extra dollar to the fine folks at cushy punch go for it I think I'll just stick with the regular ones from now on and that guys is gonna do it for this review thumbs up for me but before I go I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that can be enjoyed with or without weed something you could just watch and enjoy throughout your week and this one guys I do definitely definitely recommend that you have weed because you're probably not going to make it through without it and that is my favorite music video of all time and that is Corey Shores crying for America it's a bit hard to find I'm not gonna lie it's not easy son but I will be sure to include a link in the description so that you guys can check out this music video and feel inspired and maybe for the first time in three or four years believe in America I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it Wow again um this review is cushy punch Private Reserve it's pretty good but my cherry on top is [Music] I'm praying [Music] Cory you know what's gonna have trouble with this it's Cory shores crying for America and Wow Wow thanks for watching weeds guys we'll see on the next review", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "ztvQhTfAVgY": "hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you wonderful fine folks make sense of that crazy maybe now remote place you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "NqEVxYb8imo": "[Music] that's pretty good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a good old-fashioned classic because we were taking a look at edibles and a classic edible kind at that the cookie we're finally digging into big Pete's here I've heard actually a lot of really good thing about big Pete's so I am excited to give it a try but that's a lot of calories in here haha just look at the nutrition information [ __ ] um so this is the mini cookie model which seems to be the biggest model out there for edibles in California I'm gonna say pioneered by Korova I don't know if that's actually true um that's where I first saw the the first time used some to use that model was kirova so 10 cookies 10 milligrams of THC each because that is what the regulations are you can only have ten milligrams max per individual serving and then you can only have ten servings for a total of 100 milligrams for any legal edibles so this is a big heavy ass hunk in bag of cookies there's 700 calories in total we've got a really wonderful packaging here great information lab testing results right there on the back nutrition information ingredients dosing instructions everything we even have a little story there on the back which I won't bore you with I'm just gonna take a peek right right out of here now uh okay good for you big Pete not that interesting so uh if you've never tuned into ones before unfortunately I'm gonna eat this whole friggin bag of cookies um because that's the way we're our room edibles reviews work is I eat the whole product to review the whole product and let you know how I feel about it two hours after I finished the last one of these cookies really don't have to eat 100 calories worth of cookies right now but I do it for you guys so uh I actually figured out how to open the childproof baggy on this one goomy I'm learning smells in there ooh they smell really good actually they smell like really really good peanut butter cookies there is a little bit of cannabis odor but they smell great here we are we've got the little lattice work on the top for the peanut butter cookie it looks good god damn this is great there's maybe a little bit of canvas taste but this is a good peanut butter cookie it's a lot softer I mean it's not soft but it is a lot softer than the the other mini cookies there's ones have the more Chips Ahoy brittle II thing and this is a little brittle but it's suddenly a little chewier than the others and it's great it's got a great peanut butter flavor just the right amount of crunch whoops mmm well if I have to eat ten of these at least they taste pretty good right okay chewie on the taste front guys I can tell you these are great genuinely surprised I mean I've heard good things about him but that [ __ ] was unexpected how good that was um so big thumbs up there but really guys what we all want to know is anybody can go get a mazing bag of cookies for the 20 bucks with these costs you want to make sure that these [ __ ] expensive ass cookies are gonna get you really high and for that guys you look to stick around for just a second and I will be back to you guys Oh in about two hours or so after I finish off this whole bag see you then [Music] big Pete's welcome back to wheats guys it has been about two and a half hours since I first checked in with you and I am ready to check out because big Pete's is a big ol win and the potency column look at them eyeballs red as can be man I loved big Pete's guys the cookies tasted excellent this is on the top level of hundred milligram potencies I mean this is about as potent as it gets great packaging I mean look at this you know tons of information not and not terribly ostentatious do not feel like you're spending extra money on it big Pete's man this is a huge thumbs up I could not be more happy with this the only problem is I have not yet thought of a cherry on top so I have to sit here and think of one for a second cuz I can't leave you guys without a cherry on top with something this exciting right that would feel rude I got it I got it I got it I'm gonna share with you guys a novel that I share with a lot of people that I quite like that I think have good taste like you guys cuz I think you guys all have great excellent wonderful taste is the most successful book I've ever recommended to people in terms of like batting average of them loving it I met a hundred percent right now or a thousand batting a thousand try not to mix metaphors holy [ __ ] that's a lot of build-up for the book which is then we came to the end by Jonah no not Jonah Joshua Faris Joshua Faris I think that's his name if we're not I'm going to be embarrassed great novel it's a weird novel that's told in the first person plural meaning they say like we and us instead of I and him or her and it is about the dot-com collapse an office that's like an advertising firm for dot-com companies right at the end of the dot-com collapse it is hysterical is so funny it is very poignant and it is sort of has come around to being sort of relevant again today with the shape of the tech industry so again that was then we came to the end that was a really long cherry on top and I just plucked that one out the sky love that book love big Pete's and their indica cannabis infused peanut butter mini cookies 65 million thumbs up way up in the sky but-but-but-but boom guys oh love you big Pete's I'm not a crook oh I don't know what's going on I'll see you guys on the next review", "HIwES9pE_yY": "[Music] welcome to week everyone the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at a brand new brand we are looking at dedicated medicated we are looking at their Cinnamon Toast Crunch bar it's a pretty low-end edible it's only 100 milligrams of THC and it only cost $4 at my dispensary so I don't have a whole lot of I don't want about a lot of high hopes for this but I am willing to be surprised and I hope to be surprised so this as you can see here is basically a rice krispies treat but instead of Rice Krispies there cinnamon toast crunch and again pretty cheap looking packaging just like a shitty little sticker pasted on there and a little vacuum seal bag but again only four dollars and 100 milligrams of THC so without further ado let's open it up and give ourselves a little taste test here so if this your first time tuning in tomates everyone the way we do our reviews is I eat this bad boy up I don't eat the entire thing in front of you because it just takes too long but I you know sample it make sure it tastes good let you know how it tastes then I hop off the camera and I come back two hours later to let you guys know how I'm feeling after consuming the whole thing and we wrap up then okay so here we go here is the bar right here you can see all the cinnamon toast crunch the marshmallow fluff it's kind of light and gooey very true it mmm look my prediction guys is you know exactly how this is gonna taste um no we taste no real weed odor probably because it's such low potency but it tastes exactly like you expected it's gonna taste it tastes like the rice a homemade rice krispies treat but with cinnamon toast crunch so otherwise pretty good or excuse me in other words that's pretty good and at least it is to me but we know the most important thing is not how it tastes but rather how it makes you feel and for that I'm gonna have to finish this off and I'm gonna have to come back to you guys two hours from now and let you know how we're feeling then so with that thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we'll check you back into two hours germs I am back it has been 2 hours since I've had the dedicated and medicated cinnamon toast crunch 100 milligram edible and I feel nothing literally nothing whatsoever not I can't say I'm too surprised knowing the price and the sort of shoddy craftsmanship involved but it's still a disappointment again this was only four dollars but still I was hoping for some kind of sensation but this could just be this particular edible or just this particular batch or whatever the case may be I do have some more dedicated medicated edible reviews on the way and I am certainly hoping for something a little bit more promising or a little bit more you know something will actually give me I but but maybe that's that's too much of a hope for a four dollar product again this was the dedicated medicated Cinnamon Toast Crunch 100 an\u00edbal total wet part of the product uh thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we will check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "S17ie9xoqGQ": "[Music] get back

our first trip out of Southern California and we are gonna look at some of the edibles here available in Colorado but first a mini rant Colorado I'm afraid in comparison to Southern California you do not hold a candle when it comes to edibles so for example I've got the Dutch girl caramel waffles I believe those are a stroopwafel this is a hundred milligrams of THC and it cost me $23 so roughly if you go milligram two dollar ratio about 300-400 percent more expensive than what you get in Southern California but I don't want to judge too harshly this also is Dutch girl stroopwafels promises to have feel it faster with n.ex.t technology whatever the hell that means they say nano extraction technology and that you fill these edibles faster than traditional edibles now if you guys have seen weeks before you know we traditionally do 30 60 120 pip updates not gonna be the case on these sweets vacation review I'm just gonna eat these bad boys come back to you guys in about two hours and let you know if we're feeling anything at all so here we go without further ado here is the product open up here and it's a little waffle cookie a little stroopwafel if you ever seen these German type cookies this is what they look like mmm smells delicious smells like a caramelized little Stroup cookie stroopwafel cookie but let's give it a taste no problems on the taste phone I apologize in that regard Colorado but for $23 is this gonna get me [ __ ] up I'll let you know guys in two hours thanks so much for watching we'll catch you back on weeds welcome back to wheats wheats on vacation here I'm back talking about the Dutch girl caramel waffles the stroopwafel it's been just a little bit over two hours and I just wanted to come back and tell you guys how we're feeling so for one hundred milligram edible I'm feeling a little high not especially high but for for something it's 100 milligrams probably right about on target but for the price I am not familiar with the Colorado market as well as I am the California market but I'm gonna guess that's probably right in the wheelhouse of an average price but these things are delicious so wheats on vacation if you find yourself in Colorado looking for an edible and you've got some money to spend and you like the way things taste you like your caramel waffles don't be afraid to pick up the Dutch girl it's good it's just not gonna put you in the hospital which is also good because you don't want to be in the hospital either but it's also not gonna put you in your bed so with that being said thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we'll check you guys on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "qfkAjOiETnQ": "[Music] hi and thank you for your interest in our full spectrum therapeutics this product is our Blue Dream 100 milligram full spectrum employed this oil is

that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "q4vWPMzOrNk": "[Music] hola mis amigos and welcome to meets the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review guys we are looking at a new brand something we've never looked at before a brand new product and that is the nut bar let's upside-down nut bar with this bizarre little like little emblem there looks like two upside-down sevens kind of so this is the 100 milligram nut bar cannabis infused a mocha crunch milk chocolate four squares that 25 milligrams each let's see on the back we've got our nutrition information all that good stuff URL boring ingredients and on the back they say at nug we cultivate and extract all our own cannabis to ensure only the finest quality is used in our product line should have read that better all of our products are tested for quality and potency by CW analytical laboratories in Oakland California always like to see that that's always a good thing to see that they are being tested by an independent body because you know some out there can be shady and not selling you exactly what is on the package as promised but these guys seem to be honest and on the up-and-up and I like the fact that all their weed is sourced in-house what do you think frog you like that they're weighted sourced in-house she's indifferent I don't know okay so I like the packaging on it it's got this fancy little pyramid shape or I guess more of a cigarette cigarette shaped thing with a little open here thing on this side so let's follow their advice and open it oh and then on the inside we've got highlights let's go ahead and read it because it's gonna you know it's gonna be overwrought and sort of eye rolling what to indulgences do people love more than chocolate and Phee cannabis oil was then folded into produce an infused chocolate bar with a flavor that will put you on your grind our nut milk chocolate bar is elevated to the next level with the addition of a balanced Bend blend of ground coffee beans the smoky essence of a dark roast paired with the crunchy texture only a slight rose can provide and a bi slight I mean light how do you take your coffee we prefer ours in an ugh mocha crunch bar okay fair enough that was pretty done we are the work hard play hard generation that's also I Rowley we've got our golden packaging here they like the fancy packaging which is good with me as long as they don't take away from the quality of the product okay so here we are here's our mocha crunch bar nug-nug and then those little seven looking things or however you want to pronounce those so uh guys I'm going to go ahead and eat this whole thing oh wow that definitely tastes like coffee good chocolate - quality chocolate if you're a fan of coffee flavored things you're probably gonna love this Wow I actually don't like the flavor of coffee as a beverage but I found that I really like coffee as a flavor um like mocha flavored things or you know espresso - flavored things and I don't I'm normally like a bitter super taster so it's weird all right well I'm gonna finish this off Pete the next couple of pieces and then I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling but for you it'll just be a couple of seconds and I'll be right back to let you know how we're feeling after this

line see how it was let's try it watermelon window vegan and there where'd you find that oh yeah yeah they're both vegan they're both being and their dairy-free how do you open this Oh locate two green lines locate tab and pull towards the side of the bad boy how do you open that how do you open it so easily leave that how did yours look like this oh wow it's like really it's like a booty song we kind of look like those son kids like with warm Sun yes you know green reminds me of the peach a movie they say bud Wow Wow that's really good fire they taste like those found like the sour patch kids on occasion they do softener I have had Wow he stays really good touch smokey these are probably some of the best gummies I have so blue if it focuses I don't even know ready all right well this is kind of like mid video so the last video got cut off because of me being stupid and putting this too close and then it didn't or the camera being stupid cuz it didn't focus back in on our pretty faces so it's actually the cameras fault not my fault but anyway so we're just hi I decided to do it in like better lighting and redo it a little bit so you can see it all better see our faces better but this is the Smoky's blackberry I found out that loud pack it's only made with loud pack in California if it's an Oregon or like some other places made with some other distributor so depending where you live changes who makes it kind of so I don't know that makes me wonder if it's like different quality do you want to rip it open do you want to do the honors that's terrible yeah they're like make it okay purplish I know I like it never goes back again thank you how many we having - okay this time we're gonna update all three you're gonna have for for which is it's a little of 40 milligrams 40 milligrams and then we'll update we're about to watch Hellraiser and then clean our cars so we're gonna clean our cars and watch how rays and we'll update you through the process but uh cheers guys [Music] they're so nice just even as a regular candies I'd eat them like even if these how many day - right they do kind of look like morning regatta maybe I'm having 80 milligrams you sure 80 calories are you sure you way late to film yeah I'm sure eighty calories of glycerin of corn syrup of corn syrup and dextrose do you think that's really good tell me ladies cool see what happens now let's go watch Hellraiser are we gonna duck couldn't cursors oh yeah well it's still light out painter cars I've been probably update turning Hellraiser update so it's been about what an hour-ish maybe about two hours two hours yeah how's the edible feel I feel productive I know I felt pretty like lit but productive I feel like so we cleaned the car and we cleaned the car we clean the living room we clean the bathroom I clean the player with the girl we went to eat well yeah but that was earlier by like since we took the edible and now we're about smoke but yeah I feel like pretty productive not tired like though so we're gonna smoke and anyway yeah we're probably gonna update after we watch how we raise or something so far so good so beautiful baby [Music] long as it then three hours I'd say it's been pretty productive three hours I made some dink so meal it's oatmeal art and inside this peanut butter and doing stuff and it's like layered but the outside is that they just look like candy Cantonese - yeah they do the packaging gon point that tastes at some point like if you saw this on the counter you know these yeah take these oh we should take these to the movies 30 milligrams does the temper better [Music] what would you recommend this oh yeah for sure ten Blake a lot of scale to one detail [Music] recommending this like never or would you recommend this like everyone who smokes weed probably at night yeah because some people can't handle it but if you can't handle it alone these are definitely not or even this everybody yeah see you there go yeah we'll be fine I unpacked some packs of these because the flavors you got terminal anyway good job Smokies good job lab pack a plus or at least an 8.5 co-host which is a very fine I give it I'm working anyway oh yeah I did [Music] so depending on the flavor but overall I think their flavors are really cool and they have a bunch of different options chances are out of all of their options they're gonna like at least one of the flavors yeah that's definitely a good beginner so yeah I'm just quite exciting [Music] so we're gonna take off we can go on a walk and I have a send rest of our day so you should have a Zen rest of your day to do and comment your favorite [Music] I guess why not just comment your favorite out of it we'll just call me whatever you like the most and the craziest terrible story or at least impact [Music] a lot of crazy yeah Meitner probably be when I took the 5150 me curls apart and ended up on a doom starving [Music] that was little curly things and it does that it was one of those for $20 you're getting a really high-quality edible the flavor and everything is on point well we'll see you about the effects I guess what I'm excited yay we should take these in movies though definitely yeah let's do it or at least before is no if we do is doing movies by the time the movie ends will just be stupidly just eating the whole pack of it yeah", "LGxMyTPPCDY": "[Music] hi guys welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at our second drink from the company that I just found out their actual name up I called them dozers in the past because there's the only labeling I saw was this little dozer guy right here I have no idea why it says dozers because the name of the drink is actually G drink by G pharma labs the same people who make the candy bars liquid gold the liquid gold candy bars same people make these make the drinks I didn't particularly like my dreams during class time but I've heard enough good things that I figured maybe I'd give you a second shot so this is a hundred milligram edible excuse me drinkable two servings hundred and ten calories per serving so 240 calories in this bottle it cost $12 as you can see there but I got it nine bucks so about what you would expect for a drink edible they're usually a little bit more expensive and edible but let's open it up here give it a taste and then I will come back to you guys after I drink it two hours is not good there's a very strong marijuana that astringent sort of acidic burning right at the top [Music] so I don't think it's as good as the Cannabis winter or be partly rape or excuse me the habit sparkling sodas but I'm gonna finish it and I will let you guys know how we're feeling in two hours because that's the most important part of the animal review so let's hope this it's us a little bit better than the G drink from last time and I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be two hours guys it has been two hours since I had the G drink pink lemonade hundred milligrams of THC and I apologize for the sort of construction going on behind me here doing a little bit of remodeling so I've got the closet covered down so I'm sorry that you guys can't see our fancy star system that's will be back there and I apologize that you're seeing all the mess that's back there as well but you know wall do one thing that I'm not happy to deal with is how unhide I am yeah this G drink is a total total bust just like the other G drink I had before I really don't feel anything at all and it tasted terrible so this is a this is a total bust for me again I can't say I feel high in the slightest and again and it was just the most awful taste going down the worst drink I think I've tasted so far and so yeah even though and it's it's not super cheap at $12 for the for the drink I think I'm gonna I would have to give a hard pass to the G drinks I do have one of their higher potency drinks to review think it's 210 milligrams so we'll see we'll give them another chance on that one to see if maybe they can turn things around but for right now I would tell you guys to avoid the G drinks if you're looking for a drink go with the cannabis quenchers like there's a lot and we'll definitely get you high these here so far the two I've reviewed major duds from me well guys that is going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on our next review peace", "tXMt1Q1-YLc": "these rolled up to Lamar you so if I buy it going on one of my late night but I got souffle fleet they put it on spin move that we go be like s adaboost so without further ado it's a close-up hi Bert Club and get some little bird emojis flap in the comment section taking a look at base edibles they look at these dank gummies and these have 802 THC content of 500 milligrams for this entire package now each dose is about 3 pieces and that gives you about 50 milligrams of THC now eaten well ingesting cannabis is blade different than smoking it when your liver has to process it it gives you a way different hide then when you inhale it's a total body high where I'm smoking it gives you basically just a head um docena says that the appropriate dosage for these is different for each person and been conditioned so freebo taking these willy-nilly make sure that your you know how much they take for whatever problem you're taking them for if you're just using them recreationally still use caution when using or consuming these won't get take a look at some of these out the pack so let's get somebody's out this pack I got over here these are the gummies look like you can see inside here they have a blue one right here I see a blue one in this pack so there's no not really telling what colors you're gonna get um they're coated with like a looks to be like a sugary thing they're pretty soft like they're room temperature so there Gummy's guess if you froze on these stiffen up a lot I'm going to guess we'll eat the green one why not eat the green one and see what that tastes like so just pop this thing I see how we do I burped about to take one of these dank gummies now I have already took one earlier and I can feel fill it slightly I've been smoking all day but it's a very different kind of feeling and it's more of a relaxing feeling I will probably go to sleep right now sleep all night wanna try this bring window you know hopefully it'll uh increased my abilities sleeping Mike I don't typically sleep too well but I'm hopefully tonight these will help me crash there's a very slight cannabis scent from it it smells more like candy than cannabis not sure this is I want to say this might be Apple but also it also might be a line I want to say a Pluto John taste this sugar sugar doesn't seem to have that much of a cannabis taste on it and must be more inside the gummy so I'm gonna pop this in give it a couple chose and see if it tastes like alright that was a very nice apple taste didn't have a nice cannabis undertone to it too very chewy gummy unless you could kind of help with the texture of it yeah we'll check back this is a cold minute no all right berth up almost forgot check it for me for me it'd be very relaxed deep fry sleep forever right now gummies I mean it tastes real good got a nice cannabis tasting [Music]", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "zUHDLPbnYBA": "good afternoon and welcome to episode 7 of the ganja geezer it's a very sunny afternoon here in Colorado at convenient I just looked for 20 p.m. so for 20 I'm going to do another review today and what we're going to be reviewing today is a product called the blue kuduro pick this up last week as a buy one get one i'm going to try the hybrid version of it today so combinations teva indica and this is made by a company called MIP manufacturer website dub dub dub deep blue kudu calm I'll put that link down in the description 100 milligrams in this bar and it's kind of when they described it to me it's kind of like a tootsie roll so the ingredients on this are chocolate organic vanilla extract organic tangerine flavor oil powdered sugar organic coconut oil nonfat dry milk cocoa powder light corn syrup and cannabis and again there's 100 milligrams in this little nut log here there's a technical difficulty so what I'm going to do now it's also know also here it says new and improved recipe and then I've always loved new and improved always implies that it was old and lousy before so I'm going to take this thing and it doesn't seem to be really very packets friendly here so I'm peeling off the end it's going to peel back I'm probably to take about a fifth of this it's kind of crumbly it's not like a toy Tootsie Roll is kind of like a compressed brown kind of crumbling off as I check yeah it's kind of nasty so when I cough about that much little knife down here I'm very soft softer than a 20 cut off the end here got your rather unappetizing little compressed now and avoid instead of the circle so let's pop this in the mouth and see what happens the very weedy very very weedy and taste nobody would eat this and I realize it's not just a chocolate brownie or chocolate fudge it's got more of a consistency of fudge and then a tootsie roll it's not nearly as chewy but again a heavy heavy on weedy taste and 100 milligrams per log so that would and I pay ten dollars for this now to be fair i got this buy one get one at the giving tree it was a the buy one get one day for selected edibles there but i'm going to evaluate this based on its actual list price so that would give it am milligram per doc milligram to dollar ratio at ten so that's not very good that's Louis one of the three that I've reviewed so far that's it for now if I think of anything else up tomorrow when I come back and give you the evaluation for the actual pain relief and effects I'll let you know well it's next morning now this is the recap of the review of the blue kuduro the 100 milligram hybrid version that I took about a quarter of the roll last night so that should have been around 20 to 25 milligrams and let's recap the taste and consistency well this ain't no tootsie roll you know this kind of way it was described to me at the dispensary this Mort tasted like a dry fudge with a serious ganja funk I mean it was a really strong there's no way you can miss it the aftertaste wasn't bad but not good I've said the consistency was the most unappealing thing about it it kind of tasted like dry dry really dry fudge just like a Elmo sandy taste so with that I have to say I have to give the edible rating of this as six so taste rating on this of the four of them out of the four rating from my scale I give it a six now pain relief this is the high point of this um little long goodie this worked really better than I expected based on its reported milligram content within 90 minutes I was fully medicated and at that peak I experienced a serious body effect I mean it was a significant body effect I could really feel that the pain relief was excellent felt a little heavy in the body but not in an unpleasant way and also a very solid head effect a very lightheaded fat and solid had effect nothing that I couldn't handle it wasn't like I was unable to comport myself in public I would say this hybrid definitely lean toward the indica side of the scale based on amount of body effect but overall very very good lasted also for a very long time the head effects were gone within four to five hours and the body fix lasted until after I fell asleep now so that was 6 plus 6 7 plus hours and woke up this morning felt very good was able to do a three mile mark with a mile walk with minimal discomfort after the way I felt yesterday that was saying something I have to give the coup du roule to some hybrid cooter roll a 9 rating on pain relief so very very good third part of my I'm rating scale is side effects as I said I got a significant amount of body high and that made for some couch lock not bad i mean it i was very very relaxed actually sat through an episode of american pickers and I hate shows like that so I kind of tells you i might have experienced some couch lock but i was stable still able to read in function i was also able to go out into a couple errands so I was not scared to go outside or didn't feel uncomfortable so I'll give this a good solid raining of 84 lack of side effects very good and value this is where it gets hit again this is 100 milligram role for ten dollars that's its list price now I said before that I got it as a bogo the buy one get one at the giving tree so instead of 100 milligrams for ten dollars i got 200 milligrams for ten dollars but that's a sale price and i only go by a retail price for the rating so at the retail price of 100 milligrams per ten dollars it gets the rating at the ratio of 10 milligrams per dollar and that's the worst i've done so far and i'm going to have to give that a value of six on the scale alright in summary that means that you had a 64 taste a 9 for pain relief a sick an 84 side effects and a 64 value that gives you after you / for a ganja geezer rating of 7.25 but actually you notice there it's a 7 I decided that as subjective as these are you don't I'm just going to round down if it's below point 5 on the scale I'm going to round down if it's above point 5 on the scale I'll round up so the actual rating will be a 7 well that's it for now that's a review of this next maybe not next time but I had to mention here that I had a low kudu sativa role which I will be reviewing the future i'll probably do it in a much shorter format maybe just actually do the effects and not the unwrapping and everything just to say how that worked out but until then i'm going to say goodbye and stay medicated you",

doesn't taste like soda it just seems like orange you weed drink tastes like orange tastes like weed it's kind of thick I kind of taste the fit the fizz of the soda I don't know if it's because it's

hybrid really kicked in in this drink of the orange kush THC soda the indica is strong in my body right now and the sativa is very strong in my brain my words are not keeping up with my brain right

medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about your milligram egde shame on you for your stupid story that you have online about what a cool brand you are looking out for the customer and yadda-yadda you got a bunch of horseshit well you know what I'm sorry I said all that I would love to talk to you guys if any one of you wants to come on wheats and talk about your products and and and tell me why I'm wrong and maybe show me the show me the batch that got lab tested so I can see for myself that you actually do what you say and

bummer bummer another we've had like four or five bad ones in a row I feel like who well it's um gold we'll strike gold soon we'll find we'll find that diamond in the rough I'm sure here on weeds but we've had a string of bad ones but that can only mean good things ahead and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching sorry I've been such a downer on this review I it bums me out when I have to bum anybody else out but you know I do what I can alright guys well whatever that means thank you so much for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace", "bpMCb1NC4QU": "hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new my name is cora and today we're going to talk about gummies these are rnr brothers gummies they are 100 milligram mango hybrid one of the things i really really like about the r brands is they are specific so you have sativa hybrid and indica they come in 100 milligram 250 milligram 500 milligram and they recently came out with a remix edition that is a thousand milligram so use caution um easy to open on these i got the mango this is the second package that i've gotten um the first one was the watermelon these are good the texture is soft hmm mmm yummy the mango could be dangerous i'm like freak when it comes to mango flavor yummy those melted really well um i felt like it fully dissolved the sugar wasn't too much um yeah yummy i want to have another one but i better not um just because it's too early i think um i react a little different to gummies than most people do most edibles in general put me down um those are really good the last batch that i had was the indica uh watermelon indica and i used those in the evening and i did like sleep a little bit better i have terrible sleep habits so it's always an issue for me when it comes to bedtime i don't i don't fall asleep well and then on top of that i don't stay asleep i'm usually up at least minimum of five times a night a couple of days ago i think i was up almost 10 times it was freaking ridiculous um honestly i think i have sleep apnea which is what wakes me up it's like i have panic attacks um it's kind of like torture it sucks um i'm gonna have a little bong ramp cheers guys [Music] okay now that i have recovered from coughing um i'm back um so yeah if you guys have the opportunity to try these r r brothers out go ahead and do that because they're really good um 100 milligrams runs about 25 bucks no i take that back 20 bucks in my dispensary i work with classy grass um the 250 runs about 35 and it goes on and on from there so yes those are really good if you guys get a chance to try them please do let me know if you have tried them before in the little comment section below i would appreciate that um so yeah i'm gonna let you guys go we will see you in the next video thank you for watching um if you like these kind of videos please consider subscribing down below um hit the little bell notification so that you get notified when i upload videos so we'll see you guys later", "dET2NXhLt1g": "[Music] howdy friends welcome the week's the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we really help you determine which products there and your dispensaries vast library of edibles is actually worth your money which ones are a bunch of [ __ ] and which ones are actually gonna get you high so today we're taking all our second look at a product from Miss Mary Jane's edibles we're gonna review our second cakepop from them if you missed my first review I quite liked it it got me pretty high not outrageously height but it tasted amazing so I really quite enjoyed it so yeah we for the first time reviewed the cookies and cream today we are taking a look at Miss Mary Jane's chocolate turtle cake pop so you can see right here 100 milligrams as rated by the fine folks at SC labs which I can always love to see on my packaging anytime I see that lab verification I feel a little bit more encouraged that it's going to be as potent as advertised um I love the packaging on this the nice little box here packaging nice it's got all the great information right it's got nutrition information ingredients everything you could want on the packaging and as for price ten bucks there at the bottom but I bought these two for 15 which is a pretty good value for a hundred milligram edible especially for one that tastes so goddamn good so I'm gonna shut up now I'm gonna open up this cake pop I give it a taste let you guys know how it tastes how it smells all that fun stuff and then like all our weeks reviews I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the Edward with you alright so just like the other one packaging a little bag in there can be a little tough to open but we'll get it maybe uh-huh uh-oh party foul my cake pop is no longer a cake pop it is now just a little candy ball so there it is sans pop sans stick but a little ball of cake with some peanuts at top or not peanuts what kind of walnuts right that's what's on turtle let's give it a taste very cool very [ __ ] well well that's good there's just as good as the just as good as the cookies and cream cake pop really like the taste really like oh man delicious no cannabis taste whatsoever so in terms of taste we got two for two here for the cake pops now we just have to wait two hours to see if it's gonna get me just as high so guys that's gonna do it for this first half of this week's review I'll see you in two hours peace in two hours since I had the chocolate turtle cake pop from Miss Mary Jane's edibles and just like the cookies and cream cake pop I like it quite a bit this is two for two both in terms of taste and and potency again it's not an overwhelmingly potent edible it's a hundred milligrams and sort of right at that hundred milligram line for sure so if you like them a little bit lower dose store if you're looking for something a little bit more mellow this is a great thing to try again it tastes so good I can't emphasize enough how I mean there's just I I detected no cannabis taste on either one I mean again how sort of pleasantly buzzed they got me these are a good value especially if you can find out at the two for fifteen price that's a pretty good value I think it don't think you're gonna be disappointed with that with that price and the taste and results from them so I was pretty pleased with my little detour and to Miss Mary Jane Miss Mary Jane's edibles I hope Miss Mary Jane's sticks around after the an apocalypse here and comes back with some good products in the future because these these are winners I think and guys that is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace okay", "7L3EJtey2lU": "hi I'm Kara Scott welcome to my youtube channel today on in the truck it's a rainy miserable day here in Massachusetts my back is killing me my music killing me so I can watch the small corn on my last bowls that I have I gotta try and get more I've been saving this for a rainy day I guess literally it will be a rainy day I got this leaf eater edible I showed these a while back when I god I'm like couple weeks ago I got 80 grams per gummy milligrams for going so let's hope this helps out it's definitely a different flavor to check in later and let you guys know what I feel see if it hits me as well as any of the edibles I make for myself it's how I judge everything because those things always have me [ __ ] good I gotta go finish work I'll check on one of the old idle poos alright I'm back with a quick update it is right around almost three hours since I took the leaf-eater 80-milligram cannabis gummy bear whatever a gummy [ __ ] thing they have and quite honestly I don't feel I would smoked I haven't done anything since the first part of this video about the smoked my last bowl will weed that I have until like two hours from now the last bowl will call it a wrap on this video just another edible that I've gotten from a dispensary or cannabis edible company and they're just garbage I've had one gummy bear that rocked me I felt good off of it for like five six hours and other than that it's really only done the edibles that I make that I've ever felt so I don't know what the difference was once I made for myself work every time yet I've had one experience with other people's edibles of done anything for me so guess I gotta keep looking for [ __ ] better edibles I mean there's tons of different local companies around so I'm sure this ones out there that can do the job I've got to come across them that's what I like to do when I take edibles too is I like to just eat it and see where it goes from that well you're not three hours into it if you're not really here or not I mean I'm probably not going to I mean it's not like the mescaline I took six hours later I wasn't feeling it so I took this [ __ ] six hours later me and my friends were all like this is a bunch of garbage I'm like I'm going home [ __ ] this blah blah blah I go home I trip balls with this wicked intense body trip for like 5 out was alone in my bed just like tensing up effect and releasing and like taunting up and like really single just crazy I heard silence hippies say in a video that she had eaten and it was like too much floor or something 60 milligrams of inedible on a flight back from California I wish that could happen to me that's inaudible 80 milligrams and supposed to be from California not all Oh Scooby Snacks and yes I just split on the floor on my trunk that's how bad it was now you gotta clean that up I'll see you later peace", "Jsr_LEOd_xI": "everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about dedicated to medicated and I realize I've been saying that wrong the entire time I just now noticed the two there and the dedicated it's not just dedicated medicated it's dedicated to medicated which I'm not sure why it's not dedicated to medication but whatever I know that that doesn't quite run anyways here's what we're looking at today the dedicated to medicated Reese's treat 100 milligram edible here so we've got a little warning on it at the bottom we've got our ingredients which is curious because if you look there it says ingredients marshmallow cannabis oil dry cereal and ellipsis what does that ellipsis who knows well anyways guys if you've never seen wheats before the way this works is I'm gonna eat this open up this bad boy eat a good bit of it here in front of you guys let you know how it's tasting let you know how it smells all that good stuff and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how the edible is actually hitting so without any further ado I'm gonna open up this packaging munch give it a little munch here see how it's tasting and I'm gonna finish it off off camera you come back to you guys in just a little bit okay so we're not further ado let's do this okay hi guys sorry I'm using a gimbal right now that's making this very difficult alright we are back with our Reese's treat Reese's treat here a hundred milligram bar cereal bar let's give it a taste first give it a smell smells exactly like Reese's treat cereal Reese's puffs of cereal mixed with the marshmallow fluff how does it taste like a Castelli version of what you're measuring um the Reese's puffs cereal is not a good medium for crispy treat they're too puffy did you dick they're too hard to chew so okay I mean I like rice krispies treats and I like recent puff cereal but it's just not the best of those combinations so I'm gonna finish this off here because it's gonna take me a while to this whole hung down and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling if it's anything like many of the other dedicated to medicated it's gonna be a little disappointing I've reviewed a couple of their products in the past and film them all little underwhelming but I'm hoping to be surprised with that guys thanks for watching I'll see you in two hours bye [Music] hello everyone welcome back two weeks it's been two hours here since I had the dedicated to medicated racy Street and this makes the triumvirate three four three dedicated medicated that are not so good this hundred milligram editable excuse me has no effect whatsoever don't feel anything or I don't think I feel anything total total bust but as they only cost four dollars it's hard to be super super disappointed but you'd hope even for four dollars that you'd feel something anything but that that makes the third dedicated to medicated in a row that has been more than disappointing so I'll review one or two more see if they get any better and if not that's gonna be that's gonna be it it's gonna be curtains with a dedicated to medicated line for me you'd think three strikes and you're out but I'm a little bit more persistent than that okay guys and with that that'll be it for this episode of wheats we will check you out on the next review thank you so much for watching see you next time hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "dRCWeLKTTyw": "hey YouTube this is grant Smith from Colorado I'm coming at you live from the mile-high and I am just going to do a quick review here of another edible medical marijuana product here and that is the sour gummies by a company called wana I am not familiar with them this is my first experience with their product and so these are sour gummies really not sure I think that yeah they're about 10 milligrams apiece in terms of THC per and apparently it was made I don't know you got all sorts of information about the plants they used in different trim apparently they use some trim I tore this package up like an idiot so anyway these are what they look like and you know if you're into gummies and you're into that whole thing that's flavor and that texture you would really like these the flavor is great I'm not really the biggest fan of the texture personally so sorry one sec here we are you know here if you're a gummy pen you will enjoy them if not you probably just you know like me you'll be able to tolerate them and you know I'm certainly not trying to knock this product at all because they definitely tasted great again I'm just not a huge fan of the actual gummy textures so you can see they're covered with you know crystals or whatever infused I really don't know anything much about this particular process but this is what they they look like you know standard candy and that's ten milligrams of THC infused within this and that's a pretty good deal you know it'll get you a good little buzz going on and you know if you have a high tolerance level you may want to eat a couple of them if you don't well um I'm sure one will do it and so you know just again I just wanted to remind you all out there that if you're not you know here in Colorado or California someplace where you can kind of get these things with a little less you know going to the street kind of deal you know you may you may not really know how to use them right and so I just want to help everybody out there you know if you get your hands on this kind of stuff just remember don't go overboard with it you know you'll enjoy it so much more if you don't eat too many at once you can really make yourself sick and you know regret doing it if you just tear into them like that so anyways hope you guys are out there having a great one tonight and if you would like me to review anything or have any questions or anything like that if you want to see anything let me know and give me any suggestions that you've got thank you for watching and be safe out there alright peace", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "NvLcVeAwem4": "[Music] the cannabis market is the wild [ __ ] West and there isn't a grizzled Sheriff and his loyal deputies around to keep you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to include it maybe in a future video or pin it up there

this is the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "NM60zEAYLFo": "hello friends welcome elites the marijuana review ship formerly the marijuana edible review show now we're covering everything we're everywhere we're doing at all welcome to weeds guys we are here to help you make sense of your dispensary we are here to help you understand what products to spend your hard-earned money on mostly edibles but we do a little bit of everything and today we are proving that because we are doing our third cartridge review third yeah one two three third cartridge review here on wheats we have reviewed rove and we have reviewed crafted and now today we are going to be reviewing the cartridges from the fine may be fine folks i'm not sure if they're fine folks or not we'll find out i know that i did not enjoy their edible candy so far but without too much more preamble we're talking flavor x today flavor x blueberry cush indica 500 milligram cartridge i picked this up for my dispensary here in a Long Beach for a $35 so not super cheap but not crazy expensive either sort of a little bit higher than average for the cost of a cartridge so in the back we see the ingredients are ultrafine cannabis oil and terpenes and that is it but I don't see any other necessary lab results I see what's distributed by and in compliance with but I don't see their lab results they said they're voted best tasting and highest potency but they don't tell us who gave them the honor of being the best-tasting and most potent cartridge which is always to me a sign of trouble when somebody says we're award-winning but we're not gonna tell you what award we won okay enough of that let's not prejudge here let's let's judge on the merits and not by past experience or by crazy packaging so let's talk about the packaging first and foremost this is without a doubt the cheapest packaging I have seen for a cartridge I mean it's just designed to sit on a shelf it's not fancy at all let's compare it to a rogue box which I have right next to me here I mean look at the packaging for this road cartridge in comparison it's it's amazing it's so fancy it's so nice so incredible this is pretty bare-bones stuff but it's not so much about the packaging it's really about what's inside that packaging that counts so let's see what's going on here this again is blueberry cush not flavored in any other way all terpenes so it's all natural or so they say in terms of flavor so here we go we've got it inside here pretty standard issue cartridge looking let's open her up it tasted terrible okay so here's the cartridge they say this is a half gram of oil in there it doesn't really look like a half gram of oil to be honest but otherwise a pretty bare-bones cartridge looks about the same as any other cartridge except there's is that plastic or glass I think it's plastic there instead of glass which is a cheaper material does not look as fancy as some of the other cartridges certainly not as classy as say the crafted cartridge but let's open it up and who cares if it looks doesn't look fancy as long as it tastes and hits great so this is just your standard 510 battery thread got it plugged into my fancy vape pen here let's give it a hit so first things first not the easiest draw in the world you have to really pull out that drop to get it to come out but once you get to come out it's nice and clean the taste the taste isn't doing much for me to be honest it's not terrible but I have certainly had better tasting cartridges it's not gonna make you gag or anything it's just a very neutral very very cannabis e tasting one it definitely don't taste the blueberry cush it just tastes like your standard-issue babe cartridge certainly nothing I would vote best tasting it's also a little hot it's a little hotter than some of the others I'm going to turn down my voltage on my vape pen mine as an adjustable voltage here I've got it about a third of the way up so I don't think it would be that coming out that hot but it does come out a little bit warmer than some of the others and with taste again is okay well and after a good solid five puffs there I'm feeling pretty high I'm probably at a 3-4 somewhere in there so not an outrageous bout in line with other cartridges this one is an indica and right now I guess I'm not excuse me I'm not feeling particularly in the couch at this moment it's not hitting me as hard as I would like to be to be entirely honest it's not hitting me as hard as I would have hoped and it's certainly not hitting me like indica normally does it's not making me sleepy it's not making me tired it's just there's a sort of vague head hi there on initial inspection um in terms of taste and postin see this is this is not in the running for the best of the best I don't believe I am would not I would not discount it just yet I want to count it out but for the price the taste in the the potency this is not among the best I've ever had if I'm being entirely honest but but we will get the complete review I am going to finish this cartridge off and I will come back to you once it's over with to give you my wrap-up thoughts because you can't really tell after just five hits if this is going to be worth it so guys I'm going to a puff on this for the next couple of days let you know how long it took me to get through with how much usage and if my thoughts have evolved or changed over the next couple of days but right now I would tell you probably stick with so far I would say Rove is the best cartridge I have tried and it is also the cheapest and the best tasting so I would stick with Rove if you see it but I will let you know if my thoughts change so guys through the magic of editing I will see you in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be a couple of days thanks for watching see in just a bit peace [Music] hi guys welcome back to wheats this is our follow-up for the flavor ex blueberry cush in the cartridge here and my thoughts have really not evolved a whole lot since my initial impressions this is not my favorite cartridge this is not the best cartridge I've ever had not by a long shot it's not a complete disaster but man I I think there are quite a few ones that I would suggest over flavor X I'm trying to get the camera to focus in there so you can see here all done all done for both so in every kind of metric it was just kind of middling to me and that's you know it wasn't that great in terms of taste it wasn't that great in terms of potency it lasted about two days of pretty heavy usage so it wasn't too disappointed in terms of capacity but the cartridge design was not that great the packaging was pretty bland all in all I gotta say flavor X is not what I would be reaching for and the my first choice for cartridges in the future and I'm trying to remember how much it costs I believe it was $35 and I think I might have said that in the first half of the video as well so it's you know it's it's a little bit on the expensive two side to for a half gram cartridge especially now that they charge taxes and things here in California so I'm gonna go with a pass on the flavor X cartridge you know if that's all they have at your dispensary I don't think you're gonna you know be out too much if you pick it up but but I think there are better choices for your money still so far from me I would go with Rove as my as my choice du jour of things that we have reviewed so far I think I might try to give another flavor X maybe one of their sativas a review in the future to see if it changes my mind at all but right now it's just not my favorite cartridge if I had to score between 1 to 10 which I've never done before I'd put it firmly at the well you know it's I don't like scoring things out of 10 especially something as subjective as a as a weed cartridge so scratch that sorry for even bringing that up but just on the whole just to reiterate one more time I've had better tasting cartridges I've had more potent cartridges I've had cartridges with fancier packaging not that's a big issue so it's it's gonna be a pass for me flavor X and especially this blueberry cush cartridge here I think you can do better for your money out there guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you guys watching as always thank you so much guys out there and we will see you on our next review peace", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business thanks guys so much for watching this review and we have nearly 200 other reviews and our archives a tweets reviews.com so please feel free to take a

review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the news hopefully things will change but for now that looks like it's the way it's going to be

new video so this time actually gonna be a little bit different normally you know it's a swags and flour joints i think i smoked like a few blunts on the channel but today we got some nice raspberry edibles by wild low-key gonna be about to be uh that'd be really [ __ ] up first of all because just like yo i'm gonna be taking ten of these it's a container of ten each one is ten milligrams so equals out to a hundred so basically we're going to be doing 100 milligrams of this sexy edible right here let's start it off number one god damn holy [ __ ] yo normally like edibles i've tried god

before you know like 30 minutes 45 minutes later everyone's [ __ ] painted as [ __ ] like yo these [ __ ] can be dangerous [ __ ] all right we're gonna try it on blue now because for some reason

charge the battery all right number four let's go let's go it's so good 40 milligrams of thc straight and then this baby yummy one of the first times i heard some [ __ ] edibles i didn't even know

we're looking at another edible this time we're taking a look at THC and that does not stand for what you think it stands for it stands for I think high confections so that chocolate bar brand there's a ton of different flavors um first of all the 300 milligram says those are some strong milligrams like this is not this is not some black-market edible like like those nerds ropes those claim to be like 400 to 500 milligrams and I could eat one of those in one sitting and be alright but I split one of these with one of my boys and we were both absolutely folded and we're daily smokers high tolerance we were folded like I was sick I would definitely definitely be careful and these take a bit longer to kick in another edibles you think well he says you take two it takes two hours say it took about an hour and a half but some edibles only take like 45 to an hour so definitely be extremely careful I eat like maybe two pieces in here and wait like actually wait like an hour or two and then maybe one more if you still need another one but this is the blueberry blister flavor device last night I tried I tried the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and it was delicious it didn't taste like cinnamon toast crunch but cannabis plus white chocolate plus blueberries plus blueberry whole grain oats top awarded what kind of award did they win no any cannabis company in Maine so these are out of me actually I did not know that same guy confections on the bottom a lab tested every single batch subsist Ain ibly sourced so this company seems very official I'm a big fan of these so far I've not tried this flavour but serving size is one piece I would if you do not smoke like a lot every single day I would definitely just take one piece and wait a while be very careful because last night I was I was dying I thought I was dying genuinely can read all that if you would like a skin cure for test results so there are lab results on these I love that you read the ingredients like a thin not sure what that is I think that's like a one of those like a combining agent of some sort like your sugar and stuff I'll pop this bad boy open just to give you so you know how much to eat stuff there you go even if it smells delicious like these are some of the best edibles I think I've had in a very very very long time I'm keeping mine you know refrigerator cuz they're in the freezer at first now they're in the fridge cuz I goddamn I eat when I eat the first one it was a you know room temperature they've bit soft so just for the edibles sake I keep them in a fridge oh no if that's bad but don't think I don't believe it's bad I would definitely definitely pick these up I would also definitely definitely be careful when you're eating them you can always take more but you can never take less unless you you know force yourself to throw up or whatever you don't want to do that so be careful eat one or two pieces and wait a long time make sure to wait my mistake last night was eating two and then waiting like 15 minutes and eating another one than waiting like 20 minutes and eating like two more and then I was just absolutely folded so do you not do that do you not make that mistake I would definitely try these out there's so many flavors there's there's a cookies and cream but then there's also a milk and cookies would like that that shows you how many flavors there are this there's a bunch of them but check out my channel if you like this video I have tons of videos like this edibles cards all that sort of stuff and yeah be safe peace out", "REBe_aQvd_4": "hi

"KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "6sBWiwLyvK4": "[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for watching peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video

make sense of your dispensary decided to do a little bit of traveling today and buy travel I just mean about a mile away from my place here in beautiful Signal Hill California Long Beach right down there is looking a little hazy today so not quite the view what I was hoping but really I was here because I have a new camera that I want to play with so if the sound sounds terrible that's because it's just using the camera's native microphone and I suck and if the image is terrible it's because the sun's right there and I haven't looked at a few finder so we're just gonna do this one rock wild guys let me disturb hello guys and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I am sorry if I sound a little shitty I'm testing out a new camera that does not have an external mic so it's just the little microphone inside the camera today my apologies also I'm sorry if that sign sucks I don't have a viewfinder right now but what I do have for you guys is a really elaborate package one that I'm sure I'm gonna have trouble opening it is district edibles cannabis infused gummies indica raspberry hundred milligrams and as you can see this is some pretty crazy packaging and I was like these two little hooks here got a slide open I don't know we'll try to figure it out um I have had some luck with gummies recently like plus plus is great so my opinions on gummies are starting to change especially as like the shitty players leave the market like ed appears or infused creations I know they're still out there but they're not as present as they once were so now it seems there are a lot of legitimate gummy makers so I'm looking forward to this and guys I did do a little fad right before I took this bit or went on this video here so that way you are sure that I'm getting a hundred percent of this THC coming in so let's see if I can get this open here let's see it has some directions lift cap while pressing side tabs well it looks like one of the side tabs might be broken so well this is a bad scheme for for our guys at district edibles if they require such fancy packaging but their packaging is broken how are you supposed to get into the good stuff oh boy yes so this one is broken so you cannot get into it which means I'm probably gonna have to get some scissors for a crowbar because this is pretty solid plastic pretty shitty job there district edibles on your packaging I mean come on beer we all just want the weed yeah I've almost gotten it I'm just gonna break the damn thing tada we did it guys as a family as a team and here are our goodies that we are rewarded for all of our hard effort on the inside these 10 gummies right here in the back they say we are things like orbiter and gravity check and booster who knows weird little gummies they're kind of plush shaped and green as you can see and they've got just this little standard of lumen on packaging on the back of the top and guys like all of our edibles don't worry we'll be doing all 10 of these maybe not all 10 on cameras and won't bore you to death but I'm gonna let you know how they taste and then I'm gonna come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how they're actually because that's what we're so here we go taste test number one for the blue raspberry district animals and their shitty now broken ass packaging okay in terms of edible taste definitely has a cannabis taste still has that blue rat sour e blue raspberry taste not the worst edible I've ever had not the worst gummy I've ever had either but there is a strong cannabis taste to it which has me a little optimistic that it's going to be pretty poached but if you really hate cannabis tastes definitely want to give these ones a skip because they they have it for sure so here's a close-up shot of their little + or diamond dirt whatever you wanna call this cross shape do what second same as the first yep fairly strong cannabis taste but it goes away pretty quickly it's not that over overpowering style of cannabis taste either these are easy to get down they just pop right up just do them up and that guy is gonna do it for this first half I have seven more of these to get through which I will do in the next 15 minutes or so and then I will come back to you guys once we're all said and done in two hours but you know how we're actually feeling so thanks for watching wheat guys and I'll see you in just a bit deuces hey jerks welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two and a half actually I think closer are three hours since I last checked in with you and I am still talking district edibles blue raspberry indica and guys original intuition is correct in this new legal world of edibles in California gummies are pretty good now you can sort of safely by gummies that are securely vetted and lab tested all that good stuff I think a lot of the bad actors are gone um just because I don't think you can go buy a big bag of gummy worms at Costco anymore slather a couple of milligrams of oil on it and call it a product anymore that just doesn't work in this world for both good and bad so the district 9 or the district to start district 9 the district edibles is actually pretty good the taste wasn't too bad there was a decent cannabis taste to had not the cannabis haze was decent is just flatly pronounced but I am actually rather high I got up to I would say I almost even hit an eight for a second maybe that's because I was playing some Red Dead - and everything just felt a little bit more euphoric in that moment anyways but regardless I can tell you these are pretty potent I picked these up for 20 bucks in the dispensary in Long Beach which is about the going price of any easily and between this and plus it's pretty much a draw for me they're both now legal edible brands basically the same format each I think plus has five milligrams these have ten so these are about as strong as like the cushy punch hundred milligrams or the plus hundred milligrams so I don't have any problem recommending them I just think they're packaging sucks it's unfortunate that this one happened to be broken but you know it shouldn't break so that's one downside but other than that actually really really liked the district edibles I keep forgetting that name I keep forgetting that name so guys that is gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on a next review this is", "l1-cjiLQl4M": "good morning everybody Connecticut medical marijuana credit care how are you today

you really quick as well for a better onset most people are taking quite a few less than the normal dose because they're not needing it to absorb into their system so you may be if you're a 10 milligram dose or just start off with the five milligrams and see how you do you might find that five milligrams works a lot better than you thought it would they're a really good product to try out if you haven't tried them yet there are 25 dollars though though so they're a little bit more expensive than the twenty dollar packs that they were at they definitely worth the five dollar increase and what's nice about those one for multiple different reasons people that in like dosages and also people they maybe not like those two genes but they needed dose throughout the day you know just to say if you know whatever you might have a pain issue or whatever your element might be you know we're you know say instead of taking hundred milligrams right now and that does be for half a day or the whole day you take you know milligrams throughout the day and what's nice about those is because yeah they're five milligrams for each little piece and so you know exactly what you're getting because each little gummy is five milligrams itself so 5 10 15 20 and so on the whole entire package is 100 so you're getting 20 pieces there however you need it you need to use them throughout the day or if it's just small dosage where you need to use it once in the day 500 grams doesn't it's a really good way to start out and try out and see where you're at and also with the technology of those ones it's a new we're sitting nano is what they don't make via via Villa bill yeah where it absorbs into your system faster so you're supposed to fill the medical benefit of it a lot more so they say that sometimes less is more like those like where you normally use higher milligram image when you're using a product like that that has that technology where it's delivering the medication to you faster you use less because you're supposed to be filling it more and with those ones being that they're such a quick onset that if you have problems sleeping those ones are great one being that we have indica ones you can just maybe take one going before bed and see if that does you well and if not you can always you mean I mean it's not great for your teeth but you can always take another one to help you sleep so make sure you brush your teeth in the morning when you get up but otherwise you know if you know your dosage just take the amount that you need and see how it goes I mean they're a great product they're gonna be very accurate and what you're you're doing if you're looking for 30 milligrams go for the full 30 and you're gonna get what you're looking for us that's for sure with those so check us out our website green gold cultivators ich komm give us a call to store if you have any questions 209 six seven four eight zero zero eight visit us in person at five six eight angels

of you guys may know on how I like to smoke my cannabis and I like to smoke it through joints but I also smoke it in other forms today I'm gonna do a review with you guys on a product that I liked it's from canna and it's cannabis infused of hybrid blue raspberry gummy and I like this product because I just take one of these then to be honest guys I was very nervous throughout the day on what I was gonna cook I had so much going on I didn't know what doesn't cook my family for dinner and once I took one of these I mixed up whatever was in my fridge and I came up with a great chick chicken dinner that my family fell in love with so I was definitely chill and enjoying actually cooking and in the moment at the time so it got me to that level I wanted to be on it definitely would recommend taking these if you're at home chillin or if you're somewhere where you can smoke you could take one of these babies and it'll it'll get you to where you want to get to definitely I'm actually gonna take one right now it is Sunday so I'm gonna enjoy my Sunday and taking one of these maybe taking two you guys take care and have a great Sunday bye bye [Music] [Music] [Music]", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "CpV7wPw6edU": "it's going on human so sapped out of my

"wDEe9C5786s": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our fourth look third look at a syrup lien that is I think the kids are calling it lien these days which i think is a take-off of when you used to do scissor with codeine in it this is not codeine this is just weed just good old-fashioned THC straight from the earth the good stuff none of that none of those opiates or opioids or anything to get you addicted so this is a pro methylene liquid syrup two fluid ounces watermelon flavored and it proclaims to be 600 milligrams of indica THC I guess they're saying it has 1200 milligrams of syrup total and half of it is indica of course we're gonna be doing the entire bottle 600 milligrams is a dot I'm not gonna do 600 milligrams right from the get-go although I'm pretty sure this might be another scam so I picked this up very cheaply I think it was 35 bucks for a 600 milligram syrup which is a very good deal if in fact is true but let's take a look at this bottle and just see what kind of red red flags just sort of pop off look how cheap it looks just a gross little cheap sticker poured out on there you can barely read what is you know what's on there because the printing is pretty awful shake well every use it's very muddy muddy is the adjective they use fair enough in THC We Trust so again this little bottle it proclaims that 600 milligrams hc' but I am skeptical because of the price because of the size because of the packaging all of that leads me to believe that this might actually be a another scam but I am certainly hoping to get quite high off of it and I realize I probably should have brought something to drink with me in case this thing tastes truly wretched which it might very well so let's go ahead and take a look at this Pro methylene liquid syrup let's shake it very well because it's muddy now it suggests that for a beginner to do half a teaspoon it says for an expert to do 2 to 3 teaspoons or 4 Club meanies whatever the hell that means 4 to 7 teaspoons which is what we're gonna be doing I have no idea what Club MIM is is maybe you guys can help me figure that out come on let's focus camera there it is 4 to 7 teaspoons tablespoons rather Club em I am eyes II don't know all right so our muddy stuff is shooken oh it smells really bad and it looks really gross look at the top there ah oh it is muddy as they said it is muddy well maybe I should go get something to mix it with [ __ ] it here we go 3 2 1 down the hatch see how much we can get down ooh ooh we got a lot of it down we got most of it there yak it's actually not super super gross it's not good tasting by any stretch but I'm gonna finish it off I'm gonna give my second self a second to let that percolate through my stomach and then I will be back to you guys like all of our reviews I'm coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this promy Faline what a dumb name is actually hitting because that's the most important part of this edible review you don't really care how it tastes because you're gonna CAC it down no matter what it does if it gets you high so we'll find out soon guys I will see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the pro me feeling whatever it's called I don't need to say their name anymore because I don't need to give them any advertising it is a bunch of gar [ __ ] 600 milligrams my booty look at those eyeballs white as the winters snow I fell feel roughly infinity more times hi doing a cannabis 100 milligram syrup than that six hundred milligram syrup from Pro methylene and my buddy squids here to join us hey squiddy so yeah do not give them any money just like I thought it was a total total scam an absolute trying to fleece you for your money there's nothing in there it tasted terrible at the bottom because there was a lot of like ground-up plant matter or whatever in there it was disgusting I don't know what it was probably wasn't actually weeds I certainly don't feel hi disgusting I at the very bottom tasting does didn't get me high at all an absolute it's like I took $35 and lit it on fire an absolute travesty of a product do not buy it if you see it at a dispensary tell them not to carry it because they're just doing their customers a disservice by carrying this [ __ ] that is Pro methylene I think I'm not going to look again because I don't want to if I have it wrong great they don't need the they don't need the endorsement they don't need the free advertising but I wanted to share with you some little message of positivity something something something to look forward to so I even though normally in these quick short bad reviews they don't come with the cherry on top this time I think I'm gonna go with a give you guys a little cherry on top a little something that you can take with you uh something to enjoy over the next week or so just that can be enjoyed with or without weed something that will just bring a little bit of a joy or a smile to your face so on this cherry on top I want to just recommend a youtube channel that I like quite a bit and that is PBS is eons PBS's eons PBS has a bunch of really great like science channels that all range from about seven to fifteen minute videos and all kinds of different topics Aeons is a great one talking a mixture between geology archaeology paleontology and a bunch of other cool subjects and topics all sort of rolled into one giant eon uh I think that's that's right alright so yeah check that out PBS is eons ye ons and just search for that on YouTube you'll find it it's a great thing to watch well hi just let the videos rule and and learn some cool stuff and that guys is gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry it was such a shitty one we've had a real run of losers in a row here but good things ahead I'm so guys thank you so much for watching weeds and we will see you on the next review peace", "cf9uSYlnJqE": "hey what's going on everyone jay ping here again with another west coast weed tour review today i'm going to be reviewing a product from one of my favorite edible companies on the west coast smokies we're going to be reviewing their watermelon gummies the sour one it is a fruit chew 100 milligram in the pack 10 milligrams of gummy um five milligrams carbs four grams of sugar i'm sorry five grams of carbs four grams of sugar um manufactured a package back in july 14th it's a delicious item ingredients sugar corn syrup pectin dectro citric acid sodium acetate natural and artificial flavoring a couple food colorings red 40 red three because soy lecithin versus sunflower for most cannabis extract and then it labels display and that's one of the key things i love seeing the actual type of oil or extract listed that's key and that's it contains soy at smokey's edibles across the board for social media and in california it is powered by the loud pack group so shout out to loud pack vegan gluten free uses distillate sour fruchu we're gonna do a one bite review i'm gonna talk to you guys about it here we go here we go oh man i'm excited [Music] this one's being tough to get out it's the last one i let i told my lady it says save so you can eat the other ones but i need you to save me one for the final review and it's tough right now to get to so what we're gonna do is just rip this open a little more there we go all right all right so she's the sticky one we've got a nice chewy gummy here it tastes to me like the sour patch kids the watermelon candies this is exactly what it tastes like like identical it's sweet you can taste a little bit of the cannabis on the inside of the gummy which i really like for me i use edibles to sleep i use them to go hiking as well and i like knowing that the cannabis is in there i feel like when you can taste it it affirmates the high a little bit [Music] i love it flavor is on point flavor is on point i'm thinking score out of ten aside from the packaging i hate i love how it views i just don't like it that it's in the bag i'd rather much rather be in a plastic container or some other kind of container but you know for me this product is almost a perfect product you know no gelatin made with pectin it does say distillate on it i think this is a 9.75 for me out of 10.", "M-QREv9LFV8": "[Music] hi friends welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are taking our second look at a gummy a gummy manufacture that I quite liked the first time I reviewed and that is tiki killer's tiki killer's this was a real surprise for me the first time I reviewed it is a 300 milligram edible this time it's peach flavor we reviewed the green apple the first time it surprised me in many ways one gummies rarely get me high just I find them to be usually less potent than this sort of confectionaries but this one got me nice and high too for its price normally things you know in the edible world you get what you pay for a 300 milligram edible for 15 bucks especially in this sort of not so nice packaging it's just sort of a ziploc bag with some kind of stickers on the front and back you know it's not the nicest packaging and usually that's a sign of you know a bad omen but in the first case it worked out well so I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I just didn't get a great batch or something so I decided to go ahead and pick up another one and give it a review as well to see if you know they are another gummy brand worth investing in so let's go ahead and open up the tiki killers peach 300 milligram here and give it a taste and if this is your first time tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work real simple I'm gonna eat this product here and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours for you it'll be just a couple of seconds I'll just edit right together and you'll see exactly just exactly how high this product got me because that's the most important part of the edible review right is finding out exactly how high you're gonna get you know is it gonna work for you or is it gonna just be a waste of money that's what we're here for it we so I do like the sculpt of these gummies there are these cool little like Tiki shaped things here boo boo boo boo like I'm covered in some granulated sugar as well the taste in the green apple is great let's give a the peachy go well that has a very peachy flavor actually there must be some real peach in there actually I mean there's just like cannabis taste to it but compared to a lot of other gummies I mean this is this is amber ogia this is good stuff again there's a slight slight cannabis taste so if you can't stand any taste a weed you know maybe give it a skip but for gummies this is great there are four of them in the package this is 75 milligrams each I'm gonna finish these guys off if you watch too and then I will see you in two hours thanks for watching witch guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace Oh quick addendum I should mention I had fat before before I consume these just a little bit before I had these so I did have some fat already so I didn't forget to take fat I just didn't take any additional fat during the video but I did have some right before this so so rest assured consistency in our experiments is key here at wheats thanks for watching sorry about the the late-breaking news talk to you soon [Music] just ate some spicy food that's why I got them all I'm all sweaty here just well probably not spicy for any of you listening but spicy for me I'm a real real [ __ ] when it comes to the spicy stuff I like it I just just can't really handle it handle it but what I can handle although I am handling it not as easily as I would have thought is the Tiki Killers that's two for two for the Tiki Killers I am quite high I would say I'm at a six so I again this is a $15.00 edible for a 300 milligram err I got a discount I believe I got it for 13 bucks so a pretty good value most gummies like comparatively the 200 milligram cuz she punch is twenty dollars I don't know I mean like I'm not gonna suggest that this 300 milligrams is equivalent to their 200 milligrams or anything like that but I dunno if you like gummies it's a pretty good value it got me quite high it's quite tasty it's got shitty packaging and I just now noticing you can kind of see there if it doesn't shimmer too much some like oily residue left in that package which is probably just the way that the the way they get the tea and it's probably just cannabis oil of some kind leftover but I I really like Tiki Killers it's good stuff still probably wouldn't be my first choice for gummy edibles I think I would still reach for flourish first but if I saw these in my dispensary and wasn't looking for some kind of confectionery was looking for something a little bit easy you know quicker to eat less calories and they had Tiki killers there I grabbed them I've give him a shot um they're definitely two for two and they seem to be pretty reliable so guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats if you enjoyed this review please do me a favor give me one of those little thumb yuppies subscribeee also you can even follow me on twitter a tweets reviews or give me a like on the facebook at wheats reviews on facebook as well i would super appreciate it thank you so much for watching guys we will

reviewed some gummies so I figured it's time to dip our toe back in gummy land and take a look at cushy edibles watermelon rings contains 320 milligrams I picked this up in my dispensary for 15 bucks so 8 L of a good deal which should be red flags sirens blaring what do we have here shitty packaging just stickers on a ziploc bag an exaggerated a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- Oh gummies obviously gummies are already outside of a few examples look at flourish look at occasionally cushy punch or tiki killers uh we've got exaggerated mode grammage and a cheap price so that all tells us that this might not be as good as advertised we're gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they're amazing but who knows when you see too good to be true pricing shitty packaging and gummies it's usually a recipe for failure but as I said we will give them the benefit of doubt and cross our fingers and hope that they are going to work so why do I have this double chocolate loaf cake well just to maximize my chances of getting high I like to take a little bit of fat before hand there's something to help process the THC in case it hasn't been properly managed so people bite of the double chocolate loaf I have a feeling it's gonna be the best tasting thing in this reveal this is dollar 49 at Ralph's on clearance it's still really good that's my dog nard hurting it real name's noop that corner okay I can upload a for now let's open up the packaging whoo these are stinky and ugly they're very green these watermelon rings look at how ugly that is it is just green all over if they're trying to win the contest for most edible looking most like looks like it has wheat in it they're doing a pretty damn good job but again it's not a contest about how it looks it's about how it makes you feel but before you have feel anything you got to try to taste it and I have a feeling I'm not gonna like the taste of these so here we go that's kind of weird it's like then what it doesn't that's kind of a neutral weedy taste but it's not terrible it's not as bad as at a pure infuse creations with their awful bitter gross after tasting this isn't that bad but the weedy tasting part is like the sugar on top it's quite odd each one of these claims to be a 20 dose 20 milligram edible really doubt that very curious again they're not great tasting but they're far from the worst tasting gummies have ever had I'm really intrigued by what is on top or whatever process they're using to get the cannabis infused it's really strange really strange you've never had an edible quite like this so guys well now I'm more curious than I was before when it comes to cushy edibles watermelon rings handcrafted in Los Angeles we're just gonna have to do the wait-and-see approach because I'm not sure so guys I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how it's going I'm gonna finish off this whole bag there's 320 milligrams we'll see and I will let you know exactly how we're doing thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace has been 2 hours since I had the cushy edibles of watermelon rings and ooh I don't it's definitely not 320 milligrams and we kind of knew that ahead of time and that's a huge strike against them exaggerating their potency but they're not totally devoid of potency I'm certainly a little high I'm kind of in the five ish range and I just don't know about the taste it wasn't disgusting but there was something very off-putting about having the sugar coating be the thing that has like the is cannabis infused it was it was very odd tasting wasn't disgusting but it was disconcerting in some way so I don't know I don't know how to articulate it exactly what does say lab tested on it again which is you know of course they're gonna say that oh it is infused coconut oil I'm seeing that now it must be the sugar that's infused I didn't I totally it's it's it's I'm confused by this one cuz she edibles because of this it does have some potency and it's affordable I got it for a pretty good price I just don't think it's as potent as they're saying and it's not gonna get you out rage ously hi I do have another cushy edibles to review and I am certainly going to review it so I would say hold off for now don't pick up any cushy edibles we'll see what the second one does if that review is favorable or you know negative whatever the case may be that's gonna be our final determination but for now if you see him at your dispensary and they are super cheap and you like gummy candy maybe give it a shot but I think I would tell people to hold off for now and the C for the second review if they're gonna you know prove to be good or bad hopefully we'll get a new termination in one way or the other alright guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I'm sorry I was a little bit wofully here I just I don't want to tell you to rush out and pick these up because again I don't think they're as I don't think there's 320 milligrams in there but they're not without their merits either and they just have a very odd taste sorry thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "gCMn2ECpP_4": "back my god I am now gonna be mad at me yeah I'm already high I be edible like I bought a root a whole day from me

marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "hOnV1X7ulRQ": "you're going on a bear hunt goodbye Haribo we can make literally anything you want out of gummy bears ice cream a

gonna add those in next we're gonna add in our pineapple juice we have a third cup here and you can use any juice you want but we chose pineapple one tablespoon agave one tablespoon lemon juice and now we're gonna blend it all up [Music] next we're gonna strain all of our mixture and make sure you get all the strawberry pulp out now that we have everything into our pot we're going to be cooking this on low heat for about 10 minutes or so and we're going to be slowly adding in four teaspoons of agar gar now we're going to put our gummy bears in the fridge we're gonna leave them in there for like around two to four hours and we're gonna let them set and we'll see in a few and that's how you make vegan gummy bears", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "qB3ebFa54v0": "okay so my father-in-law gave me this to try because I suffer from arthritis I have promised with my SI joints the arthritis is in my back and also my shoulder in my neck I have a bulged disc between c4 and c5 the amount of pills that they have tried me on is ridiculous I'm on currently on naproxen 500 I'm on a muscle relaxant you name it I I'm just tired of the pill so I'm gonna try this for the first time and see if this helps at all okay so get off okay so I opened it it is that's here let's see okay like chocolate actually tastes really good so I guess it takes up from 30 minutes to two hours I'll let you know I'll come back and let you know if I feel anything or do I have to take another one let's hope this works okay so um it's been like an hour and I feel something in there my legs a little bit jiggly right now but other than that the pain in my back I will say it's going away like it it's probably still there is just going away like I can't it's not a thumping feeling anymore [Music] so it's like 1 1 square which is 25 milligrams and for me it's working good like downstairs I was thinking I should shut off my phone and restart it but I guess I did and when I went to record this I didn't understand why the phone was turning on and so I just had to I just had to hit the button on the side and wait for it to start up and so that happened at home and my arms really sore from holding this but it's like nice to be pain-free and okay well this is all for now else to tell you that you feel really happy like thinks that you think it sounds like [ __ ] up in your head like you're gonna say it sentence and like I don't know did you say it so um my eyes feel real tingly and my heart I can't feel no gum it's just a little bit scary okay this time that's it only thirsty oh yeah I'm thirsty I feel like I should get into a comfy like a comfy space or a comfy place like the chair or something and don't you sit down there and then I don't know see what happens okay um so one thing I'm noticing too is my eyes are like glossy and I don't like that and there's people in the house all they're probably know something so I'm gonna wait until they come upstairs and when I hear them come upstairs go downstairs and buy it's getting dark out so they'll be see my look okay um so like you get good laughs and stuff like right now I'm trying hitting like a little paranoid I don't know what's up with that but I really think that like I should just say what you know like I'm feeling and then probably I don't know just like sit somewhere like works in darkroom or something or just come upstairs like it bad cuz the heart is like hmm and I feel I should talk like kind of quiet because seems like the thing to do um and you're really like your body seems like it's a really sensitive to everything my back ache it's it's still like I said I don't feel it at all seems like you had a long hey you come home good a squirt of that cuz you feel better from [Music] and it seems like a good thing to I get do cuz you can hide it like you know like some people say Oh going home to have a beer and if you didn't want people to know that you like drink beer you can not say it or um somebody that did this well yeah like somebody calls you oh I'm just having a piece of a chocolate bar see they wouldn't even know which seems pretty smart thing to do my fingers there but oh well because that arm hurts like that's I said some sort of things are sensitive I still haven't had gotten the drink from before some really like I'm and this and then I'll get a drink and sit there with my blanket on and oh yeah like when you walk things too early like like you're walking I'm not saying you're not just like it's not it doesn't feel normal feels like it feels like a little better like they had a key bones in your legs you probably wouldn't feel the achiness okay so it's like now I'm going for real like you know what I probably do this again good thing I only ate one no Jumanji - oh okay may need to call night when one or something cuz you probably get really scared at one point wait I'm scared but I'm like oh like you know if the cops came I would just [ __ ] hide but like if you talk to you you wouldn't you'd be so scared you would even move where you are and then they you know no way you're in there and the house okay so why can't say into next time because what if there is no next time or like Oh smoking chocolate bar number two and Oh like have episodes smoking charcoal smoking another chocolate bar now I don't remember why I say mad cuz it's totally good [Music] I was talking about Chuck burn so like this should probably be a good night adios and I can tell you the area didn't you know country I'm in so nobody knows okay so I'm gonna go now and wonder if this is too close okay okay that's I'm done don't forget to like subscribe subscribe get your friends just subscribe get just subscribe and I like okay", "HBOaSjKZ8gA": "[Music] hello friends welcome weights the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and sorry for the view change here we're doing some rearranging here in weeks HQ and things should look back to normal again pretty soon so what are we talking about today guys we are talking about another edible and we are talking about our third product from the folks at Chiba choose this time we have picked up their strongest product they make to see if it's gonna do us the business or not so this is Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams it's about as good as you can get for Chiba choo and I'm kind of excited I never really I've tried to cheap and choose in the past both hundred milligrams found them a little wanting they were okay both of them they just weren't as good as other hundred milligrams and there they were kind of expensive for what they were however this 175 milligram cost me 20 bucks which is a little expensive but not too much more expensive than say a hundred eighty milligram chocalate bar or whatever but this is obviously less substantial than that from what I understand she Batu's is one of the more popular edibles I think they exist not only here in California but they're also in Colorado Washington there are hugely popular brand and they've been around for a very long time so they probably have a lot of brand recognition which is why they're probably so popular so as I said this is the 175 milligram version I like the back here it's got all the stuff you want to see it's actually got the lab testing batch it's got the nutrition information the ingredients all that fun stuff always happy to see it on any packaging that's available out there alright guys so let's go ahead and tear this open and see how this tastes if I remember correctly last Chiba 2 I had was a hundred milligram ER and it was not very good tasting so I'm a little afraid that this one might also be a bit delicious if I could even open it well guys that's something to keep an eye out for it is this packaging is it does have little tear slits but done they don't really work and that'll do it will just rip it to pieces okay so we have gotten our 175 milligrams chocolate taffy out and that is crazy to believe that's a hundred and seventy five milligrams of THC right there it smells terrible it smells like chocolate and bitterness oh here we go this is the hundred and seventy-five milligram Chiba choose deca dose extra-strength chocolate taffy Oh Oh God oh my god Oh oh good I wish I had some water on me Oh whoo well after Jason oh holy [ __ ] wow that is up there with the kirova salted-caramel blondie or the enjoy goldfish in terms of the worst-tasting animals I'm a rat that was disgusting I knew it was repulsive oh it was a tiny little package and it does have me optimistic though that that a tiny little package producing that much of it tongue twisting tongue turning vile taste result might actually be as potent as advertised so on taste you don't get much worse than Sheba choose extra-strength deca dose but we'll see about the potency and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours as I do with all our reviews or for you just wait a couple of seconds and we'll catch you right after the break thanks for sticking around see you soon the BAM we're back guys it's been two hours since I had Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams and it's definitely more potent than a normal Chiba chew but it's not quite as good as say a kiva bar or the Jose or a 4:20 bar I did not find it to be as good as that I am pleasantly hi ants in like a 6 but not where I hoped to do it been especially for how bad it tasted oh my god it is awful tasting guys it is who it is Dukey licious [Music] but it is a very small little thing and I always say I love small potent edibles and it's small and reasonably potent so that's a win in its category however I think this one costs roughly double what a normal Chiba chew costs and I'm not sure it's I feel twice as high as and almost you at you maybe it's hard to say I don't think it charts linearly you know I find what I'm saying highs higher high as in a linear relationship it's uh it's exponential maybe I don't know actually I don't know what the what the shape of the curve of a high is boy um this is not chiba choose that's making me talk like this this is exhaustion i have been up for i was looking at my watch which i dont even fun yeah I've been up for 25 hours right now so that's part of the reason I'm acting a little crazy but I am looking forward to this Chiba choose ability to hopefully let me get some a salamba because that is where I am headed to next to fairyland dreamland yeah if not fairyland dreamland boy oh boy if I had it and if I ever edited these that would this would be quite a job but I'm not going to so I'm sorry you guys alright guys but before I go and maybe cuz I'm just feeling tired and making you know being tired makes you feel a little pessimistic I want to share with you guys my cherry on top which is a terrible way of pitching that idea let me tell you something's gonna you feel awful no I want to share with you something might my cherry on top which is sort of how I should have started saying this something that I love to watch or do or read or see or whatever the case may be that is unrelated to weed that I want to share with you guys just a little something extra that I can tack on these reviews that hopefully you guys will enjoy and this review I want to share with you and this is why I said it's gonna be a downer this is why I said being tired might have influenced this but I saw in the bookshelf and I it's it's phenomenal it's it's another it's another game changer it's another one that will shift your thinking and thinking and that is the sixth extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert not Colbert but Cole Burke I think it is a book about mass extinctions and how there have been five mass extinctions throughout life's history on earth five times where what life was nearly wiped out and evidence suggests we are currently in the sixth one of those it's really good and and really well-written and and just a gripping read and it's short to like 250 pages so get on it guys I normally I'm not that forceful and I'm not that forceful about this one but if you if it sounds interesting oh my god I've been going on for four minutes and 15 seconds sorry but that does sound interesting yeah give it a shot I think you guys think you're gonna enjoy it it is pessimistic however I don't know if there's I can't remember if there's any optimism if there's any light in that book what am I talking about oh I am looking forward to some sleep hopefully provided brought to you by wherever the G Batu's wrapper is all right guys I am so sorry it took so long to spit all that [ __ ] out to anybody who's out there still listening thank you so much you're really kind for making the end of this one I not even I want to make it to the end of this one and I'm the one speaking have a wonderful day guys we'll check you out on the next review thanks so much for watching weeds we'll see peace", "nCS18uzZfWE": "hi guys i'm going to eat some wait i am going to eat some a big

don't know who but Cheers hmm 100 milligrams of THC tune-up real [ __ ] good Sam are you chewing up the bagging case to be a Joe in it we pitch our winterized he definitely did some beer chilling it now oh yeah", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "515GSjc9Tvo":

CBDs then be my guest I'll be right back in an hour and update you on how I feel in the meantime okay bye see you later whoo hi okay so guys it has been an hour and a half exactly an hour-and-a-half 90 minutes so I started taking the CBD gummies at 11:50 okay I started feeling it a hundred milligrams I started taking that I started feeling it now actually I took the gummies I took the gummies at 11:50 a.m. and the whole pack 100 milligrams and then I took the syringe the syringe thing a hundred thousand five hundred milligrams after that and then five minutes at 11:55 I started feeling something and then starting at 12 o'clock is when I did my fashion Nova I'm bagging video and it just was like I just felt like I was doing too much like I felt like I was just doing too much and I was just I wanted to talk more and be more lively like more like this like you know who I am right now I don't I think I'm just more like mellow and just like thinking like what the heck is going on I don't know I didn't even see the video yet but when I post it you know obviously you can check it out check it out if you want you don't want to that's fine but it was just like I felt like I needed to like lay down and just relax and stuff like that as for pain management I feel like it could do it's like could do pain management thing I you know I took like 1600 milligrams so I personally didn't have any pain really but I don't want to give myself pain so I don't want to give myself pain to just see if I could remove the pain so I just documented how I felt so is that it it could get taken to effects up to ninety minutes I guess it depends so for me it took an effect anywhere from five to ten minutes that's how fast it's such an effect for me with the light breakfast a couple hours before so it's like two hours before I had breakfast and then I took this and then I did feel something I hated I hated this syringe I really hated this this tastes disgusting I'm still have it in my mouth like the flavor it's like an earthy and earthy licorice I hate licorice I really hate it I'll never get that syringe again but um thousand oh but I do like the gummies even though it melted I really did enjoy it and that was it it's been an hour and a half and it said it should last for eight hours after this I guess I don't know I feel okay you know I'm still here I've been taking that much I'll you know like I thought I was taking too much I was scared if you see before but I'm better now so guys I survived 1,600 mgs of CBD edibles and I feel ok I feel good after an hour and a half I go back to normal I guess towards the hour mark I started to feel normal so let's say five minutes I started to feel something then 10 minutes hit me from 10 minutes to 30 minutes or so maybe 40 I was just like in like this height of the moment and then like after the hour mark I started winding down from feeling a certain way and then an hour and a half I'm back to where I was before and it's supposed to be still in effect so like I said if I had any pain I guess I could give me more like information but I don't so I guess if I have pain I pray I don't but if I ever do I

wondering why I've got this Nutella in front of me and that is not because I've switched over to reviewing non marijuana edibles that's just because I'm taking this as a vessel for fat because I'm looking at another gummy today I'm looking at the cushy punch TKO 200 milligram lime flavored gummy edible I don't know if you can see it that package is a little shiny so it might not show up on the camera there on the back we've got some nutrition information oh and guys real quick as well this is one of our week's minis where instead of our customary 30 60 and 120 minutes I just come out to you the initial time and after 2 hours to let you know how we're feeling so first things first when it comes to gummies I always like to have a little fat first and I like to have a little fat I like to have a little Intelli so I'm just gonna take a nice little lick I wish delicious Nutella yum yum and now that I've got some fats in my body I feel more comfortable with taking this and this is a surprisingly potent edible this is so small and they proclaim it's 200 milligrams I've never been a fan of gummy edibles I don't think they've ever been as effective oops but I do think they are more effective when you are when they are consumed with us so here we go here is what the edible the looks like right there we'll try to open this up oh wow it is very plain-looking it is just like a green shot of jello smells a lot like marijuana smells a hell of a lot like weed probably even opening this up you'd get caught because it smells so much like weed a little difficult to get out and there we have it for tiny little squares and apparently this is 200 milligrams THC I say we shall see here we go down the hatch all at once oh oh that is bad oh it tastes they say lime it tastes just like marijuana except in a gummy version and that flavor is sticking around oh that is vile yeah let me do a little bit more fats Thank You mysterious camera person mm okay that's better you get that nasty taste in my mouth I hope it's going to be worth the anguish because this is a 200 milligram edible they say it's won some kind of award and the bud tender recommended it very highly and for something so small it was quite expensive at ten dollars so I mean I've got high hopes even though it isn't gumming I will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know if those high hopes are validated or not thank you so much for watching we'll see you soon it's been a bit of 90 minutes welcome back to wheats I know I said I'd check back in about two hours but it's only been about 90 minutes and the reason I'm here early is because the experience sort of already peaked and is fading I'm actually kind of already pretty much done sober which is unfortunate men what a colossal disappointment the cushy punch TKO is it's expensive it tastes like [ __ ] and it doesn't get you high at all that is three strikes and you are out uh cushy punch TK arrow more like a big cushy punch TK no thank you hard pass woof-woof-woof if you see the sound of dispensary near you just a boy and I'll cost grab anything else this is gonna do nothing for you except thin your wallet well that's thank you so much for watching wheats sorry that we had a disappointment on this review but hopefully we've got better product around the corner thank you so much for watching okay catch you guys next time",

rolls and I got 82 starbursts well I had 82 starbursts now I have a sugar rush and a pile of trash but this first hack turns this trash in into fashion my favorite candy bar belt for this hack you'll need a tape measure scissors clear packaging tape to keyrings and starburst wrappers trim your candy wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "Rasb-rz1Hts": "- I love pot but, the people\nthat are making edibles need to slow the fuck down. (audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you. (laughing) Like a person, not like a\nfucking deer, a woodchuck, they look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I\nthought I was gonna die. (laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's. I don't know what that means,\nbut if you say it right, and don't fuck up the\nwords, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. (laughing) (funky music)", "B85BiCgfHhk": "hey guys it's real welcome back to my channel today I'm hanging out with my sister well everybody I am so excited because today's video is super special it is a first for us we are celebrating and making a recipe for Mother's Day and it's special because this is gonna be the first Mother's Day that's not just for our mom anymore yeah this is Molly's

I can't believe it our family is going I'm so excited about it and I really wanted to make a yummy recipe to celebrate Mother's Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like what it's like to be a mom now I have so much respect for all moms out there I am so obsessed with Grayson like he is probably the best part of my day waking up like seeing a smile and cuddling with him and just seeing him name seeing him grow every day and learn new things it's it's the coolest thing he's so cute he's so cute how does mom life is it like like like tell me about it well you don't sleep you really don't okay it's been an adjustment but you just you get used to it learn how to function on a lot less sleep yeah that's right that's what you're doing and that's why you deserve a delicious Mother's Day treat that's right so this Mother's Day if you're not making her one of these do something nice for Mom she'll call your mom say thank you yeah cuz now mo knows how much work it is to raise a little baby and it's a lot of work okay baby Grayson is taking a nap right now but can we see him when he wakes up yes all

gummy bears yeah okay oh my gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can still yummy used even though it's such such such a small amount of Rosie that's actually in it you know him you still get the flavors of it which is delicious most favorite all right mo let's pop the rest of these out and then that let's make some other flavor yeah we have like red wine white wine and a rose a we can make some extra for Mamma Mia our Mamma Mia oh she

and remember if you ever want to make these non spirited you can just replace the wine ingredient with any fruit juice like you could make these with grape juice yeah like a dark grape juice or a

different flavors and I'm gonna show you how to make these hi everybody today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears make with these cute little gummy bear trays I got these off of ebay and I'll leave you the link below it comes with even this little dropper so you can put it in there easy we're gonna make three different flavors so the first one we're gonna make is blueberry wait 1/2 a cup of blueberry puree I just warm them up a little bit some frozen berries and then I blended them in my blender and it makes perfect PRA like this okay so we're gonna warm up in a saucepan the blueberry puree 1/2 cup and you add 1/2 a cup of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice so I was just gonna blend this up and then we're gonna add the honey when you need 2 tablespoons of the honey like that we're just gonna melt this together really nice and then we're gonna add the gelatin right now I need to add the 3 tablespoons of gelatin and just kind of spread it around so it doesn't clump up in a spot okay just mix that up until it gets kind of glossy and all the Delta mix is off okay this one looks ready okay now we're gonna make an orange juice flavor orange one so we're gonna use a cup of orange juice and one tablespoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of honey and stir that up and now we're going to add the gelatin again three tablespoons of gelatin and stir that up till it's dissolved and it's nicely coat it together and it should look a little bit glossy so just cook it up for a little bit okay that one's ready now we're gonna do the last flavor we have strawberry all right we put the strawberries puree in there half a cup of water a tablespoon of lemon juice and again two tablespoons of honey okay on three tablespoons of gelatin that's it stir it up really good let it cook up to dissolve all the way okay that's it now I let the three flavors cool down okay I've got my trays ready I put them on top of cookie sheets so they won't be so floppy because we're gonna put them in the freezer so I'll just go ahead and fill up your flavors here I'm going to start with the orange one and I did not strain the pulp out of my oranges so we'll still have that in the gummy bears so if you want to strain yours that's fine but I did not okay now we're gonna do this strawberry too much okay okay now we're gonna do the blueberry okay if you don't have a gummy bear molds you can use any kind of pan as long as you line it I got it's a wax paper and then I'll the wax paper you can pour it in there and then once they are cooled you can pop them out I'm just have so much left over I'm just gonna mix them together kind of make like a mixed berry now what we're gonna do is we're gonna put all these in the freezer and they have to freeze for about 30 minutes now if you didn't have a mold and you did it like this just let it freeze first and you could chop them up into whatever shape you want or if you have the molds that's fine you just pop them in just like this and the cookie sheet or if you don't have those molds you could use any kind of silicon molds that you have I have these ones silicones and I have these ice cubes I only have the silicone on the bottom I can't really show you now has silicone on the bottom so that they'll pop out so any one of these methods will work if you want to just try it ahead of time you don't have the gummy bear molds this you can try it like this and these I got on eBay like I said they were eight dollars and I'll leave the link in the description down below if you want to check these out they're totally a good buy so I these I got 200 gummy bears for seven dollars so that's pretty good and I came with their droppers okay so now we're just gonna put them in the freezer like this for 30 minutes and this is how they turned out we got the Stars and the leaves in strawberry and the blueberry flavor and these are the gummi bears whole pile of them here they're really small cute perfect size little gummies and then these are the ones that we had on the tree cuz we didn't have any cut out and I just cut them into cubes shape I'm they're perfect - they're really nice you could try any one of the shapes or if you have something else go ahead and try it and our favorite flavor was these strawberry ones here so let's you try it and tell me which flavor you guys like and like subscribe", "nFHpiBPmCns": "[Music] today I'm showing you how to make Prosecco gummy bears I'm gonna use regular Prosecco and then this pink Prosecco so that I'll have two different color gummy bears but regardless of color whether it's champagne Prosecco or cava the recipe is the same in a pot combine 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar and 25 grams of sugar get the pot on medium heat and bring the mixture up to a boil for one to two minutes agar needs to boil in order to gel properly so make sure it hits a rolling boil for at least a minute pull the mixture off the heat and at this point I like to transfer it to a smaller bowl to prevent it from cooling down too quickly next you'll need some gummy bear molds I just got these on Amazon they were really affordable and easy to find and place these molds onto a sheet pan this just makes them easier to move later then use a dropper this one actually came with the molds to stream the Prosecco mixture into the little gummy bear cavities [Music] place the gummy bears in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until firm oh now I'm just gonna repeat this whole process with the regular Prosecco so again 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar agar and 25 grams of sugar bring it all up to a boil for one to two minutes transfer to a small container and use a dropper to fill the gummy bear molds while I'm doing that I'd just like to take a minute to thank living gin for sponsoring today's video by using their egg our agar in this recipe we're able to keep these gummy bears which are traditionally full of gelatin completely plant-based if you're looking to replace gelatin and any of your recipes or are wanting to try out these Prosecco gummy bears check out the link in the description box below for where you can purchase the living gin agar agar that I'm using here there are also a bunch of recipes on their website as well as on their Instagram both of which I'll also link to and if you're feeling competitive and are interested in getting your recipes featured by them they recently started holding monthly vegan recipe contests where people vote for their favorite recipe so if you want to submit a recipe or you just want to go have a look at the submissions and vote then definitely head over to their website once the gummy bears are set up you can pop them out of the molds and serve one thing to keep in mind is that the texture of these gummy bears is a little bit less chewy than gelatin based gummies what I found helps to get that texture is just to leave these out to dry a little bit overnight on a wire rack something about dehydrating them a bit gives them that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] [Music] thanks again to living gin for sponsoring this video and if you

ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "RIMPb0wXPfM": "this is one gonna be there this is ten coming back and this is 1000 gummy bear oh no we loved one ooh 1000 mm mmm they smell good I feel like there are a lot more lollipops then gummy bears I think it looks a bit bigger now this looks like a thousand gummy and just kidding it's a camera trick and today we're gonna be mixing 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear hey guys it's wengie and gummy bear hugs today is another epic DIY day we are mixing 10,000 gummy bear and instead of making a giant gummy bear I'm gonna make a giant wee bit it's not really like a bear bear he's a panda bear that you know looks quite delicious because the Q's I'm also gonna show you a bunch of experiments hacks and DIY so you can do with gummy bear let's get started and go shopping safely we have social distancing let's get [Music] [Applause] like 19 of these we cleared out the store he need a hundred so we're gonna go to the next door there's two kinds of bags in this pie of 160 grams and holds approximately 70 gummies accounted this multi bag holds 90 gummies and it's 200 grams we have sixty five bags of dish with brings up a total of ten thousand four hundred gummies are you gonna do that no I already ate it you ain't 400 oh no no no maybe like 200 300 small packs are pretty easy to open I could just open them up and tip out the gummy bears these multi-path have to open the big path and each of the individual packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like them it is not to my liking I prefer lasers yuck where is my fisherman never tried a gummy bear below you have your own YouTube channel yes I do subscribe or I will do few lucky cooker you wanna try coming there anything is this friend no it's weird uh-huh you prefer the camera Oh No okay I'm out ah he's out too Haley's cats don't let go me oh you know what I need coffee okay finally [Applause] I just realized I have a gummy bear planned decoration because I just green light give me a thumbs up guys thank me for my efforts [Music] alright guys we did it a mountain of 10,000 gummi bears if I lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he was so cute before the guy was still really sticky I don't think Ari melted gummy sets really well now we know it's better to meet gummy from scratch his ear came out so well this is so heavy you left out for the week got on a diet and flat on his stomach bit me he ain't good abs it's kind of a bear shape let's peel him oh my god he's still kind of have a face [Music] he's actually very yes [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear we made out of mold we melted it all he came through I actually didn't know if this was possible when I started the video he is adorable slightly deformed but that's okay we love a unique bear and I wanted to make like a nice different rainbow color thing but it just kinda looks Brown this is a normal gummy bear and this is my giant 10,000 gummy bear bear how's it look guys it is time to eat my goat hey Matt yeah how long do you think he'll take you to eat is gummy bear I think you and making a bed for what oh if you can eat it in two hours I'll wash your dishes for a whole

recipe today is for a super yummy sweet snack however you guys want to call it and it's the recipe to make gummy bears or gummies in this case i'm going to be making bears i already made these orange flavored ones they are super cute look but all you need are two ingredients plus water so it can't get any easier than that with halloween this year i have no idea what to expect i don't know if kids are going to be allowed to go trick-or-treating or not but it's always nice to have things to keep them happy at home to make it special for them so these are super fun it's an activity you can do with your kids not dangerous at all and as an option in mexico we have these uh sweet and sour gummy bears and also these uh spicy ones which we like a lot so i'll also give also give you the extra ingredients so you can prepare them with the extra flavors in case you like them the ingredients you need to make your gummy bears are 85 grams of any flavor jello that you choose seven grams of natural gelatin three quarters of a cup of cold water and the optional ingredients are vitamin c powder and chili powder tahin okay so before we get started um you need 85 grams of any flavor jello you want that's up to you guys whichever flavor you like whichever brand you like i'm using jello i like jello a lot but there's tons of really good brands so the brand and the flavor is up to you this particular box is already the 85 grams but they make in many different sizes this big one is 170 these little ones are 25 when i made these orange flavored gummies i used three packages of this one plus a bit more i just had to weigh it so it's not really an issue if you can't find an 85 gram sized box just weigh out your your jello and get until you reach the 85 grams you need for the natural jello what you do is these boxes usually have four envelopes of seven grams each so it's basically one envelope or one tablespoon of um natural flavored jello that's the equivalent so all you need is one envelope from this box and and and let's see oh yeah the the mold you need to make your gummy bears usually these molds are quite flexible so you have to put them on a plate otherwise when you try to transfer them to the refrigerator it's a bit tricky because it folds over and all the liquid will come out so just you need a plate if you don't have a mold don't stress you can use your ice cube tray which i made a few so you could see just don't fill it up to the top they're going to be thinner they also look nice i mean it's up to you guys what you have at home no need to worry or spend money um ice cube trays obviously come in different shapes i also have this other tray that's for jelly beans but you can also make the gummy bears in this shape and they look really cool and well basically that's it now to start the recipe what you need to do is you're going to pour your three quarters of a really cold water in a pan in a saucepan and then you're going to put your natural jello in there don't turn the stove on just let it rest for about three minutes after the three minutes you can turn your stove on at a low medium heat and you're going to start stirring you want it to dissolve well the water gets a bit less foggy it looks a bit more clear don't let it boil you just need the heat so it really dissolves once you see that the water is a bit more clear you can add your flavored jello in there and you keep stirring until it seems that it's all fully dissolved you just need it to dissolve you don't need it to boil you don't need anything extreme in heat just let it dissolve and once that happens you can turn it off you're going to let it rest for a while but while it's still warm otherwise what happens with jello is it gets hard as soon as it gets cold so you don't want it to get cold just let it cool down very slightly and then we're going to start transferring to our mold [Music] okay so um i let this cool down for about one or two minutes tops i just didn't want it to be super hot but it does have to be hot otherwise it starts getting solid and of course this needs to be liquid so that you can fill up your gummy bears or whatever mold you're using for your for your gummies um this particular mold was quite cool because it comes with this dropper so you can fill it in quite accurately you make less of a mess but you can use i often tell people with the recipes i don't want you guys to feel like like you need to buy something you can use whatever you have at home whatever type of molds you have maybe you can use a syringe a cooking syringe or a spoon or a measuring cup anything that you think will work for you use that so now what we're going to do is um oh before i forget if you feel that this is starting to get hard just heat it up a little bit and it'll melt all over again so that has a solution now what we're going to do is we're going to start filling up our gummy bears and then from there once we fill up the whole mold we're going to put it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes passing the 15 minutes you can take it out and you just push them out super easy they don't stick at all you don't need to grease this or anything they come out super easy if you're not using one of these flexible silicone molds all you do is with a toothpick you go around all the outside and then just pop it out it'll come out easily it's a very easy thing it doesn't stick passing the 15 minutes once you take all your gummies out you just fill it all over again and you keep doing that until you use up all your gummy bear mix [Music] okay so our gummies are done um i'll show you guys again i made some of with the leftover that i had i used the ice cube tray and made these cute little squares um but here's the other option i mentioned in the beginning of the video if you want to make sour gummies or sour spicy gummies they're not really spicy for those of you who don't know what tahini is this is the pocket size version like for when you go to picnics it's usually a bigger bottle but i ran out so i'm using my little ones this stuff is not spicy it's actually quite nice because it gives you this explosion of flavors in your mouth in mexico we use it a lot on you press some lime juice on your food and some of this stuff and it's magic so now going back to the gummy bear theme um what you do is i bought vitamin c in powdered version and it comes in these little packages i open one and i put it in a little bowl if you can't find the powdered version that it's too difficult here in switzerland you can also find these that are kind of like alka-seltzer so you put them in water and they just fizz up and dissolve you can just crush it with the hammer or anything until it turns to fine powder so that you can put it on your gummy bear and what i do is you can either put them in here and just grab a gummy and coat it with the vitamin c super healthy and then it ends up all coated with the powder it looks quite nice let me show you these would be the sour gummies or what i did in the other bowl is i did a mix of vitamin c with tahin there's no exact amount you guys can just add as much as you want and again we grab a gummy bear and we coat it this is just here to show you for the video if you want to be super fast and super practical just put a bunch in a ziploc bag or in a tupperware with a lid add the powders in there shake them and all your gummies get coated at once but here for the video i thought i would show you like this because it seemed a bit more practical but this would be the tahin version which is just slightly a bit more flavor but not spicy at all so kids will enjoy it just as an as an idea to put on the table the nice thing about making your own gummies is it's not just healthier but let's say you have a party for adults or for kids you can make the gummies in absolutely any shape you want so if you have a lego party you buy lego molds and you make lego gummies if you have a princess party you make them in little crowns if you have an adult party a naughty party i don't know you pick the shape and you make them whatever shape color flavor you want so that's pretty cool i like that a lot i hope you guys enjoyed the video and i'll see you in the next one", "0X5fqRx_ppc": "hey guys and welcome back today we're making some homemade fruit gummies these are all-natural they can be made with fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon bye girls", "CYHTDnsuZGY": "ready for a fun simple treat for you and the family let's get started today we're going to be making one of my favorites gummy bears but wait we can't have gummy bears on keto correct not so fast today we're going to make something that is super simple and it really only requires three simple ingredients all right so the ingredients we're going to need real simple today i went down to walmart and picked up four of the sugar-free flavors of jell-o it's really all you need when we make this recipe keep in mind i'll put the macros at the end but 20 calories absolutely zero carbs three proteins per and that's going to give you about 25 gummy bears per serving you can get the molds and amazon i also picked up an additional mold for the gummy worms those are just a little bit extra fun so all right to get started we're going to go with a quarter cup of water in the pot we're going to bring it to a slow boil now one of the things i told you is that this is super simple we're going to go with two simple ingredients i'm going to start off with a little bit of the sugar-free orange and just pick you up a packet of unflavored gelatin that's really about all you need bring it down a little bit so we don't we don't burn it out but that's really all you need i'm going to bring this in and let's get started start by putting in our one packet of our gelatin and then we'll put in our one packet of orange stir this in and you're going to want to go until everything is fully dissolved okay now that we've got our jello completely melted we're simply going to take an eye dropper that we we got with our molds and we're going to start filling the molds it's that simple [Music] okay so as you can see the one box gave us about 35 gummy bears and gave us an additional three of the gummy worms now keep in mind we said a little bit earlier and we'll put the macros out uh shortly after this but for all that we just made for the 35 or so gummy bears and the and the worms you're talking uh pretty much zero carbs on any of this stuff it's a great fantastic substitute for when you have that sweet tooth or for when you're just wanting to have something a little bit different like a gummy bear we're gonna go ahead and fill up the rest of these and once we're done i'll be right back [Music] as you can see we're starting to wrap up what we have um and we've made quite the load of uh quite a load of gummy bears um this is going to be an actually a fantastic treat to have but i'll tell you what so we talked a little bit about um what we can do for these and how we can snack now it's time for the real talk okay guys so we've finished our first recipe we've got some good gummy bears now the part that we're going to talk about here is going to be the real talk about keto so you're going to see a ton of recipes and a lot of them are going to sit there and say that they taste just like the real thing i don't want to break your heart they don't taste like the real thing and so many of you noticed it's just gelatin and jell-o sugar-free jell-o and so many people want to look at that and say well what you basically made is you've made jell-o shots or jell-o bears or jell-o gummy bears or whatever you want to call it just sugar-free and you're not wrong and so this kind of goes into the keto mindset about how you've got to look at your food a lot of the things you'll see on the keto diet are going to be very similar to some of the foods that you eat but not exactly the same and the reason being is that we don't use a lot of the same ingredients that are in a lot of the foods and i give a really good example what we make today has literally zero carbs you can eat these things until your heart's content you're talking about 20 calories per serving of about 25 that's an entire handful and by comparison i'm going to show you something that i think is very interesting [Music] that right there when i went to go pick up our gelatin and the jell-o sugar-free jell-o at the store today i ran across as i was getting some himalayan salt which is another great keto staple there was a a little container of sugar-free gummy bears and it was kind of unique because that's what we were making today now as part of that one of the things that we had seen was that a single serving um 200 i'm sorry a single serving is 47 carbs 47. and out of that 170 calories and 5 protein but 47 carbs if you're really starting to look at it and this is where the the uh the product type and the serving size start to come into play this container was literally maybe a little bit bigger than a tuna can for some comparison and it said that in that container there was nine servings so i can tell you that before i started keto i could eat the entire container not a problem it's not that much it was probably three handfuls of gummy bears now what they did say on the label was a serving size was eight gummy bears so for eight gummy bears you've got 47 carbs 5 protein and 170 calories and so i look at that and i go okay so what am i really getting in real life food and so what you're really looking at is if you break it down you are getting about 211 carbs 765 calories and 22 protein that's what you're going to get if you eat just half of it and that's really kind of typical of the standard american diet and so when we start looking at things for keto and you start looking at how you revise the way you think about food the jello gummy bears make perfect sense you can have them they taste pretty similar to gummy bears your taste buds are going to change and they're going to acclimate to some different things but you're going to be able to go in and actually have something that you can take to the movie theaters when they open again um you're going to be able to take them outside you're going to be able to give them to your kids for snacks they are sugar-free and they're just a great alternative for when you really want something for the sweet tooth so really look at the gummy bears as something that is an alternative to what you used to eat and that's what's really important about this recipe it's not that it's a simple two ingredient recipe where you're using a little bit of water some gelatin and some jello and that's not what it's really about what it's really about is revising the way we think and revising the way we eat and how we view how we view food and so if i can have an option of having 50 i'm talking a big old bowl of gummy bears that taste like it and i hit and run the refrigerator sometimes i'll grab a handful of these things out of a ziploc bag or container and i know that i'm only getting 20 calories and zero carbs it's perfect i hope you enjoyed this video hope you enjoy the real talk it's the honest talk i'm still fairly new at keto we've been doing it now for about five six months and so we're learning every day and i hope you continue to stick with us and i hope you do the journey with us take care", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using

We're gonna sample them, guess them and discover, something amazing. - But before that we're gonna tell a 10 word story. - If. - Dennis. - Suspects. - Martha. - Of. - Marination. - He. - Won't. - Ever. - Love. - Oh, man. That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life. I had a neighbor once whose husband died, his name was Dennis\nbut I never knew Dennis 'cause he, he dies before I knew him. - Dennis? - Yeah.\n- I'm not close with a Dennis. - Her name was Bunny by the way. I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay.

Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels. So it's a lost ad.\n- Or maybe you should try we got one right here is\nmarinated in Italian dressing. - Italian dressing (high voice). - [Stevie] I do remember my\nmom having like a Danielle, Danielle steel--\n- These are good. - [Stevie] On the bedside table. - I don't know what they are marinated in, but they are good. It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about.

I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh.

Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there. (background laughs) I'd like to know how big\nthat hat is before I buy it. - Yeah. Usually you can\njust, you can hang that up. You can hang that up, man. - It says in EX. Vintage Cactus Cooler\nsoda mesh trucker hat in EX, unused condition. It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick. (laughing) It's a cute cat. - Every cute chicks out there-- - It's a cute chick hat. - Go get this Etsy hat. - Vintage Cactus Cooler soda hat on Etsy. - I can't see out of my right eye. - Get it, get it. Orange pineapple soft drink is what the Cactus Cooler is flavored. Let's get rid of this, we don't like it. (clattering) Is that it? That's the discovery. Cactus Cooler exists. - Dr. Pepper makes it. - Is that right? - And Keurig, what? - Keurig Dr. Pepper. What does that mean? - [Stevie] Did you get\nsomething in your eye? - Yeah, water. (background laughs) - Yeah, Keurig Dr. Pepper, formerly Keurig Green Mountain and originally Green\nMountain Coffee Roasters is a publicly traded\nAmerican beverage company. - Keurig is Dr. Pepper.\n- As of 2018, Oh gosh. The newly merged conglomerate\nalso sells sodas, juices and other solid drinks via it's Dr. Pepper Snapple division also called Dr.\nPepper 7up incorporated based in Texas. - They make 7up. Keurig makes it. I want a 7up pod. - [Announcer] Make your\nshowers more mythical with the Rhett and Link\nshower curtain and towel set. Available now at mythical.com.", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "xGBPnDbSRxA": "hello everybody welcome back so today we're making some vegan gummy bears which means that these are going to grow us but they don't use gelatin so if you're vegan or if you don't need gelatin for any other reason this recipe is perfect for you so let's get started so you want to pour some juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add some powdered agar which we are going to be using in place of gelatin and simmer for one minute then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge until set for about 20 minutes so you can just use juice as in or you can add some coconut milk to the juice and it gives you like this obviously like delicious coconut flavor but it also lightens the color of the juice so it's not like a pastel color that's an awesome option or route to go down I googled and try to see if we going with vegan and the answer I got was it isn't so that's why I didn't use any food coloring in this recipe so yeah so if you want to add coconut milk what you want to do it for the juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add the powdered agar and simmer for one minute and then add some coconut cream and mix until it's fully combined if you don't want to use coconut cream you can always use almond milk then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge in full set for about 20 minutes then just unmold the gummy bears and you are done net so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe if you would like more vegan recipes definitely comment what specific recipe you would like down below and I will get on that ASAP and make sure to stay tuned until next Tuesday because we are making a fidget spinner recipe and it's so cool I'm actually making it today so haven't made it yet but it's gonna be really cool so make sure to stay tuned and I love you guys so much and I hope you have a fantastic weekend thanks", "lkTLGySENVU": "Hi Bold Bakers! Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "KE5WwiRYCRs": "If you love gummy bears and\nyou like energy drinks too-- All right, man, you got this.

I'm Sofia and today I'm going to\nshow you how to make some edible slime. So I know slime is not normally edible, it's\nusually made out of, like, glue and stuff that you can't eat, but today, since\nwe're in a bakery, it's gonna be done edible! So first I'm gonna take like a\nhandful or two handfuls of gummy bears. I'm gonna put these in the microwave for\nabout 30-45 seconds and then we'll be back. So now that they are done in the\nmicrowave, I'm gonna mix it and you want to work a little bit quick just so it\ndoesn't harden and it you have to reheat it. It's turning into more of a liquified gummy bear. Be careful, it may be hot. I'm gonna add some cornstarch just so\ncould help the slime form. So you could mix it with a spoon or your hand. I\nprefer my hand because it could help mix. You're gonna want to add about three\nspoons total of cornstarch and you want to just mix it in so it would form. Be\ncareful, it still maybe hot. Okay, almost there. Again it's gonna get all over your\nhands. I'm gonna add my final scoop of cornstarch so now I have three scoops of\ncornstarch. Since this came out, like, a really ugly color I'm gonna add some\nblue. And you could always add edible glitter -\noh this is gonna get all over my hand! My gosh okay so once you get it you could\nlike kind of play with it and since it is edible you could even eat it! Tastes\njust like gummy bears! This may give you an arm workout, too, but\nit's okay because it's fun! It's like I'm pulling taffy! It feels like slime on my hands, it's\njust instead of slime that comes off your hands, it's the slime that stays on\nyour hands like for a really long time! Thank you guys so much for watching!

like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please

making gummy bears Kito gummy bears and these are awesome for whether you're a kid or an adult but I want to show you just how easy they are to make so I'm gonna have these guys do it you need gelatin and we like further foods gelatin because it's from grass-fed cows we're gonna use a tablespoon and a half in there bud so make sure it's nice and flat now some people said don't do that Kai some people said that they don't like gummy bears because they're too much just like jello they want more of a chewy gummy bear add more gelatin Oh half of that okay because gelatin if you let them sit overnight they're gonna get even chewier that's probably good and then we're gonna add about a tablespoon of water to soften this okay so you're gonna sift that in there well it's a flavor just a minute now I'm gonna add some hot water it's really hot getting you to gelatin mode you're gonna add about two more tablespoons can you stir that how's that doing good or is it getting all gel hard not speaking it's not sticking it all right looking good looking good and then what flavor you want I can already see a beautiful face you're gonna add about a tablespoon of that so pour that in here it depends on how sweet you want it obviously if you're coming from a sugar world you're gonna want more and this is just stevia and flavoring some citric acid okay well let's try that nope okay I did that mister that in there and what you could do is you can actually taste it to make sure you like the flavor now this is gonna be pretty thick compared to some of the things that you make should turn the stove off it looks like egg it looks like an egg it does and what you're gonna use I really I got this gummy worm thing and you're gonna pinch this and suck it on up and then fill it into one of the molds well that's because we we didn't really sift the gelatin super well mom make mistake so you have like a gel normally it's like because you have a piece of gelatin stuck in there hello like there we go it's like care of drill yes there we go see how it's coming up and then you have a dropper and you put it right on in there and these are really really delicious you want to fill it almost all the way so keep doing it oh yeah that's perfect and then we could do a different flavor once we fill those up and we got this I should have said one other thing you should put that on to like a cookie sheet so you can easily put it into the fridge so once that's all filled you're good to put it in the fridge for a couple hours if not overnight is better and then you get these beautiful little gummy bears you on trial on ooh yummy see how easy this is it's just it's waters an ingredient it's three ingredients otherwise it's two ingredients gelatin and Eberly and you can make it

hopefully this was the educational video if you liked it give it a thumbs up subscribe and as always thank you for watching and see you guys next let's go feed this to some people", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple.

And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the

take out the raspberry okay there's that and then what I have here this is the unflavored gelatin and a Kroger brand there's four packs to a box they look like this I have one more pack right here and then I have a whole new box so I'll be using that okay so I'm going to show you my molds I've got a little bit of a collection here these are for when I make keto fat bombs always use these they're small so they're not too big when it comes to the fat bomb so I'm just going to put those to the side because I won't be using those okay these let me start with these right here and these are just these tiny tiny gummies okay they're real small and I have a blue one orange one and a green one in these I've ordered all of this stuff gummy stuff off of Amazon okay now these are right here I'm ordering off Amazon these gummy bears are much bigger as you can see they're about twice the size probably and then they also have some gummy worms in there so those are cute so I have two of the sheets of those okay I've got some more things in here but they're more for fat bombs too like I have a jack-o-lantern then I have the little spoons these are fat bomber related so I'm just gonna leave those in here what I will need though these droppers these are what you use to suck up the jello in here and then it's so much easier to just get the jello in the little molds with these so also I got these right here at Dollar Tree okay it says they're ice cube trays they're pretty I don't know if I want to use them I'll make you like a test on one or two of these because they are kind of I mean they're not as these are here like really as you can see they're really and it's easy to pop the gummies out these are still you know there's still pliable but I don't know how good a gummy would pop out of these so I may try like one flamingo and then next time I make them on there if I like them or not so if if they don't work good for that I'll just use them as ice cube trays they are adorable so okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of water it ready and we'll get it in my pan I'm gonna change my camera angle and then we'll take it from there so I'll be right back okay guys I'm just put a fourth of a cup of water in here I've got the Stowe bottle on and I'm going to start out with orange so I'm gonna make this packet of orange jell-o in here okay pan quite big actually and then I'm gonna need this pocket a regular jello in here okay so what I'm gonna do is get these stirred up okay so I knocked my tripod over okay so hope you can see this yeah I'm getting this going it says to stir it says it'll thicken up a bit but the end whenever everything gets dissolved it will get thinner so that's what I'm going to do okay I got it up on half probably not the best idea in the world especially since this pans a little big anyway this is okay so yeah it does seem a little thick right now I've made this before it's been a while I can't really really remember I made it in a smaller pot though so play the better I'll be able to so sorry if you hear background noise okay it's almost there I just have to do it for just like a couple of minutes trying to get all this down through here I don't know why I grabbed this big of a pan I think I'll switch out forever for the rest of this what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna go ahead and get all of the jello ready and in a bowl and then I just don't know how I feel about this we'll see we'll see how this one turns out just because I don't know it's thick it seems really thick I don't remember it being that thick before so I'm just trying to make sure everything is dissolved it looks like it is so what I'll do is get this poured in a bowl and what I'm gonna do is put you on pause but I will be back when I have all four jell-o's made and sitting with my molds so I can show you how I'll fill them up and everything okay so I'm gonna put you on pause I'll be back with the jello in the bowls okay guys I'm back what I've done is went ahead and made the red and the orange and I want to fill I'm gonna fill these up and then I'll show you and then I'll go ahead and make the green and the yellow and then we'll do those next so I'm just going to have a variety so what I'll do is I'll produce insert some background music here and I'm just going to go ahead and fill these up without talking [Music] okay guys I made ultimate mistake there of not putting the gummy container here on a like a cookie sheet or something like that but this right here worked good I did not spill any if you just have like one of these little cutting container thing or cutting boards you can slide it right under if you forget like I did and just get it on the cookie sheet so what I'm going to do is go ahead and get another cookie sheet because I feel like I'm gonna need one more mold so I'm gonna get that one on the cookie sheet first and especially since I'm gonna do one tester of those so I'm up high just do like this one right here so I'll be right back okay guys I'm back I have made the lemon jello I have it ready for the molds I've made the lime jello also ready for the molds so what I'm going to do I got these I got this on a pan cuz I know I'm gonna need some more of these and I've got the Flamingo there so I can do the test one so what I'm gonna do is I'll probably put some background music on and just be quiet while I'm filling these up [Music] okay guys I have got everything filled up now so what I'm going to do is get everything in the refrigerator and when everything is nice and set I'll be back to show you how I get the mole or get the gummi bears out of the molds one thing I want to say is whenever you are filling up the molds the less bubbles that you have the better if I had a toothpick I prayed pop some of those bubbles I'm just gonna see if I can get some of these bubbles pop because it's just better if you don't have any bubbles in there it's a couple of bubbles but not a whole lot actually not a whole lot at all so I'm just better if you can't if you don't have them so okay and what I did I didn't have enough Millan left so I did a lemon lung flamingo so we'll see how that turns out we'll see if I'm able to get it out or not so anyway I will be back to show you the finished product okay guys I am back and I think that these are ready to be popped out so hopefully they are so what I'm gonna do is to show you how to do it see here they are they're all in here so basically what you do is turn these things inside out just like that push them right up through there what I'm gonna do I'm putting them all on this plate this so I can get a really pretty thumbnail see how they pop out perfectly you can see wherever the camera is Yam they're adorable so my whole family is kind of excited I'll have a feeling I won't get too many of my keto gummies but that's alright that's alright I'm anxious to see how the Flamingo one is going to come out just to see if it comes out good I may make like another batch of just like regular not sugar-free gummies for the family and they're a little bit bigger I feel like they'd be pretty good doing all the little tiny ones first they come out super easy they're things almost clean when they get out so it doesn't take a whole lot of clean up after and you can see they're so pretty and colorful bad boys I can do the yellow ones next they come out super fast okay there's those okay let me get the yellows I did not spray these molds at all I feel like spraying them would probably give a strange flavor maybe I didn't spray them I do feel like you don't need to I mean I don't know what kind of molds I'll have to see when I get to the Flamingo but and you can see like if they have bubbles in them this is basically I mean you can see the bubbles but you're gonna eat them anyway it's not really a big deal so hopefully the worms will pop out good this is actually the first time I've used the worm molds so I thought it'd be cool all right there's all of those go ahead I'm gonna go with for the worms first here's all of these so let's just see oh look at there pop boop boop you didn't fall on the floor thank goodness okay there's the worm I'm gonna put them around the edges there okay there's the yellow worm okay the swarms kind of attached to the other worm there's the red worm the strawberry worm and then we have our orange worm that came out perfect and glide about that now these gummy bears are a little bit bigger as you can see this facade of the other ones the size difference they're not too much but I made a row of all of those different colors well do the tops one thought I saw one go fine come on have a really pretty thumbnail with all these on here and then I got this jar here at Dollar Tree has a really nice tight fitting lid so I think I'm just gonna keep them in there usually I use like a mason jar with a lid so I don't know I may do the mason jar put a picture at the end on whatever I decide however I decided to store them after every all the family members get to get a try them they're not getting all of them them because they're not kedo i buy in my bag of gummy bears right right right right jack right okay so there's all of those that I'm gonna go for the single flamingos let's see here we go okay okay not good check it out came out excellent so what I'll probably do is just make a little put him down there let's just make a little a hopeful meet and try a flamingos my pregnant to use a couple boxes of jello just all in the same color maybe maybe that raspberry and then just make these because I do have one more well I only have one more pack of the unflavored gelatin anyway here are the Quito gummies adorable hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it please give me a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos like this and leave me a comment if you are going to make some of these bad boys there's a whole bunch of different flavorings you can use if you choose to use like the unsweetened jello and stuff like that so yeah like and you can use even T to make to make it my not sure how to do that I haven't done it before I'd like to try anyway why didn't answer okay guys thank you for watching I'm gonna put a video up picture up at the end on how I ended up storing these so

figure animations and post them on the internet justin also had a band he called the band mentally justin is now marine there's a lot of things that make up a person many different elements that come together to make the delicious core of who they are gummy bears are no different you can't just do one gummy bear flavor and expect to be the bee's knees you gotta do multiple you gotta do this you gotta do that you gotta do the other and you have to do it all with military precision today the albanese world's best gummy bears look to take the crown from haribo themselves and man it's gonna be good the only way that this game advances is by people being bold and people being brash and the only way you do that is to make a statement and man did all bananas ever make i love the arrogance dude i love the arrogance of the soul you're gonna have a hell of a pair of peach pits and a couple of large dangling mango seeds clacking together to make a call out like this the world's best hell yeah dude from a flavor perspective it appears the albany's gummy bears have already won with 12 flavors of theirs and only five from the hairy bow now okay you could say oh but you could do five flavors really well and twelve really badly you could but what this shows is a creativity and a moxie to really go out there and break the status quo dude i want it to be better show me how much better it can be i mean who wouldn't want a better version of the harry well i know i certainly do let's find out just how good it is and crack this bad boy in half hold the phone hold the phone before we even get into the actual chewing aspect of it bro already albanese is winning with the resealable package right there look at that i could just seal this puppy right back up and with the hairy bow i don't get that i do not get that same sort of a distinction that convenience that i like okay albanese you're getting the point for that that's nice we've got the haribo gummy bears on the left and the albany's ones on the right and you can already tell the size difference is is monumental i mean come on now hold the phone for a second there's no doubt about it the albany's packs a lot more gummy into their bears homeboys obese talking about major thyroid problems and all that of the smell though that's where really the difference comes in because you can smell a lot more fruit flavor coming off the albany's bears as opposed to the hairy bose ones where there seems to be a bit more of a i don't want to say a plastic taste but it's a lot more muted and subdued whereas the albany's ones are a lot more explosive and more in your face it's very pleasant but it goes even deeper than that with the textures themselves also being wildly different the albanese is a lot squishier a lot more gummier a lot more malleable that kind of thing i'm decapitating homeboy here i apologize with the hairy bow being a lot firmer and a lot harder as well now whether that results in a chewier chew or anything like that i think it's gonna result with the albanese right here being a lot more chewier but we'll see if that's a good thing but before we go ahead and have a taste i have to give a big uh thank you to today's sponsor this long-nosed dog be the person he wants you to be [Music] which well i guess would just be somebody who feeds him or something i don't i don't know but let's go and go and have a taste oh please i can hardly bear it my dude this is a very close match because they're both doing their own distinctive things the same albeit a bit differently the flavor of the albanese is way fruitier i mean like you can taste every inch of that fruit every piece of juice everything that's coming off that thing you get the full experience right then and there but the hairy bow themselves while they aren't as fruity they're also not as sweet which is where the albanese kind of has a little bit of a borderline problem because it's almost too sweet it's almost on the borderline where it's like you eat more than five or six of these things and you feel like you're sick to your stomach or something like that you know it's going in between that line but it doesn't quite hit it whereas the hairy bow you can eat as many as you want these things never get tired but the question is are these better are they better than the gold standard well yes you know what i'm going to go ahead and say yes now not because the flavor is so much better than theirs but really it's because of the amount of flavors see i can have a bunch of haribo bears and get something consistent and delicious every single time but the spice of life is variety and the fact of the matter is these are on the same level as harrybo but there's way more flavors to go around making them i guess by process of elimination they really are the world's best but i mean it's so close i know it can be a bit confusing like how justin's mom would let me hang out with them anymore because she said i was a bad influence whatever that means anyway tune in next time for my next review the anarchist cookbook [Music]", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "aeAwCMHrxP8": "[Music] what is up guys welcome to another video hey man for today's video man i have a bunch of gummies in here as you can see so we're gonna go ahead and try this thing out these gummies are special there are what you call edibles so basically this thing has a 50 milligrams of thc as you can see right there 50 milligrams of thc and uh so if you guys don't know what thc is so let me see thc or tetra hydrocannabinol is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the national institute on drug abuse so this gummies right here contains some kind of thc um so basically thc you will find out in a marijuana flower or a marijuana product so technically i live here in washington marijuana pot mary jane dahon whatever you call it it's legal out here as long as you have your state id and your uh as long as you have your state id actually and if you're 21 and up you can actually go to the store and get some marijuana but on this case i have this this is different kind of taking marijuana i'm not saying that i'm taking marijuana you know like i do this i do marijuana i do hardcore drugs no okay no this is a gummies so [Music] marijuana marijuana is so broad guys marijuana is so broad uh some people believe that it can cure cancer can cure illness it can cure epilepsies and stuff like that so they made a different bunch of products that have thc on it because they knew they thought that marijuana can help alleviate you know pain stress anxiety and some illness and you know some people can just smoke that [ __ ] you know some people cannot just smoke and feel the effect some people needs to drink it some people needs to have gummies like this to feel the full effect of the thc so in this case i have these gummies right so man i'll make another video on this marijuana thing okay so for today's video i just want to go ahead and test this out and uh see what will be the effects on me after an hour so basically this is just a gummy it's like you know it's like gummy worms but it doesn't shake like worms and it says here at the back activation time is 45 minutes cannabinoid edibles can take after two hours or more to take effect so that's just another warning but yeah man enough of the talk i'm gonna go ahead and try this thing out so i'm gonna go ahead and try whoops oh crap i'm gonna go ahead and try this mango flavor okay and then we'll see what will be the effects are right now i'm clear i just i'm good i just had water so i didn't i didn't have no alcohol i didn't no nothing you know and i've tried an edible before i would probably recommend edible than smoking on marijuana but enough of the talk let's go ahead and try this edible let's go ahead and try this up let's open this thing up come on it doesn't taste any let me get one of these shout out again to jj man thank you for this um thank you for the edible let's go ahead and try this thing out so i think 50 milligrams each for one of these um gummies so this the gummy right there that's the gummy that's it you know it's a regular gummy [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] hmm it's sticking in my my teeth alright so right now it's [Music] um right now it's 3 44. i know if you guys can see that it's just too bright but it's 3 44. man come on bro it's 3 45 right now probably don't see that but it's 3 45 so in about an hour so i would say about 4 45 i might feel the effect i don't know but we'll see and uh yeah man let's see what's going on let's see what's gonna happen [Applause] it tastes like mango tastes like gummies it actually tastes good but yeah let's see what's gonna happen and

it's 4 52. all right so i just ate this one an hour ago but i didn't feel any effect i mean i don't know i don't know i just didn't feel the effect um i'm not sure if it's 50 milligrams per one gummies so i didn't really feel the effect on this one so yeah i'm a little bit disappointed because you know i thought there was something on it i thought i was gonna feel it immediately but it's been almost an hour now nothing really happens nothing really changed i still feel normal i still feel the same so yeah i mean i mean it's worth a try and uh shout out again to jj for giving me those

thanks again for watching and i see you guys on the next", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one says Diego always says peace out and God bless Turkish work it [Music]", "gy47dkoOlU0": "hi I'm Shireen the founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you soon take care of have a good weekend and stay safe guys stay safe I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry", "dzEFMvnhH54": "hey i'm

make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down

time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight

"P_KArHdguG8": "What's the story behind gummy bears? How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

gummy review but i was requested by somebody to do a part two of girl girl let it grow but i couldn't find the gummies anywhere like i went to my local walmart two times nothing i couldn't find them so i didn't buy them because i don't really trust it anywhere else than walmart because that's where i got it i don't know where else to get i'm not gonna be searching everywhere for it because i am busy and i'm always doing something and i never have time for literally nothing like i'm barely recruiting this video and i already have two weeks of doing this that's how busy i am because i literally forget or i'm just busy but the gummies that i'm gonna try are called vita fusion beautiful hair with biotin so far from taking it for two weeks i really like it because i feel like okay when i was taking the girl girl letter girl i think that's how you pronounce it but i think that's how you pronounce it but when i was taking those like not a lot of hair was coming out of my hair and like for me since i have a lot of hair and curly hair i literally lose hair like every single time like every time i shower it's like a lot of hair coming down a lot and i was thinking the girls will let it grow that means like i felt my hair was healthy and not a lot of hair was coming out but with these like i don't know i feel like more hair comes out than usual i don't know if that's normal i don't know or maybe it's because i'm stressing right now it could literally be anything the vitamins that it has is c and e only two which i don't like because i like having a lot of vitamins when i think vitamins what does it even make sense but so far the length of it being two weeks um didn't really grow that much i don't know it really didn't grow that much in my opinion i'm gonna put the picture up right now to see if the good girl or not i don't know the girl or not but i believing that it didn't grow because i don't see something different but see i think that's it about the vitamins i mean i'm gonna be taking pictures every week even though i haven't took a picture this week i'll be taking pictures every saturday to see how much my hair oh yeah my hair is curly naturally this is my real hair my real hair i personally don't like my hair because it when i say that a lot of people are like oh my god i wish i had your hair girl you know the struggles of my hair you don't know the struggles like to get like this that's all i have for right now so i see you if there's another video series so this is part two of the first video this is part two this is my little update or whatever this is the update about beautiful beautiful hair gummies let me rate it first because let me tell y'all we know let me tell you guys everything and then i'm gonna rate it okay so in my opinion for one month because tomorrow's a month because i started taking on february 14 and tomorrow's march 14th but today i'm taking the video because tomorrow's monday i'm not gonna have time at all to do the video so i'm doing it today um for me in my opinion as it had been a month and i understand that it's a 50 days assignment and i'm doing 30 which yeah but um in my opinion it did not go that much as much as i wanted it to be as if being a month even though i know you're just like but it's just a 5 minute of 50 days well you guys probably won't say that better i know other people or like maybe i just need that but i don't know it being 30 days i feel like it didn't grow i mean it did grow i mean it did work like the gummies of course but it didn't grow as much as i wanted it to be for it being a month i don't know if you understand that or not and my hair is um not brushed right now because if you guys understand curly hair if you guys know curly hair is that when you brush it out or you straighten it or anything it's longer than when it is curled um i know my hair looks short right now it's not really that short but i wanted to not brush my hair because when i had took the picture i barely realized that my hair was not brushed and when my hair is brushed and when my hair is not brushed there's a different length so i wanted to compare the length of it being not brushed and when because when i took the picture it was not brushed and i didn't realize until yeah but i'll put the picture again like right now so you guys let me know if it did grow or not i haven't seen the picture but i feel like it didn't grow in my opinion well it did grow but not that much as i wanted it to grow i don't know if you know what i mean but yeah as my hair falling out in the shower i mean i would say it was normal like i wouldn't get that much and i wouldn't get that little it was completely normal like if i was not on anything it was normal and my rating for it's gonna be i would say a seven out of ten seven out of ten because it did make my hair grow but then as much as i wanted it to grow in a month i know this video is so lame and everything because it's mostly based on my hair and it's not the thing that i can like say or entertain but if there's any recommendations for any other gummies or anything you want me to try let me know in the comments so if you leave a comment down below i'll most likely get to it because obviously i see all my comments pop up if you guys want me to try sugar bear i'm so down and try sugar bear i heard like reviews about them and i want to see so that is it for the video let me give you guys a 360 of my hair so you guys can see the length and everything is my hair in the front and then [Music] period so that is it for the video um thank you for watching and you guys can give a subscribe or you guys give it a like or comment down below do whatever you want bye love you guys", "qMOFwO6hWgQ": "hey guys it's

my channel please hit that subscribe button I make 2 videos every week on food from scratch naturally and it had me home thank you so much for stopping by our farmhouse [Music]", "XK1PuIkrEk8": "[Music] d [Music] d hey girl hey what is up you guys it has been a minute since i've done a slime video with me not uploading much in december in general i didn't upload any slime videos in december i don't even know if i uploaded a slime video in november i probably uploaded one in october last time today i decided to come back with a fun slime video not just any slime video an edible slime video i did one of these also months ago so basically turn this candy into slime challenge last time we did three to four candies and today we're doing three more this is a fun little series part two today the candy that we're gonna be turning into slime is skittles tootsie rolls and gummy bears so let's get to it let's see how these turn out i get a little bit nervous about these just because edible slime is so so much more complicated than not edible slime also you guys i just want to mention i am very aware that my fire alarm battery needs to be changed i think it just went off yes it's annoying i'm so sorry you guys i get it girl i think it's annoying too okay so first slime we're gonna attempt to make is a skittles slime we have a skittles right here let me tell you we had to do some research for some of these because not always will candy turn into slime it's not always slimeable so alex behind the camera she actually separated all these by color i can't believe you separated all the skittles literally all of them it's an even amount it's an even amount for all the colors that is incredible that's a point for skittles because we've separated colors before in the past with different candy and a lot of times for some reason like the best ones like they have the least red or you know things like that which is kind of crazy but that's the tea guys so what you're gonna need to make these is sour skittles we're gonna need some cornstarch we're going to need a coffee grinder yes we're gonna need coconut oil and we're gonna need some marshmallows okay so we have our coffee grinder this is uh the mr coffee one and i believe we had gotten this for another video and video and we even bought the skittles and everything and then we didn't end up we got and then we ate all the skittles but uh we're gonna use it today so we got a coffee grinder okay so we're just gonna put our skittles in here one color at a time it's going with purple and then we're just gonna pop her in and then you just press down it's dust like in seconds we could use this to crush up hot cheetos too and stuff whoa oh my gosh this is a lot do not ever stick your fingers in this guys or anything electrical like this at all the fact that this turned it into straight up dust a skittle you guys i feel like skittles are you know that first crunch it's literally kinetic sand do you see that it literally looks like sand like kinetic sand crazy okay so now that our skittles are dust it's time to go on with some marshmallows okay in order to make our skittle slime i actually tested this a few times to get the perfect measurements because there was not really any measurements for this and also it really just depends on how much you're making so what ended up working for me was one coating the bowl with coconut oil and then i added marshmallows and to calculate the measurements for that the bowl is a medium size and i filled up about a fourth of that cut those in the microwave for 10-15 second intervals until it melted completely so once the marshmallows were done and melted i also went ahead and each time i went in with a different color i pulverized them again since it's sugar it starts to solidify and kind of like bind together so i pulverized it again and then mixed it into my marshmallow mix got in there with a fork a spatula very sticky situation with any type of slime making whether it's edible or not you're gonna get your hands dirty and then you go in with some of that cornstarch and then it starts to come together like a slime so i started adding in cornstarch a little bit at a time and started to come together also adding cornstarch to your hands to the countertop to the parchment paper whatever surface you're working on is great and then adding a little bit of coconut oil to your hands helps it to not stick so much knead it up and you're good to go say if you want to put it in the fridge for another day you can actually store it into a deli container or anything airtight is good then you can go ahead and just take that out put it in the microwave for five seconds at a time until you get that soft smooth slimy texture it's also a very thick consistency so this would definitely i can't see this sticking to kids as long as you put some cornstarch on their hands and some coconut oil i feel like this definitely is very very manageable [Music] they actually still feel warm which is great they still feel very puddy like even in the containers these look so good if i was just looking at this i would straight up think that their butter slime i just want to show you when i poke into it so pretty i also think this is my favorite one because it smells like lemon heads you guys you guys oh you guys look how cute oh my gosh well since i made this with my hands i think it's safe to eat so let's try this out wow you actually cannot taste the marshmallow straight up skittles and they're sour too next up we're gonna be making tootsie roll slime and i'm really excited about this one one because we could just throw the whole thing where i gotta go you know we're not making five different colors i feel like that's what took so long with that one so this is actually a very very simple method and if you watched my last video of turning candy into slime this is a similar method to the bubble gum tootsie rolls are so underrated i feel like they're so underrated and i only see them during halloween we love her we're popping this bowl in the microwave this is probably the easiest one here that's all you do guys anything taffy i feel like usually is very very very stretchy so this should be a good one let's pop this in the microwave for about 10 to 15 second intervals until we have it nice and dough-like okay so after about 45 seconds you can see that it's very dough like oh it smells this smells so good you guys i'm sure my entire house right now smells like candy so soft this literally feels like brownie batter in slime form also the gloss the gloss so an option for sticking is some cornstarch or coconut oil also if you don't have cornstarch you can use powdered sugar but it's really it's the same thing oh my gosh that looks perfect it literally looks like brownie butter slime like slime are you kidding that is the easiest candy slime i've ever made 45 seconds and it smells incredible okay this stretch unbeatable okay skittles really could never i mean i love you skittles but tootsie roll like are you kidding okay this is crazy soft i don't really even need the cornstarch anything it smells so good it just melts so easily but it stays warm it's like you could play with this endlessly this is like the perfect taffy consistency for an edible slime this is probably the one i would recommend out of all of these if you want to just make one that's like really easy and you want to impress your kid and just be like look at this we're turning this into slime like nothing so effortless literally the only way i could describe this is if you magically turn brownie batter into slime that's exactly what it feels like so stretchy for quite a bit it looks like it's gonna take a while to cool down also if you're making these of course you know like you're making them so that you eat them so you might not need batches like this you might need smaller batches if you're just making them to eat them with your kids or you know something fun this is really cool guys tootsie rolls really recommend these last but not least we're making gummy bear slime i'm really surprised that i've never made gummy bear slime before because i feel like gummy bears and content is like a thing in my last video i was able to make clear edible slime with sour patch kids so i'm assuming that this should also be able to make clear slime there is some gummy bear slime recipes where you make them with powdered sugar but the only thing about that is i feel like gummy bear slime should be clear so we're gonna pop these in the microwave for 10 to 15 second intervals just as we have been doing mix them in between until we have a nice melted slime and then we'll go from there parchment paper down coconut oil this helps it from not sticking to the surface and also it'll help with being able to actually control it in your hands okay 45 seconds in they're starting to melt oh wow this looks really good oh wow okay melted melted melted it is definitely a little hot right now to manage but i could tell that it's gonna be a good one i'm gonna let it cool down first though because you don't want to burn ourselves i'm gonna let it cool down a little bit it is it honestly doesn't really even feel that hot it actually goes like a massage it feels so good it's kind of giving me lava vibes almost this is definitely slime i don't know if i put too much oil but it's not like binding as much but look how crazy this is i mean the stretch is endless okay this is crazy stretching right here that's a lot of stretch all right guys that's it for this uh candy slime challenge you know what my favorite one hands down was a tootsie roll it took 45 seconds to make literally and also it was the stretchiest one it smelled like freaking brownie batter i know it's tootsie roll smells like chocolate but it just felt like what literal brownie batter would feel like slime form the tootsie roll was also the cleanest it wasn't messy at all i needed barely any cornstarch i learned that the clear gummy bear one was really easy as well but you still gotta sacrifice the stick a little bit it is gonna be a little bit sticky because it's clear but it was also pretty fast i feel like that's more like a gooey experiment the skittles was really cool i loved all the colors i loved how it looked and felt like a butter slime but dang that one literally took a couple hours i like how all these kind of had like their own texture we got like a butter we got a brownie looking one and we got a clear all in all it was a success i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did make sure to click that like button comment down below if you were to want me to make more candy into slime girl then comment down below what candy you would turn into slime thank you guys so much for watching i love you guys and i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "vkcKRAfxGug": "hello everybody welcome back so today we are making a DIY giant gummy bear so I have been wanting to make one of these for ages and I finally found that coming barrel online which is like this hello if you want to pick it up and it's today we're making a raspberry flavored giant gummy bear this is so amazing I have also been a presence you turn this in at 285 cookie bear by sophie-anne vodka so guys mom like a big biggest Joel shot in the world anyway but let get started alright separate things first watch what I do is combine some jello powder and some gelatin in a pot you can use any flavor jello powder that you like I use raspberry but again it is totally up to you then you want to add some water and let it sit for five minutes for the gelatin to develop then you want to set the pot to medium low heat and stir it until the gelatin is fully melted and it's just like at night and melt to a liquid in your pot then place that go your mold on a flat tray or a baking sheet and for the mixture into the mold and I carefully transfer this to the fridge do you want to chill it overnight orange soda can we make sure it has please set and it does set quite firmly so you want the luggage cream clean whatever but you want to set it until it basically has an ogive to it when you push down on it ends up feeling pretty firm when it then does I'm hopefully better onto your work surface and you can eat it like that or actually the kid I bought comes with these cute little bags so if you want really cute like placeholder for parties or like a little loot bag or something this is so cool in the little twist type I just like so yeah I hope you like this video on down below if you'd like me to show you how to make a sour version because I think that's how we're building bears are so good it'd be really to twist on this recipe I'm just watching it tie me up please hit that subscribe button to bring that notification belt so you're notified when I upload my next video because I have what five is a week and if you guys end up making watch it gummy bears vodka jump out gummy bears coming in a little look I'm Stefan from logos so much and I will see you tomorrow origami video", "eAnRuqGXSsY": "okay okay what oh gee the dummy burrs not do gummy bears today let being covered chocolate I have these they never complain too much far enough back or another spacing good no no well it looks like the more vertical ones don't get stuck but they're all I mean if there's long as you keep them like straight forward yeah yeah I like that I like that one wow this is gonna be exciting video can max get it before they get eaten up Robert [Music] okay you could just someone's daily bread clusters right worst-case scenario down here on your dad toss you know he was like at the end of the bag or something and he just threw a hook and pull out of it to the chain like instead of line in my views they're like yeah we'll see what happens don't work you know if you want gummy bread clusters on the right yeah I guess listen see what what Craig's doing is more important than what you're doing so you know takes right yeah you know let me just Sunday to know we got a streaker so how come I haven't seen the blower on top in a while yeah do you guys not needing like in the beginning I remember yeah we we use it on Oreos like but most of the stuff does need the extra you know the extra push to get more drop it off yeah yeah and I'm sure the people at home but hey I don't care if I can't see the details I just want more chocolate yeah I was just gonna say I don't think anybody that's coming here is gonna complain yeah [Music] you reason against the clock - let me give you the lay down on their backs yeah this is flat on the back that makes sense how many times have you guys done this unmanned Rover before a couple time maybe turtle this is at least a second is it slightly less tedious doing it this way plus tedious we've been doing it by hand oh well it's a lot faster I'll tell ya yeah this board I mean still not really that fast is it just cuz there's so many yeah they're so like it'll still take you forever to do a whole bag yeah is that all one bag over there yeah that's okay awesome yeah they yeah it looks like line them up on the back is the way to go my dad you can do it it's suffereth we're getting there there I got to hurry up dummies thunk OH holy gummy well the gummies Batman so I haven't had gummy bears in many many many years so do each color have different flavors or they all taste the same yeah beacons can't eat bears yeah I think they're actually I think they have like gelatin in them or something oh yeah yeah I don't know jenos Swedish Fish well they're all red so it's probably won't taste red taste right yeah the red tastes a threat to me but the Scandinavian swimmers from Trader Joe's all the different tastes when Max get to it before it plops on the rug taste that was a close driveling drunkies very strong places like chocolate factories yeah that's how the old saying goes anyway yep can he do it has it ever actually fallen off yet yeah that's how I know how much time I have left yeah trial and error I just haven't been down here error and error yeah well how long has it been since it fell down it's been months okay so just in the beginning yeah it's good need adjusting the temperature dad [Music] [Music] to second they dumped abomination neck's is too thick I'm trying to lose weight right oh I was talking about like thick-headed I'll talk about thick-headed you know you could be like ethan klein thick all right so this is gonna be kelly's second bag ohh dummy bears yes yeah yeah you have any tips and tricks for people doing this Ellen well I don't really think many people are doing this at home hello are you I'm good you need any help let me know yeah because I don't think everybody would have proper equipment yeah we don't have the bags at home which I understand because I'm the new girl hmm so I understand that the orange scale is pretty famous I came over from the old country yeah so it's and it's it's very reliable so we like the orange ghetto and I can't imagine there's a lot of people who have machines to cover gummy bears but if they did if they did yeah then sure they should they could totally do this at home so you just pick them up to put them in the bag and blame on the scale all right pick them up and I put them in the bag and then I weigh them on this case in that order yeah yeah unless I'm really close because if you have all right let's let's add a few more do it okay so and you know I think that dark chocolate is lighter than milk chocolate hmm I think I've noticed that like one pound a one pound of dark chocolate is lighter than 1 pound of milk chef it no but if you're covering stuff I think it weighs different that make sense this is all in my head but that's ok ok so when it see then you got to be like oh we need one more it has to be accurate because nobody wants to get gypped on the chocolate mm-hmm that's not fun No so yeah I I got the dark chocolate ones and I have never tried chocolate-covered joiners gummy bears yeah I had before they weren't my favorite but some people are crazy about them right so what do you do what do you do after have you put them in the bags well after I get them wait because I'm really organized so I am like a system mm-hmm so what I do is I'll get a whole bunch together and then after that is I'm gonna weigh them when they're always on a label so should I come back when they're all waiting yeah and then we can like label them and state bloom and then barcode them and then we can get him on the Shelf that's totally fine sounds like fun what is this part 2 and part 3 part 3 we already know so this is part 3 and so what we do is we take the bag are you gonna get all the air out cuz nobody likes stale candy mm-hmm so get all the air out I'm gonna burping oh we burped the bag burps to being everybody and then we fold it nice and snug and then we have to put a label on mm-hmm see cuz presentation is everything how you determine which bag or which color goes on with bag well decision getting necessarily for color but you want a variety cuz nobody likes boring either yes we need a variety of colors and then we need to make sure that we have the right weight on it because if I put this out and I have the 4 ounce label then that's wrong we don't want to do that because you know it's the whole thing not corpse breathing down your neck that's right I mean like because then I'll get fired and I like just started here so I kind of wanna keep my job labeling is everything yeah you gotta have great label with the right weight and you gotta have it pretty and nice and snug because nobody likes that's a lot of things you're under all ones yeah needless to say I had no idea how much detail goes into being a candy wrapper yeah it's it's a little crazy and I also am just scratching the surface to what I'm going to learn yeah so Karen's teaching you the ways Karen is teaching me and your mom is teaching me so I am learning from the experts gotta get I've got to get it right because you know people are used to consistency too when you change something you don't you don't want them to be like aw I can tell Kelly wrap this in yeah and that would be my luck somebody wrap this wrong it doesn't look right I'll take Karen's handiwork we need to we need to repackage the whole thing alright so I know you're gonna keep doing that but can we show the people what you do next after that well then I got a barcode it okay so and oh yeah I have it right here oh boy so we have the dark chocolate gummy bears and half pound because we're doing a half pound and hey careful where you point that gun this yeah sorry all right where's Bowl see I hey that thing's loaded I haven't done anything today so I'm a pointer sorry no he's also had your thumb up - oh did look kind of like a guy yeah I'm not violent I promise I'm a non-violent individual I'm family candymaker that's right you know cuz candy makes people happy so why would you want to be violent mm-hmm so we're gonna paste I was wrong got a piece the barcode in there and do did you do gotta pick the right label and I gotta count how many bags because we don't want to waste labels or barcodes so I've got four five six seven 12 13 14 yup 14 bags those and we're gonna print out the labels so after all of these get packaged up all nice and pretty where you get the barcode on them and then we're gonna get best by dates that's my date yes it's not like the store see that's why I wasn't sure it is a sticker so we know that when you buy the candy it's fresh cuz you're gonna have fresh candy too so I'm gonna pull all of these I'm one have one perp cuz if I did that see any labels there are there would be no room by you might have Best Buy later so one of these I'll give you an example yeah what can you do that again case I missed it slow motion Wow I think people really got that in there and then we need Best Buy sticker but I don't know how long these last so I look that up too because everything that we have is different depending on what the product is dairy okay this is the only gun we use around here man all right so is that the last thing you do other than put it out there well no then I gotta write it on the handy-dandy clipboard so we know how many we have because then when we have the stuff we can put it online for the people mm-hmm and put on the shelf for the people so the people can come to all of the people and buy the candy and the chocolate-covered gummy bears which are ready yeah oh we're so where'd we put it out on the floor and they all have their little spots Olivia's gonna go here we've got our dark chocolate gummy bears and soon we'll have the four ounce and I think later I might be doing some of the milk chocolate gummy bears so that way we'll have these all back to replenish our stock from Christmas because everybody just loves us and just keeps buying it so yeah you know gotta get it out there for the people so it come to a very unfortunate decision this is gonna be our last shoutout video because there's so many shoutouts that people are requesting and we can't get to all of them so we feel really bad for the people who who asked and then never get it and they might be asking like 10 times but if we never see it we can't you know we can't do that shoutout because I used to answer every single comment and you see every single thing on every social media and then we got way too big I was a good thing I'm glad we're getting somebody comment so they can't get y'all I'm glad I'm glad we have so many people asked for shadows and we can't get to a mile but it's unfortunate for the people who are asking all the time so we're instead of leaving a couple people out or a lot of people out in the cold we're gonna leave everybody out in the cold warmer clime yeah so that's that's our solution to that problem it's gonna make the same thing for live streams just because when we do live streams everybody like almost everything will come and just ask them for a shoutout so if we were to do a live stream it would just basically just be us standing here just giving shoutouts and I think people want to see us making candy so if you do want to shout out if you do a super chat then we give you a shout out but other than that we'll we will just be answering questions and stuff for free so anyway to shout outs I have four four I have three ish okay is the an Alexander from Elizabeth New Jersey mm-hmm Keegan Graham from Lowell Massachusetts Carol and Leonard from Calgary Alberta Canada and Jennifer sinkovitz she didn't actually ask me for a shot up but she sent a note a thank-you note saying thanks for your YouTube channel I'm gonna subscriber I like it so there you go Jennifer and I'm not unasked-for shout out the way I'm ending this thing and I have a couple I have to take off my gloves so it's sanitary yeah I can't be touching ears I mean you can't take them off after using the camera to what you want clean candy-making okay it's just that hammer doesn't care about my camera they just care about the candy okay so Jules almond I think on how you say her name happy birthday to Kailyn Brown whose birthday was on December 5th yeah so we're telling you we're a little behind Angeline merger see from South Africa living in China and so she want me to say so that is all the the shoutouts for Hercules candy hope you enjoyed him yeah cuz it was good while it lasted this is the end my only friend hmm this is the end was that from a song I think the doors song probably yeah I'm sure our people will tell us probably [Music]", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to rage shadow legends of the massive multiplayer online realtime strategy game that will take you

you we're not going for a glowing red that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "lAguCOu_Nmk": "hey everyone its Laura from our oily house calm and today I'm gonna show you how to make immune-boosting gummy bears [Music] as we go into the cooler months we are doing everything we can to keep those immune systems high and just last week I showed you guys some of my favorite tips on boosting the immune system and I shared my elderberry syrup recipe and today I want to share with you how you can make elderberry syrup gummy bears so to do this recipe you're going to need some elderberry syrup so if you miss that post where I shared my recipe I will link that up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out for this recipe you're gonna need a cup of your elderberry syrup so I'm just gonna pour it in here and then I'm just gonna put half of a cup into my glass bowl for right now and then we're going to add in some gelatin and this is some unflavored gelatin from grass-fed cows and this is really adds a lot of protein and has tons of help in if it's for you and this is what I'm going to use to make your gummi bears set up do you need 1/4 of a cup of this gelatin and I like the kind I use in the description below and we are going to whisk this together pretty quickly gelatin doesn't harden going to whisk this together until it is completely mixed into your elderberry syrup then you're going to add in 1/2 a cup of hot water you don't want this water to be boiling but you want it to be hot to kind of help dissolve the gelatin into the mixture then you're just going to continue to whisk this together you're gonna smell it kind of has that jello smell because of the gelatin and then after it's you know well mixed you're just gonna add in your other half a cup of elderberry syrup just keep whisking it together so it's well incorporated once it's all whisked together we are going to put it into our mold and I have these cute little gummy bear molds that I found on Amazon that I just love and I'll link them in the description below if you don't have gelatin molds you can make these just with a 9 by 13 pan and you can just pour it in there then just cut it into little squares that's totally fine too but my kids think these are really fun and then before we pour our mixture in there I'm going to grease them with just a little bit of coconut oil just to prevent them from sticking so I just grabbed some coconut oil just kind of rub it into my bears a little bit here I'm gonna use a dropper to drop them in and this came with my molds if you don't have one of these you can use like an old medicine drop or anything just kind of makes it easier to put into your mold so I'm just gonna fill up all of my gummy bears after you have your molds completely full we're just gonna pop these into the refrigerator and because my molds are so small these will be hardened in about 20 minutes but if you're using a 9 by 13 pan you might have to leave it in there for about four to eight hours once it's all set up you can just pop your gummy bears right out of your mold you can take these daily to help boost the immune system I like to give these to my kids five days on two days off just so we don't get any type of immunity to them they really just help to boost the immune system they are loaded with vitamins A B and C they're completely healthy and the kids really love them and you guys can use this same recipe to make all different types of gummy bears so I have tried this instead of the Alpha berry syrup I'll use an orange juice I've used grape juice we've used strawberry juice these are super fun my kids love them we can make all different flavors in colors I shared some of my kids favorite recipes for gummy bears in the description below and also over on the blog I have some free printable recipe cards if you are looking for more education for essential oils grab my free online class in the

I'm home cook hot mess mark Fischetti and I'm Scott Guerin the research and development chef here at modernist pantry and today we're talking about one of my favorite I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie my favorite ingredient in the in the modernist pantry catalog the druids grove vegan gelatin this is actually this was my introduction to the to the company and and to your cooking skills so this WTF is a particularly special one thank you for being here for it so here's what's really cool about this this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so modernist pantry com just search V ghen gelatin in the search bar at modernist

"UZUy5uWSpSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then love craft country", "AgJ_1UQlC3U": "[Music] my name is Liz this is the first time you're joining if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I hope you enjoyed it if this is the first time you're

you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug

so cuties today we're gonna draw a gummy bear so let's get started to draw this gummy bear working the first time I drawing the nose and mouth area so I'm just gonna come right here and draw a curve so this is gonna be a center of the bear so it's just a nice little curve and we're gonna round it off on both sides it's nice and even and we're just gonna draw a little curve that comes in to the center and back so it's kind of like a jelly bean so towards the center and come back down and then at the bottom we're gonna add a curve so they're just going to do the mouth area okay and then right here in the center we're gonna draw a little oval for his nose there okay so then we're gonna come to this side right here and give it a draw circle for the eyes it's around the top right on this corner let's sit here about right here I'm gonna start a hand same thing on this size about right here just try to point across [Music] [Music] there now let's make them draw sec UI someone come in here with two small circles for highlights and the curve line at the bottom then shade in the top [Music] and the lines at the bottom so same thing on this side [Music] okay so we have the nose and the eyes in let's come over to the side right where the eye is we're just going to give it a little bit space and we're just gonna draw a curve right here so but right here I'm just gonna draw a slight curve just going to right drag this point right across that bub right here so same thing and then from there we're gonna come up here you can draw the ear so from right here come in a little bit or you can start right here just imagine this line going through so whichever way is easier for you I'm just gonna imagine that going through and about right here I'm just gonna give myself a little gap and I'm gonna draw a curve all the way over so if you're using a pencil you can just go all the way across and then you race that part later that's easier so we're just going to draw a curve right across so now we have a space for the ears and it's down a little bit more so in here we're just gonna draw a curve for the ears and same thing on this side all right there make sure about the same level and we got a little ears in now we're gonna come over here and tuck this curve in a tiny bit just to define the head area in the neck where it starts ok so then now we can come down a little bit more so we're gonna start to draw the arms so just pop it out a little bit more not too much because gummy bears are pretty compact so from there now we can come and straw the hands so I'll just do this side first so then we can now draw the other side a little bit later so I'm just going to bring this in and curve and come in so let's just same thing on this side so let's see here come down so let's give ourselves appointment drag this right across and above right here in the center area so I'm gonna aim for that point and then once again round it off man I'm going to end at this point about right here then connect okay so now for the body area right here we're gonna come in a little bit just trust slight curve on both sides so we're still keeping it pretty compact and then from there now we can draw the feet so come out a little bit and right here we're just gonna ground it off all right there start to bring it in and go all the way around oops okay and then same thing on this side there's just some days my hands don't work everything goes wrong so high right here okay and then I'm gonna bring this up just like the other side [Music] they're now in the center right here we're just going to add a little curve all the way across and then because this is my Dras acute gummy bear and we're going to come right here and add a little heart and that is pretty much it for this cute little gummy bear hope it inspires you to give it a try and thanks so much for watching if you loved it please give me a thumbs up and share it and remember to subscribe so you won't

style recipes and today I've got a treat for you we'll be making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app

gameplay from the past ball this one this first game is from today the other game also we have gummy bears just so the first game is i gave my plate today on the 20th of september and the other game was um um it was actually in the youtube membership video so if you guys saw that it was the background gameplay for that but i did want to include it in this video just because i really wanted to make a siege video tonight with these gummy bears and i didn't really have any other siege gameplay that i like really wanted to share with you guys so i have recently started to play ash more and actually really really enjoy playing at i'm trying to learn some of the different operators that i can use so if you guys have any suggestions for good operators for beginners i'm pretty sure i already got it kind of figured out but if there's an operator that you see me not using that you think i you know could be good at then feel free to let me know also you guys all noticed that i increased increased fov to 90 and also i didn't realize that the game settings wouldn't automatically update when i got my 144 arts monitor so i also updated that in the graphical settings and it is beautiful beautiful i love 90 fov thank you guys so much for the tips and also the 144 hertz refresh rate and this game is really really awesome so hopefully you guys are all doing well i really am

excuse me if you have any tips for me i would appreciate if you guys share them with me down in the comments nicely of course but i am trying to get better at siege and i'm getting better slowly but surely but i would like to um really increase my skills at this game i'm slowly learning the maps and the layouts and everything but um any other tips would be great i do need to um go into these maps and like look at like camera placements and where the the walls and the rooms are and stuff so i'm trying to get better at um rotating more and trying to switch up my positions just so i don't um you know sit still all game and get caught off guard i was playing a lot of doc and ash today i just kind of realized that instead of a sledge or thatcher and capkin because those are the operators i normally play although i did play talk in the last video i think because he was like the cover the last two of us is actually me and one of our moderators here on the channel until we clutch up this 2e3 to get our team the flawless actually clutch it up with the uh the cap can trip but still nailed it we got uh we did not get mvp this game however we did go five and zero which is pretty nice i'll take it so here is the second game this is an ongoing match and we came in and we were down to zero so um i kind of expected to just lose either we would lose the third round or we would like come back a couple of rounds um but you'll see how the gameplay pans out i thought it was a pretty cool gameplay so so so so um i just want to drop a shameless plug for the channel memberships here have you made it this far i really appreciate you watching we also have channel memberships available on the channel and a few people have already signed up for the gold deer which includes the benefit of being able to play games um with me and i will you know record and maybe we can get some cool gameplay for the channel um so if you guys are enjoying the content and you'd like to see or see extra

let me know what you guys think of the like hand sounds and the cupping like the the whispers with like the cupped hands like this let me know what you guys think of it i've just kind of been including it in the videos recently and i feel like it would sound good but i'm not entirely sure i've made some videos with the um the candy box and you guys seem to really like that i don't have a candy box tower just have the um the pouch with the gummy bears in it but maybe that's enjoyable who knows so so so i need to get some more gummy bears out excuse the sounds unless they're enjoyable then you're welcome i guess these gummy bears are very very good you can't go wrong with some gummy bears let me know what you guys think of the new siege operator i almost have 25 000 renown and i kind of want to know like if he's worth getting and like showcasing he seems pretty cool um just i don't know if it would be worth it for you know because i still have let's dive enough i could probably get two you know like 10 000 renown operators or like a 10 000 renown and a 15 000 renown um instead of getting him but if he's truly that good you know then maybe i'll uh i'll jump on the hype train and make a video for you guys so so all right everybody there it is that is the end of the gameplay i appreciate you guys watching this video i hope you enjoyed it and i hope you sleep very very very well good night", "UEt7Gc6nZ-8": "well bloomberg put up an article saying you know uh barcelona leader like says he has grown a virus and the stock dipped three percent instantly and that's

they pulled up next to me and said roll your window down roll your window down and they were having an argument and they pointed the billboard and said do you say that gyro or hero and i said i say hero and the the wife was like see i told you and then they drove off and he was probably pissed off that [ __ ] white dude he [ __ ] me over my name is brandon walker and i am the host of pick central um the gambling show every day on sirius 85 bar stools series radio station that was appointed to that position by dave portnoy who came up with the show and decided i was the one who should host the gambling show on barstool power 85 serious it was his choice could have chose anybody but he didn't chose me yes brain did you see uh a blog that just drops i think a lot of blocks are up on the site it was uh it sounded like it was kind of calling out another gambling show yeah yeah uh so apparently blackjack and laduca have launched hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during

normally don't get to see because they live in the middle of the country and hopefully i'll get some content out of it too i have no idea what to expect i've heard that the chicago office is is very humble compared to what we have in new york uh they're kind of a bare bones operation salt of the earth and i'm a salt of the earth guy so i feel like i should mesh pretty well farmer's insurance

a pop i was like yeah we can't expense that ah it's not really worth it i'm not even a cubs fan but then he was like you know what i think i know a guy let me try to pull some strings and voila all you can drink all you can eat and a beautiful view of a baseball game not gonna lie i feel pretty special because like no one else in the entire us is watching baseball live these days maybe live on tv but not at the stadium this is nice look at this guys guys we are on the verge this is like a cup worm this is like a cup worm we throw in three more cups that's an official cup snacks look how

app marvel racing you know people always talk about it they always you know tweet us like do marble racing do marble racing uh so we decided to try it obviously you just have to build it yourself so and the interns around here do nothing except for sit in the gaming cave all day and talk [ __ ] so i was like billy i i was like billy you and the interns i didn't say you're going to be in charge of the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like reacting like there's a live broadcast and then i don't know her name what's her name dev dev was like oh my god i'm so sorry like i i didn't mean to do i was like i don't know what you're talking about she's like you've been have you been talking to me in the controlling for the last half an hour i was like i literally just walked in the door and then billy had like his little smirk on his face like yeah we've kind of been telling them just like that you were in the in the control room the whole time billy's a menace he's an absolute menace uh he has no supervision he's just gonna who knows what's gonna happen with that kid i'm side to side i'm just terrible and this will be the start and then we'll connect two towers from here and you can incorporate and why don't we get something so it all connects back here you need to connect these to this right um this is so high let's just assemble one this is gonna take way longer let's just assemble something solid and then from there we can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles you know so you're actually serious you guys are standing like like we're not gonna do the real one jake we also wanted to test the integrity of this and also the camera like where's ashton kutcher like i feel like actually it's gonna come out yeah i'm so sorry we thought that was fake what do you mean when we kept laughing like you were saying that i was being [ __ ] annoying you", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you guys hope you have a wonderful day bye", "4m3HIZtrzWs": "[music playing]", "n3_dV-e4d9c": "For this video, I\u2019m going to show you how\nto take a few simple ingredients, and make mountains and mountains of your own custom\ngummy candies, at home. Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,\nand a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,\nand for this recipe, you\u2019ll actually only need 2 of them. Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very\ncold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate\nproperly, and the corn syrup is going to give our gummies a nice smooth texture. Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,\nso give it a good stirring until the water turns completely clear. Then go ahead and\npour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don\u2019t turn on the stove just yet. I\u2019ll show you\nwhat happens if you do in just a minute. Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored\ngelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire packet of Jell-O.  Now it\u2019s going to take a minute or two for\nthe gelatin to absorb into the water, but take your time and be patient so you don\u2019t\nmake a mess. And keep stirring it slowly, until you can see all the gelatin is mixed\nin. Alright, it\u2019s time to heat things up, and\nturn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup. Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around\n5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning. While that\u2019s warming, it\u2019s a good idea\nto find something you can use as a candy mold, like these ice cube trays, I found at the\nLEGO store. When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,\nthe syrup is ready for pouring. And you should be able to pour it straight into the molds.\nBut be careful not to spill, because the syrup\u2019s extremely hot, and will burn you. Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles\nfloating to the top, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t start with cold water, or you\nheated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate. But don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a really easy\nway to fix it. Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,\nheat-resistant container, like a large drinking glass. As you do, you\u2019ll immediately notice\nall the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes\nto give it all a good chance to settle and cool a bit, and you\u2019ll soon see all the\nimpurities collect together at the top, and separate into a layer of gummy foam. Now check this out. All you have to do is\nreach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape this newly formed skin away. Just like that,\nyou\u2019ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And\nto make the next steps as easy as possible, I\u2019m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment\ncontainer. These kinds of containers are perfect for\nfilling up your molds. They\u2019re super easy to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly\nwhere you need it, which helps avoid spilling, or overflowing the molds with too much gummy. I gave these candies a few hours to cool,\nso you can see just how much of a difference it makes, to take the extra step and skim\nthe bubbles off the top, before making your candies. Alright, let\u2019s see how our gummy mix does\nwith a much more intricate, and detailed ice cube mold, like this one. And you might have\nnoticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear. 5 hours later, we\u2019ve got ourselves a batch\nof really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently, are balanced enough, that they can stand up\non their own. That\u2019s kind of cool. Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from\nactual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone mix from a special effects supply store.. Now you should know that when the syrup cools\ndown, it\u2019s going to shrink a little. So to compensate for that, try filling the molds\njust a tiny bit higher than the top. For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO\nbaseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable oil, then carefully placed it down on top\nof the mold. You can see the edges have little dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly\naligned. So all it needs now is something like a heavy book to give it some weight,\nand hold it in place. I let these ones cool on the counter for around\n6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO\ngummies, have small divots on the bottom, which means they\u2019re connectable. Let\u2019s take one of the bricks out out of\nthe mold, and take a good look up close. You can see there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail\ncaptured in the gummy snack, and they\u2019re not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,\nand they smell delicious. You probably also noticed they\u2019re completely\ntransparent, which puts their level of awesomeness on a completely different scale. Alright let\u2019s take this idea to the next\nlevel with different colors and different flavors. I tripled the recipes and made 7 different\nbatches. Then let them cool overnight so they\u2019d all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing\nthis yourself, you might find that getting them out of the cups is pretty tricky. When you do get them out though, you\u2019ll\nhave a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat on it\u2019s own. But that\u2019s ok because what\nwe\u2019re really after here is the white layer of gummy foam at the top. Now if you\u2019re really careful, you can use\nsomething like a kitchen knife to slowly trim the top layer off, which will leave you with\na huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted\non medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want. I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,\nin all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes. And if you look closely, you can even see\nsome little gummy guys in there as well. In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back\nto the store and picked up a bunch of containers, just so I could have a unique place, to store\nmy custom candies. Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,\nbut I ended up mixing all mine together and filling the containers with all kinds of random\npieces. How awesome is that? The best part is, if you snap on the lid and\nkeep them in the fridge, they can stay good for up to a month. Now since the gummies are interlocking, you\nmight be wondering if you can build things with them as well. The answer is yes, as long\nas you can resist the temptation to snack on them first. For one last experiment, try finding a handful\nof chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I\nused 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch, and when you mix the powder into the gummy\nsyrup, you\u2019ve just made your candies, vitamin C enriched. Of course these are a slightly\nhealthier version, but more importantly, it gives them a slightly sour taste, making them\neven more delicious, and extremely addictive. Well now you know how to use a few simple\ningredients to make a bucketful, of colorful LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,\nand fun to share. By the way, you don\u2019t have to make your\ngummies into LEGOs. You can actually make any thing you can think of. I converted some\nof my left over syrup, into an assortment of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject, perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others.

have this juicy flavor to it our rowing push my band I'm like doing count wheels and back flips and stop then and going to fly [Music]", "-wjpkHnN7KU": "let me tell you about the day I lost control of my life and made 12 different flavors of homemade gummi bears [Music] is making your own gummy bears from scratch kind of fun sure yeah but if you do decide to make homemade gummy bears whole wheat will lose you should be prepared to confront a darkness that lies deep inside you that you never knew was there it all started when I learned you can buy gummy bear molds from the internet I had the Epiphany that you can make a gummy bear that tastes like anything you want you just add gelatin literally anything can be a gummy bear any drink can be a gummy bear any cocktail can be a gummy bear anything you can blend and a blender can be a gummy bear and once you realize that the world of gummy bears is basically limitless you'll never be the same again the main ingredient and homemade gummy bears is gelatin gelatin is like having a superpower you can use it for good and evil with gelatin you can basically solidify anything you want but it's dangerous because while you can jellify pretty much any food the question is should you so when it comes to gummy bear flavors I thought I would start out with some of your classic fruit flavors like blueberry strawberry but I realized I could do something like tomato juice or a Bloody Mary gummy bear or even a bone broth gummy bear or clam juice even why not like if you really wanted to you could make savory gummy bears I don't know why you would but you could the first thing I did was I went to the grocery store and I bought all the gelatin they had that's not an exaggeration I literally cleaned them out and I would eventually use it all the process for making homemade gummy bears is pretty simple you mix up your liquid and your gelatin you put it into the molds using a little dropper then you just put it in the fridge for a few hours and let it set but it can go wrong my first batch of gummy bears which was strawberry was a huge batch of gummy failure on my first batch I only used a little bit of gelatin and it made the Bears weak and soft and kind of slimy and no one's ever said oh I love gummy bears but I wish they were wetter so I needed to crank the gelatin way up so once I finally got over my fear of gelatin and used a bunch of it they actually started to look like gummy bears and my first batch of successful bears that actually looked like real gummy bears was a Manhattan cocktail flavor they had whiskey and maraschino cherry syrup I wanted them to taste like an episode of Mad Men and I feel like if Don Draper tried these he would spit them into the trash you asked me if I liked it but I thought they tasted good and he actually looks like real gummy bears the most difficult part of the process is actually taking the Bears out of the mold you have to take each tiny bear out individually and it takes forever once I nailed the formula I just kept making more bears in new and more exotic flavors and I couldn't stop there was creamsicle there was matcha there was coffee there was apple cider for fall there was rose a there was even a margarita there with tequila lime and salt so a tiny voice in my head kept saying maybe you should stop making gummy bears now but I couldn't stop I just kept thinking of new flavors I wanted to try and I spent hours taking little bears out of mold making gummy bears I just I could not stop so I'm almost too embarrassed to say how many gummy bears I made I don't really want people to know that this is how I spent my time but I made a thousand gummy bears that's too many gummy bears I would recommend homemade gummy bears probably to no one but if you have a really interesting flavor you want to try or if you want to make a very slightly healthier alternative to candy it's a good thing to try but mostly you should make homemade gummy bears if you want to feel Howard like the rules of tandy don't apply to you and you want to make hundreds of tiny edible bear friends do I think that making homemade gummy bears was a good use of my time no but am I glad I did it sure why not [Music] [Music] [Music]", "7E4h_jZAoII": "we love gummy bears and this time we're freezing them in Sona popsicles of course when thinking of sweet treats I knew I

know what I do I want it hopefully learn today after strawberry teaches me shy married oh there you are hi there so why are you sorry what are you going to do today well I'm going to teach you what's potations you don't know how Thank You strawberry that's nice of you so just to teach you multiplication starts every four times Inc with the X it always starts every time you have two times it sorry that that would not the best description but what I mean is every time you multiply you have to count that number that much time so say example one times one one account one one time what do I get one good job blueberry you know something okay and I hardly wants five times five count five five times how much time do you get 5 10 15 20 25 the age of 25 Oh multiplication said simpler than I thought how else do I do it well since I don't have paper there's a harder way but it goes by faster say I have a problem called with double juice called 12 times 5 wow that's a big number I don't know what to do so say you had paper write down 12 on the paper times 5 you count what's 5 times 2 you can't to 5 times 2 4 6 8 10 there we go 10 so we wear a zebra on the paper and add the 1 so then 5 times 1 is 5 put her to F extra 5 which will make that six so what is that 6 Steve I was just excited 60s the answer yep that's correct and multiplications simpler than you think just you really have to think through it yes Natsuki so much easy now Thank You strawberry you're welcome and that's gonna do it for today's video if you guys did enjoy this will learning gummy bear video make sure to leave a like

one of grant's most popular projects making gummy legos [Music] hey guys today we're here with the whole king of random family hey we're here because we wanted to make one of grant's most popular projects lego gummies so we thought it fitting to include all the kids and we wanted to make an appearance and say hi it's been a year and we wanted to enjoy one of grant's projects and commemorate this time that you guys have spent with us and give you a little insight into where we're at and have a little fun on camera here's the basic idea we're here with the king of random family to make some gummy legos that you can eat and build with okay so should we get pour in some legos guys yeah all right all right so we're gonna be following the recipe grant laid out previously which is made of jello some extra gelatin powder a little bit of water and then you can tinker with the colors with some food coloring if you like but for the most part jello of course has colors uh and one little twist we are gonna try is we're going to see if we can use some tonic water and maybe some b2 vitamin powder to see if we can get gummies that glow in a black light what do you guys think of glowing lego gummy should we try it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] so each batch like i said doesn't have very many ingredients we have half a cup of water we'll do one quarter cup of corn syrup a small box of jello it comes in multiple sizes we're going for the three ounce boxes of jello and two packets of the unflavored gelatin one thing that i have learned in making this is that it's actually easier by a long shot to mix the gelatin in if you do it before the corn syrup so instead of watering corn syrup together and then adding the jello and stuff i'm just doing the water then i'll have the two packets of gelatin and the entire box of jello and then we're gonna add our quarter cup of corn syrup into it otherwise you get clumps and lumps and takes a long time to dissolve in just trying to make sure there's no big clumps or even little clumps of the gelatin left it's not going to well if we have clumps in it now then it's not going to evenly dissolve into the water and then we won't have enough gelatin and our jello gummy lego bricks will be like too weak they won't be strong enough to come out of the mold so we want the liquid to be nice and smooth and we want the clumps to dissolve evenly so we get a nice thick jello now when grant was testing this recipe we probably made it five to ten times before we got the perfect recipe so we'd open the gelatin he tried an extra teaspoon of gelatin didn't work then he tried two extra teaspoons of gelatin we got to the point where we found out these packets are perfectly proportionate that two packets was the ideal amount but then he tried three packets to see if that would work those were really gross lego gummies because you could barely not they were like really really like a gummy bear but worse yeah they were really like tough but gummy so they were gross because they were almost hard but they were still gummy so we had a good laugh about that so now we're just mixing in the corn syrup one quarter cup of corn syrup mixed into it so the corn syrup also allows the extra gelatin to make the texture of the gummy more smooth so that was another thing we had to learn because we tried just putting the extra gelatin in and like i said it was really like hard even though it was gummy but the corn syrup gives it that nice smooth texture and extra sugar yeah it's gonna smell let's see what flavor is this we're doing apricot we've got some apricot jello that's pretty well mixed in so now we're gonna throw this on the stove at medium low heat and just let it heat up until it gets clear everything gets perfectly well dissolved and melted into it and then we'll let it cool down a bit and pour it into our mold although if we have too much bubbles or foam we've got something we can do to get rid of some of that as well we have this tonic water and the tonic water in the black light actually glows kind of blue so i think this would be a good one to try mixing with the blue powder and see if it'll uh all right let's see so instead of just plain water we're going to be using the tonic water all right so you actually don't want quite all of it because this is a different brand and each packet is 3.94 so we want about three quarters of it so don't put all of it in [Music] there's no more in there perfect good job it's pretty loud it is all right all of it all of it okay you get on here and we'll make your red jello next okay all right i'm gonna open it okay perfect wow it's going to pour it right there just pour it all into the jar [Music] good man oh wow look that made some bubbles do we like bubbles in our lego gummies no no how are we gonna get rid of those bubbles does anybody know okay we've got our our apricot is about ready and you can see that there are some bubbles on the surface of it we're just gonna see if we can take all that off if it's not coming off super easily something you can definitely do as grant showed in the original is you can just pour everything into a tall cup and as it cools down this foam and gunk stuff is going to cool off and just be really easy to remove i want to feel it oh it's hot it's hot it's hot as you can see in the mold this is lego bricks sort of upside down and we want there to be interlocking bump shapes on the underside of the legos so that they can fit together so to do that we're going to use this base plate and we're going to sort of smoosh it down onto the mold after we've got all the stuff in there but we don't want it to stick too much it doesn't stick too much to silicone sticks a little bit but not excessively but to make sure it doesn't stick too much to our plate we're going to just add some oil and i'm just going to use some paper towel and sort of smear it around on there until it's got a good coating in the original lego gummies the first pours we did we just poured the lego gummies and brought them out so they had a flat bottom so they were not stackable and we were sitting there eating them and they were really good and grant was like hey wouldn't it be fun if we could stack these i was like yeah that'd be really cool how could we do that and we would like kind of it seems really obvious but at the time we hadn't come up with the idea of using this to put on there so the next mold we did we took the silicone and we were like how could we make bumps on the underside right so we're like could we get legos and put them on there and then we're like maybe we could get flat legos and put them on top and then we saw these bases and grant was like oh genius what if we took the base and put it on like that to make bottoms for the lego so that they would have those imprints coming up so then they became stackable after that so fun little story all right we've got our apricot mix about ready so i'm just gonna pour it off into a squeeze bottle here to try and get some of those bubbles out though i just have the lid on and i'm just going to spin it around and the centripetal force will get some of those bubbles out whoa well that's aggressive it is but it brings some of the bubbles up to the top so there's just a little bit less go ahead and pour it right in i want to do it good job jamie i wouldn't do it you'll get a chance too can i do it yeah you're going to get it turned up that one's perfect too do good pours i'm just going to help you squeeze that in maybe we'll okay and then on to the next one so at this point i'm going to put our base plate over the lego mold here to try and get the interior bumps all of these would be ready yep here we are we're back what's ready for us guys hey is that one of the ones that the two colors that was a two color i think you got a drip of the apricot so you might even be a three color technically this one i think it was red first and then blue that turned out really well i like it that's awesome you already would mix but it looks like it didn't yeah this one i think was the one that was too liquefied to have any separation so that one didn't this is totally but actually you can see the blue on the bottom but it's pretty mixed so just a couple of tips for anyone who's trying this out based on my experiences so i think i already talked about how i really recommend you add the gelatin before the corn syrup i would also recommend being sure to wash your mold with soap and water and rinse it well in between each batch i did a couple of badges off screen and the second batch i had a really hard time getting out of the mold i also think it's helping quite a bit that these are cold the second batch i did i just let cool sitting outside on the counter it wasn't in the fridge i think refrigerating it to cool it down and pulling it out while they're cold makes it a lot easier that and like i said i washed the mold i think all of those things helped because these you can see i'm just they just come out really nice and easily for the most part and my first batch came out easily my second batch was a little bit of a struggle this is a short layer of orange and blue and then riley's idea was to put them together and make them layered like this so now it almost looks like a fine delicacy you could find on a cruise ship a sam's definitely done or the world's weirdest sushi if you want to stack them and build with them they should work for that too okay let's see what you guys can stack and build everybody grab five these ones these ones will stack together these ones won't these ones could be the base though so if you're careful you can actually get the bricks to interlock what did you do is it sticking on your face the blue ones were made with tonic water and the yellow and green ones were made with a little bit of b2 vitamins so let's see how much glowing we got out of them under a [Music] the yellow ones glow quite a bit under a black light that's pretty intense and i think it's interesting so the orange ones we didn't add any powder to them but there was a fluorescent food coloring that i added that apparently glows just a little bit as well some of it's settled you can see that the v2 vitamin is like concentrated on the bottom of it thank you guys so much for joining us and our family for building one of grant's legacy videos lego gummies one of our favorite projects as a family and i hope you guys have a great time building it as well i hope you go home and do this project because it's loads of fun and the payoff you get to eat the product don't eat too many i'm back in the studio and we could not do a lego gummy video without putting a fun twist on it so i brought jared from gold yeller into the studio and we are going to be playing with these little lego gummy guys jared what are we going to be doing with these little lego gummy guys and these heads with all these fun facial expressions i think here's the basic idea okay here's the basics we're going to probably eat the heads off okay and then replace them with lego heads that makes it look like they're talking and then we switch them every single frame and that's what we're gonna do okay so i have taken over the studio i'm going to bring the kids back in we're going to let them play in the studio with these little lego gummy guys and what they're going to do is they get to bite the heads off jared has the courage to be here with us and we're doing lego stop-motion with the kids so he's really brave to be here in the description below there's a link to his channel go check it out there's also a link to my blog where you'll be able to find out what is really happening with these shenanigans in our life and especially kind of how things have been since grant has been gone i'm gonna let the kids go ahead and take one lego gummy guy each bite its head off and then put it back all right okay we bit their heads off we're ready to get started yeah jared needs to bite one off he ate the whole thing that's not biting the head off okay who's not following directions here sorry point at him i'm fired mom okay what do you want your lego gummy guy to say to dad did you see dad yeah in your dreams what do you say i love you what did dad do he makes some jello gummies for me and did you eat them all gone yeah and what do you want to say to dad um okay okay now move your hands out and then push that button right there perfect [Music] okay now push the button this one right here why are you all here no fingers don't eat me goodbye well we want to thank you guys again for joining us for this it's been a year since we lost grant and we just want to thank you for being on this journey with us and continuing to support our projects and the legacy that grant left us grant we really miss you but thanks for what you left us [Music] you", "Uk0Y_r9PGPo": "oh [ __ ] i'm in

"qwgvpuuEvws": "how to preserve homemade gummy bears who doesn't love gummy bears in my house everyone loves him even my husband the only thing holding me back from buying gummies in bulk is that they are too limited in flavor I attended a birthday party hosted by a super hands-on mom and I was amazed by the different flavors she had I asked her how she made her homemade gummies successfully because I failed mine a couple times before she was gracious and kind enough to tell me I can drop by sometime so she can show me I was so excited I was thinking of gummy bears the whole time what can go wrong with homemade gummy bears here are the things I learned I did wrong and I figured these could becoming mistakes so read on one not blooming the gelatin - mixing the bloom gelatin with hot liquid 3 using choppers instead of a spout of measuring cup for using the incorrect ingredients 5 not using corn syrup and citric acid gummy bears recipe easy gummi bear recipe using jello and other easy to find ingredients this recipe is only for one flavor you may replicate this for all the other flavors you want using the same prep time five minutes cook time 15 minutes resting time three days total time three days and twenty ingredients one box jell-o gelatin dessert powder one package Knox and flavour gelatin powder 1/4 teaspoon citric acid 1/4 TSP corn syrup 1/3 cup room temp water other things you will need 2 silicon bear candy molds cooking spray spouted measuring cup instructions step 1 combine the gelatin and citric acid add both the flavored and and flavored gelatin with the citric acid first step 2 balloon the mixture add the corn syrup and water stir gently with a soup spoon until well combined when everything is well combined let it sit for 5 minutes to allow the gelatin step 3 keep the mixture stir the mixture gently again then put it in the microwave for 30 seconds on high temp take it out and stir gently then place it in the microwave again for 15 more seconds repeat the process three times look out for bubbles if any bubbles start to form stop the heating immediately and stir gently as you can step 4 let the mixture rest leave the mixture to set for 10 minutes but stir every two minutes to achieve a clearer mixture step 5 sprays on cooking spray over the candy molds once the candy mixture becomes clearer spray the molds with cooking spray step 6 pour the candy mixture into the candy molds slowly pour the mixture into the molds using your spouted measuring cup do not fill each mold to the brim step 7 allow the gummies to rest let it sit for at least 30 minutes before putting it in the fridge for another 30 minutes step 8 dehydrate the gummies check the gummies and see if they're firm enough to be pushed out of the molds pop them out and place them in a baking sheet make each bear stand upright leave for 48 hours after 48 hours late each bear on their backs and leave for another 24 hours this process will shrink the gummies help dry them out and become more chewy step 9 store the gummies store them in an airtight container and keep them in a cool dry place if the gummies are sticking to each other sprinkle a pinch of

subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of

try all kinds of different flavor combinations the only special thing that you guys are gonna need are these silicone molds and I will put a link down below they are the cutest little things adorable in this pack that I got off of Amazon there are three different colors and it comes with three droppers which make filling molds so easy so you guys I hope that you try out this recipe video and make sure you let me know and give me some feedback how you liked it let me show you guys what you're gonna need in order to make these super cute delicious nutritious gummy bears let's go ahead and get started for the first recipe we're going to be making a citrus blast flavor and for that you're going to need two karekare or large oranges and then you'll need a citrus juicer if you guys want to skip this part and just buy some store-bought orange juice it's okay I'm not judging and since I didn't have any lemons on hand we will be using bottled pure lemon juice and this is organic also need some unflavored gelatin you guys can get this at natural food stores or I can put a link down below where you can find it off of Amazon - this is grass-fed gelatin I just have it transferred into a mason jar here on a technical note pineapple cannot be used in these gummy bears the pineapple will not actually set up with the gelatin and for our sour grape recipe you're going to need some grape juice and some lemon juice and then for our last recipe you will need some home brewed kombucha we have a berry flavor and but not least you guys want to make these into sour gummy bears you're just gonna need some vitamin C powder we got this from Amazon and I will put the knife down for that below as well and we're gonna toss those gummy bears and this vitamin C powder and they're so sour and fun okay let's get rolling [Music] in a saucepan I'm just putting one cup of juice 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then I am slowly whisking in the gelatin at a medium-high heat until the gelatin is all dissolved if you dump it in really fast you're gonna have globs of jello so you want to take it kind of nice and slow and whisk it right in and now using the dropper that came with the molds you're just going to fill up those molds one by one and this is the part where you're kids helping you comes in really handy because it's not difficult at all but it does take a little bit of time so having someone to do that alongside you it's just a really great thing for about 15 minutes okay so I just got these out of the freezer and I think they are ready this is kind of fun if you guys like popping you know those packing bubbles I think that you'll really like doing this too [Music] so I have all three flavors made up and these are ready for vitamin C so I'm just gonna put about a half a teaspoon in with a ziplock baggie and then shake it around it's super simple and it makes some really tasty and fun and sour likes like a healthy version of Sour Patch Kids so just you wanna shake that around zip it up give it a shake me shake you need help with the zipper what oh good job fine to 300 [Music] not really good mmm the orange one is so good why is that tastes like pink yours is

this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "x9ghz27jrCU": "In the 1920s,\nGerman confectioner, Hans Riegel took\nthe world by storm with his invention\nof the gummy bear. These delicious,\nbite-sized treats came in a medley\nof fruit flavors and soon had every man, woman,\nand child hopelessly addicted. In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear. A regular sized\ngummy bear weighs about a tenth of an ounce. The giant gummy bear on the\nstick weighs over half a pound. That's about 88\ngummy bears in one. Beta testing revealed that\nthe prototype giant gummy bear was too unwieldy to\noperate with bare hands. Thus, engineers designed\nthe portability beam, known as the stick,\nto assist consumption. It aids in preservation,\nallowing the bear to be easily wrapped\nup and saved for later. With the implementation\nof the stick, the giant gummy bear has become\na mobile, mess-free delicacy. And the rest is history. Feed your massive\ngummy addiction with a giant gummy\nbear on a stick. Made in the USA and\navailable now at vat19.com.

wanted to see if they're a DIY or D I don't hey guys it's Rachel aka rclbeauty101 and you are watching DIY or D I jumped will retest out crazy DIY projects and see what actually works I really hope these air I D I do because I really want to take a cool Instagram picture of them so I'm going to use these really super nonspecific instructions that I found on the Internet but let's see how it works now what we're going to need is sprite popsicle molds and gummy bears so first things first take off the tops okay so I feel like the instructions are very self-explanatory but let's let's see how it works so I'm gonna take some sprite and put it halfway into each of these containers everytime I don't close the sprite all the way it gets so flat in the morning and then I'd rather yells at me okay now we're gonna take some gummy bears and put them in all of them you could do a design but like anybody got time for that and just kind of drop them in oh oh yes okay wait there's one minute here okay and then I'm just gonna fill it up to the top so now you just put the tops on and put in the freezer I'd mind if I look too much natural again so now I just pop them for the freezer and then leave them in there until they freeze and then take them out and set up like a cool scene thing and then take your cool Instagram pictures because I have very high hopes that these are gonna work okay so I just took him out of the freezer I left them until they got fully frozen and I'm really excited to see how they turned out because so far I don't see any visible flaws so let's see how this works out I'm doing a purple one okay why does my life suck like why is my life for the less than sign okay so we're not gonna do purple in we're gonna go with the green oh that's so disappointing I can't even see the gummy bears it looks so like it like you know when you're driving there's like frost all over the windows and you can't see anything this is so disappointing like I don't know II think if I try to take a good picture of this it would work out like even if I look a professional photographer so the gummy bear popsicle you are Addie I don't I'm gonna put this back and pretend that this never happened click over here to see the infamous pizza cake and then click over here to see the fun fatty candle how many guys to let me know in the comments below right now before you watch these videos which one you think will be a DI do and which one we think will be a DI don't let's see more right so make sure you subscribe to my channel rclbeauty101 and also make sure subscribe to awesomenesstv channel to see more DIY or di don'ts bye", "CYUcoFmFx-Q": "hi welcome to 'angels anything show and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "gZTWR5_hXVo": "damn let me just squeeze on in here yep there we go him welcome to the show hey it's me mr gibbs do you remember this thing that's gummy bear you probably you

ran inside where did what the where did they go did they go down here oh my god this is actually kind of scary i don't like this at all oh why are they all down here where are they going why do they have butt cracks i just i still can't get over the fact that they had they they put on shoes but they didn't put on any other clothes like why here's another bug's bunny oh there he's going oh i want i need to take this bug's bunny out i want to see what he's doing something's wrong about this bug's bunny why is that why does he look like that does he attack me let's see oh he's coming oh god here we go what we need to get rid of these gummy bears i need to give them something else i'm gonna put down the friendly ones maybe it's the hostiles that run away i'm gonna give them gold double barrel shotguns that's what i'm gonna do let's just put down a bunch of those let's see how they like oh yeah that's good okay give him a couple of these yeah there we go let's see what these guys can do against uh i don't know maybe a trevor henderson maybe a cartoon cat maybe one cartoon cat 8 000 health uh they have gold shotguns and they have 100 health seems like a fair fight to me let's go ahead and let them loose all right look out for the cat oh god oh geez oh he's just going through him he's eating them as as one would they are gummy bears come on get him get him there we go very good all right so the shotguns didn't help i'm gonna need to buy a house here we go now this place looks nice this is gonna be a good place for them to settle down and live happy gummy bear lives let me just get up in here okay let's put down a gummy bear he'll put down a mad one there you go all right how's that okay so here we are in our destructible fortress here very looking very fragile um why is there a skull in the fridge what whose house is this okay i'm gonna put down a cat outside all right here he comes now just stay calm don't shoot the floorboards i see you thinking about it it will break okay don't do that oh god i hear him okay be careful just stay in there okay stay in there and you'll be safe i promise oh geez he's breaking things down there he's he's pulling on on stuff oh god hey don't back off the cliff oh you're exposing your butt crack you're exposing it oh jesus don't shoot me guy all right he just put a round in my back hey cartoon cat's given up oh wait he wait what uh the gummy bear just went through the floorboards oh god he he is noticing now there goes gummy bear see i told you i you should have stayed up here and he's dead gummy bear got eaten damn it clearly wasn't a good enough uh structure there let's try this one this one looks much more safe yeah there we go okay um let's open ah there we go okay yeah this is gonna be good all right so we'll put one gummy bear in here bang okay now you stay there look at that cold dead eyes that he's got on this weird stare i just i can't get over i god does he remind me of shrek now there's no way that anything's gonna be able to take this gummy bear this is my last gummy bear all right and i'm not sharing let's go ahead and see let's see if this uh let's put down i don't know let's put down a country road creature oh he might be oh god he's climbing i didn't know country road creature could climb that's news to me i'm gonna go inside and see what's going on in gummy bears head he's shooting the floorboards oh oh he's trying to get him actually maybe if i just crack the door a little bit you know let in a draft oh i opened it all the way okay hold on let me close that just a bit there we go he was getting a little the air was a little stale in there so you know i just want i just want to freshen it up no i don't think there i don't think he can even get in oh that's too bad well it's safe to say this is actually a really safe place to be this is oops oh god as long as i push the right buttons that is there we go all right close that up all right one gummy bear safe uh this guy's having a seizure on top of the roof all right let's see if we can we can get one more safe house out here what is this a rocket can we oh oh all right wait can we can we launch this to space let's see fire oh my god there's actually a rocket in there why did it just peek out and then go back in can we put a gummy bear in there one gummy bear i put him in where is he oh there he is all right it looked oh he's going down to the bottom all right we're launching this gummy bear to space guys here he goes oh jesus oh that's whole that's this is the worst thing that could have happened i thought it was just like a space shuttle i didn't know it would blow up i wonder if the gummy bear being in it just kind of threw it all off maybe that rocket would have been fine if not for the gummy bear hold on i kind of want to see this now there we go we got to open the top first that makes sense now fire now fire come on why is it having such a hard time getting out of there is it constipated what's going on troon one way troon the other way i guess we'll true that way it just peeks out it's prairie dog and it won't go all the way up and then it blew up it's the worst worst missile ever all right well once this radiation goes away oh god it's killing me oh there we go hopefully nothing no funny business happens hopefully there's no zombie gummy bears or anything like that oh god oh geez he's got a sword look at this massive thing some some about his expression is even worse but the most terrifying part is that his ears didn't get any bigger he reminds me even more of shrek now all right well let's see if we can put something down um can i make him i have these things where i can make them more proficient what if i make him perfectly proficient okay he is now perfect if you couldn't already tell yeah he's now perfect all right maximum health 5 000 health um i'm gonna put down one cartoon cat actually no not a cartoon cat cartoon cat's too strong i'm gonna put down one bridge worm let's see what happens here if he gets him with that big sword all right now it doesn't seem like oh god oh what's going on here guys um hmm not not what i thought okay he died he has this big old sword but he didn't even use it hold on let me see if i can let's see how long it takes to kill this thing with this sword one hit it took one hit it took one hit to kill it and he couldn't do it they're not good at hand-to-hand combat or or anything of the sort they need guns they've got a bunch of star wars guns now that'll do them that'll do them well all right gummy bears gummy bears on an army of gummy bears bang there we go small small ears big smile big grin on him god he's terrifying why why who made this god okay let's go ahead and put down um i don't know let's say one siren head ah there we go all right the siren heads loose on the gummy bears now i've got a really good feeling about this uh well actually no they're all right it seems like they're trying to get inside but the fat one's clogging it up oh he made it through okay um siren has just gone wild on him but he is taking a lot of damage they are shooting him that's good guys i think they might actually kill them and kill him as they retreat inside they're all going inside it's i don't know they just they they require shelter i suppose but they're gonna get him real close and then then nothing then nothing oh can he get inside it seems that he can't get inside let's go on in and see what it's like for them in here ah yes okay that's uh they just see a bunch of legs and hands coming through i think siren head can get in if i bring him around this way can he get in oh oh nope still can't still can't get in they're smart i'll give him that the gummy bears they came in here and it seems like they're making their own civilization now uh they've got they're setting up i bet they're getting tomorrow they're gonna have jobs the next day they'll have prostitution bet right that's just how it goes with intelligent beings such as gummy bears um hold on i'm gonna give them some people to rule over all right let's get some citizens in here oh they're shooting at them they're throwing grenades at the citizens they they weren't built for this they're they're kind of mindless i made them that way i took out their brains oh jeez oh no there's a lot going on in there now i really stirred the pot by putting those uh putting those people in there it's really not good there's gummy bears dying they're killing each other i think the gummy bears are afraid of the people they're afraid to be eaten they don't realize that the people they don't feel uh they're not they're actually not real people all right i'm gonna have to take out the siren ad them i'm gonna have to finish them off they really can't do it on their own you know this is wrapping itself up really nicely jesus oh god oh he ate their head but not their ears he didn't eat their ears because they they had already had a bite taken out of their ears that's gross he only wanted the heads god what's what kind of sick freak just eats the heads off the gummy bears come on you got him big gummy bear you can do this okay you're weird ew what's going on with his stomach that's really gross get in there yeah big gummy bears getting them watch out all right i'm gonna say big gummy bear guys i'm gonna save him oh die couldn't save him well a lot just happened here guys you know that's just the way it goes you you get your gummy bears then all of a sudden shrek shows up bugs bunny siren head it's just a lot to unpack um i'm still processing what just happened i think siren had his too he's almost dead he's got a lot of battle wounds from uh from all this from whatever just happened um i think it just goes to show you things that uh the gummy bears aren't they're not very good in a fight you know give them a gun and they can they can stand on their own two feet for a little bit but eventually they're gonna be face down with their butt cheeks showing yeah i really don't know what else to say here all right rate my flip", "8PyPnkbPncY": "cookies world so have you ever flown on an

extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "CE_u3Q1yGs8": "[Music] hey guys so it's Kate and I'm back in the kitchen today and I am making sure free gummies so I've been seeing these all over Instagram and YouTube so I want it to make them and see how they turned out so of course I turn to Amazon to get some silicone molds I ordered bears and then I ordered snakes because I know Hannah like snakes and I like bears so it's a perfect job all right so ingredient-wise let me show you what you're going to need you're gonna need sugar-free jell-o you get the Walmart brand or Target brand whatever brand you want I just happen to have the jello brand and then you're gonna want some plain unflavored jello or gelatin actually and this is the Knox brand I got this at Walmart you're gonna need one packet of the unflavored jello for every box of jell-o you use and I forgot to say this is the point three zero ounce box the four cups the dogs are wound up so we're going to deal with it and then for each box of pudding and unflavored you're gonna need a third of so I'm gonna get this started over here I'm doing two boxes today just because I'm not sure how much I won't have to fill up my mold so you're gonna want to get a little saucepan out and put on your stove and put it on medium heat and then you're gonna add your two packets of your flavored jello and your two packets of unflavored gelatin [Music] and then I'm adding 2/3 cup of water here 1/3 of cup for each package of jello and then you're going to let this warm up and you're going to want to stir everything in here until it is dissolved [Music] okay so it looks like all my jello and gelatin has dissolved in here and I don't really want to bring it up to a boil because you know when it starts boiling jello starts to get frothy and I don't want it to be frothy for when I put it into the molds so I'm gonna pull this off the stove and then we'll get filling our mold up okay so I recruited some help here Hannah's gonna fill the snakes I'm gonna fill the Bears up and we're gonna see how this goes [Music] hi guys so we finished up filling our molds I got like one and a little over a half of a gummy bear mold and hand I got maybe a little over a half of the gummy worm mold filled up so we definitely need more jello or fill our two molds up but that's okay I have the Mod baking sheets which I place the molds on before we start filling them up so it would be easy to put them in the fridge since Silicon trees are pretty floppy so we are gonna go stick these out in the fridge and check on them in a couple hours all right guys probably about an hour to oh I kind of lost track of time I've been longer that has gone by and our jello gummies have set up so I'm gonna get ready to pop them out of try here all right so all right just flip it over and pop them out like this and as you see they just pop her it out you probably get through that thank you so here's one of Hannah's worms they popped out really nicely there you go and I'm gonna get popping like gummi bears out here alright guys so there are my gummy bears let's do a close-up they are so tasty they really do taste really good it's not exactly like a gummy bear but it's pretty darn good see and they look like real gummy bears too so I give this recipe totally to thumbs up also it's quick it's simple and it tastes really good and it's just sugar free jello which is basically no points and barely any calories alright guys I hope you enjoyed that video if you did please give me a thumbs up if you haven't already please subscribe to our Channel and don't forget to share alright guys I'll talk to you later", "JccjODeZjPU": "ladies and gentlemen Rose a gummy bears this gummy bears made from Rosie it's the coolest thing ever so we get some Rosie in I got in our and our measuring cup okay now you gonna have to heat this song because we need to melt gelatin into this so you eat it up all the alcohol it's not going to disappear you can start some alcoholic so we mix in our gelatin right add in some sugar sweep me a little bit okay stir stir stir stir stir stir stir add in some strawberry vodka okay beautiful now come behind it with a little bit of red food coloring cuz you want to get the pink wrap all right and then notice the pink color returns and then we get a gummy mold that's right and we squirt a little bit in each one all right bees and we isn't it triple because these are small let them Harden and

might be however so you know something it brings you back to a specific time in your life I just had one of those moments I don't know it's hard to sit on the floor right now this camera setup is it's such a low level I don't have a chair and my camera is mounted on some books and like oh Lego box that's that's what my camera is set up on it's and then my mind is just on the ground or air so I have to be really low so a lot of times I sent my name of elbows on my F or like my name gaff you know but at baseball practice yesterday and I got a screaming screaming you know this is a fat-free

and God bless I'll see y'all next time", "B7WXjXs8L7U": "oh hey everybody we have another fun activity today what are we doing gummy candy that's right the giant gummy candy maker and what kind of stuff can we make we here make gummy bears gummy worms and gummy fish that is pretty cool so you guys have probably seen our gummy candy videos Evan did the giant gummy worm and Jillian ate a giant gummy bear how was that decoy you didn't even need any of it yeah she didn't really eat that whole thing I think that's kind of impossible especially for a four-year-old yeah you're for now you're 7 you might be able to eat an ear or something like that so now we are gonna make our own gummies look at all the cool things you can make you can make worms different color fish gummy bears and the giant gummy bear I don't think the giant gummy bears as big as the one that we showed in our other video but probably eat it it's pretty big okay guys so we're gonna get this open and show you guys what's inside so here's everything you get in the box what do we have over there gummy bear that looks like it's gonna be pretty big we also have some little heating containers where we're going to mix our gelatin over here we have our molds it kind of looks like Simon swipe their molds right here we have some gummy worms and the fish mold and over here we have our little ice tray that we have to fill up with ice and right here we have our heating bowl and you have to plug that in and Jillian's gonna get that ready and of course we have our instructions yeah you should always follow the instructions that are listed don't make up your own recipes unless you want a mess so there's a bunch of different gummies you can make you can make a sour gummy vitamins gummies or even energy gummies using an energy drink like redbull but I think we're just gonna make regular gummi bears today and we're gonna try something different too we have these molds and we also have our marble ice cube molds that we got in our loot crate box and we're gonna try and make some Marvel gummies - mmm so we have two of these heating trays because while you're pouring one thing of gelatin you can also be mixing up the second flavor right here or if you lose one but we're not losing these right so before we use any of this stuff we need to give it a good washing okay so the first thing we have to do is we have to assemble this Gillian's putting the tray together so it doesn't fall apart that would not be good okay did it before we put the molds on top we need ice to put into it because that's gonna act as our cooling agent and it's gonna cool whatever is on top let's press the tray with some ice okay so we filled up our tray with ice and now Evans going to put the molds on michey mob and you want to make sure you put enough ice but you also want the molds to lay flat because you are going to be pouring the gelatin into the molds and if it's slanted it might run out we're gonna put our little cauldron with the metal bottom because metal is a conductor and now we get to mix our ingredients so what do we need so we have a bunch of jell-o gelatin we actually need three ounces to make one batch we have mango here unflavored gelatin yes and you also need some unflavored gelatin you need four ounces and they come in this little package there's four envelopes that are one ounce each so you need to mix 4 ounces of unflavored gelatin with three ounces of flavored gelatin how much water do we have to put in the water half a cup of water okay put it in look at that nice and warm now this pot is hot so be careful so any goes the unflavored gelatin and now it's time for the flavored stuff I have to take a snip jefes always smell so good thank you now for the flavored gelatin it all looks the same stir it a little bit and then I'll let you stir them okay I've been stirring up the mixture in our gummy cauldron I smell gummy we don't want a lumpy gummy so we better stir this pretty good it says stir until mixture is runny get rid of that I've got some clumps in there you each like mommy's gravy hey now I always do it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't messy yeah Gillian's finishing up on the stirring so it has a little spout here to make it four easy pour now let's see if I could do it without spilling it'll be a miracle if I can there's a job on my table maybe I can't see what I'm doing oh we got a Siamese fish going on connect it up ahead doesn't matter yeah matters oh maybe we should let the kids board yes even decorated the bowl look at that it's not any different than my muffins I just clean up after all right so we got a mess going on here let me see if I can do this one okay I'm gonna fill up some of these oh sure take the big fat shape that's easy I had a choice to need that this stuff is pretty thick not just me but you made it okay so this is a little messy oh well you must be having a lot of fun then okay I think that's good for that one all right so I got our marble is cubed molds these might be a little better because they are bigger we've got orange so let's let's do the thing okay so I'm going to do these two and so Gillian's filling up the ice cubes and what we should be doing is making our second batch with our extra one which one you want a blue one okay blueberry on these boxes of jell-o they're actually six ounces so we need to cut that in half in order to get the three ounces that we need I'm gonna pour in the unflavored Wow Wow four at a time look at that that is called skilled Jillian's gonna put in two three ounces of blueberry and let's stir that sucker up time for mommy to that makes more messes good just don't aim well it's a little bit better in texture okay so this is a pretty messy but I'm gonna use the spoon this time and it might work a little better gotta get the little ear we've got a big mess going on here these worms working a little tail there to get that just gonna give them some blue paws we're mixing up our third badge with a resist there goes there's green Joe is stirring up the green stuff oh okay so something's going on with our mixture here it's pretty thick it's not really flowing into the mold smoothly so maybe we're not heating this up enough I let it sit here in the pot and it is getting more runny so I think we were taking it out before it really got high we're gonna have some clumpy bears and some clumpy fish okay let's see if this pours any better this time oh it's actually going in now oh no it's much better we'll make a green gummy face so when you mix colors you have to make sure that the previous color has already solidified otherwise when you mix the next color it's just gonna mix all together become a big dark mess so we have our green face and our blue paws this is too thick right now not quite there yet okay let's fill it an Ironman face this Iron Man doesn't have enough so I'm gonna add some red to it see how it looks so we got some bloody worms we got some chunky bears so these things are cooling now we filled all the molds this is our first try Wow it's kind of a failure but we're gonna see what comes out of this and see if they're edible these bears are not gonna have ears sorry they're mommy's trying to get his ear mommy's goal there perfect but he's gonna have one ready yeah all right so Evans going to karate you see you later buddy it's our bear and I'm gonna fill the rest of it with the rest of this read that we have make a red body it's going over the head too I guess the ears are gonna be red of a nice layer of red okay so I just poured in some yellow into our bear and now he's got several layers so Jillian's removing all the molds from our little ice tray the ice is still down there so they just come out and since the mold is nice and flexible they should just pop out everything's gonna be connected to each other yeah I think so we kind of overfilled them a years he's a ball bear that's got a violet and here are our conjoined bears this one has monkey hair no one's lumpy bear let's see the worms oh look at that it's a worm in slime Oh Julian killed it she dissected the worm mums got the good Bears pretty good eye man oh please I made these you made those you might do I didn't make the green we have some good ones over here the ones I made I'll show you what I made I made these guys Marvel well these ones are gonna be thick they were not meant to be candy they're meant to be ice this woman is look at that whole face that is the thing then we have fist we have an orange Iron Man and we have a red Iron Man and we have a couple shields so the thing we learned is you have to make sure your gelatin mixture is melted all the way before you pour it in and when you do pour it in you have to be very careful not to pour too much quality beer but I do actually like these bloody bears okay Joey is gonna try the worm what are your thoughts you did or where it is okay but the texture is a little weird all right I'm gonna try the red because that one we actually did right there's not enough flavor it's not as sweet as a gummy bear okay so we finished tasting these we're gonna wait for Evan to come home he'll try one of these and we're just gonna finish our giant bear from karate I was karate it was good he worked up an appetite for gummies I guess no would you recommend that he eats these Joe yeah he's gonna eat the bloody gummy bear know what it's like now is it no guys took my Javanese tastes more like jello than the gummy I would have to agree with that I think it doesn't have quite as much sugar okay but he likes it apparently because he just took another one so you got the big thick Iron Man head and instead of putting up I was gonna say instead of putting that whole thing in your mouth take a little bite but it looks like a Lego brick what are you eating you took it apart but before we go we have to go see how our giant gummy bear is doing the exact number okay so here's the giant gummy bear let's bring it over to the table we had it in the fridge to harden a little bit well bring it over to our messy candy workshop over here this thing has a bunch of different colors hopefully hopefully it comes out of here like it is nice smiling green face oh I just smashed the word Wow see let's press his face let's go bear CPR okay it's coming out I got the leg Oh it's a bear that they had I see the head coming there it is he's got a green round face but it actually says bear here on this chest in case you didn't know stay away from my gummies bear it looks messy but it actually comes off like Jillian's gonna try the bear out let's go take a big bite of the ear just like you did with that other one there it is oh it's bringing back memories ah let's see it we've got what is that lime cherry lemon orange and more cherry and some blueberry feet so why don't you bite the foot try that blueberry foot and you can even just pull his hand off like this and you can eat his hand look at that daddy - perfect gummy worm I could sell this on eBay so I think we're done with this gummy stuff we're gonna save this maybe we'll try this again later maybe I'll put some hot peppers in here do some surprise gummies yeah surprise gummy challenge okay guys so that was the Greek giant gummy candy maker it was a little bit messy if you guys want to make your own gummies you can get this candy maker or you can just buy gelatin and make jello thanks for watching and we'll see you guys next time", "3vebCu3Qiu4": "[Music] welcome to another episode of science is everywhere the home edition my name is Maria and I'm from Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose and if you are watching us live right now go ahead and put your name in the comments say hello I'm moderating at the same time and I would love to give you a greeting back and just see what scientists are out there so this week we have been doing a whole bunch of different activities and reading books that have to do with water so of course we're going to go ahead and bring that into science as well and I thought you know this is a great time to do the monster bear experiment and to talk about osmosis because that has to do with water so no reason to be scared we say monster bear because of perhaps how this experiment is going to turn out but no Bears will be harmed in this experiment so let's go ahead and talk about our different materials that we're gonna need then we'll go ahead and set up do our experiment we'll come back and we'll talk about how the experiment went and what osmosis is and what that has to do with what we're doing okay so you see laid out here all the different things that we're going to need for this experiment except for one thing I'll tell you that in just a second so going through these really quickly you're going to need some salt it doesn't really matter what kind I have some iodine salt but you really don't need that so just regular table salt works fine you're going to need some water so I have my spigot here you'll also need some sugar just regular sugar that you cook with three different containers and I have glass ones so if you've got glasses I've got ramekins just something smaller make sure that these are ones that can be put in the microwave safely so nothing metal you will also need a tablespoon we're going to do a little bit of measurement today going to need just a regular spoon and this is for stirring and then last but certainly not least I shouldn't say last second to last you're going to need some gummy bears now I got ones that are all the same color that way we can see maybe what changes throughout this experiment so just like some other experiments we've done one of the hardest parts of this one is not to eat your experiment so these are for experiments not for eating and then the one thing that you don't actually see here which is behind the camera is a microwave so you're going to need one of those as well alright so now that we have all of our materials including the one that's going in the camera looks good and set up our experiment so I got kind of a jumpstart on this experiment I went ahead and filled my lil ramekins with about a cup of water so you can see that there is kind of up to the line and I filled all three of them with the same amount of water so that's how we're going to start and then two of these were actually going to change so one is going to stay just water and then these other two we're going to change with the salt and the sugar so let's go ahead and get to that part of the experiment and then we will do our experiment hope you're feeling brave there bears let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] all right my fellow scientists we have saved our bears from all the different polls that they had been swimming in all evening and I kept their labels so we know what exactly they were all swimming in at the time you'll also notice that I left an original bear so we know what they look like before the experiment so osmosis let's talk about that what is that well that is when you have something like water move from one material through what's called a membrane to another area or material so let's think about this you could have an area that's got a lot of stuff in it then you have that membrane or like a door that you would walk through then the other side maybe doesn't have a whole lot of stuff in there well when that door is open those two sides want to even each other out so they're gonna come together and they're gonna mix until they have something that's closer to if not even on both sides well that's what happened to the bear that's water that has been moving through that membrane or that door so for example we have the bear that was in water well I said that was water moving right we noticed we actually dropped the bear in the water and then we went ahead and watched it grow watched it absorb water well why did it absorb water why did osmosis happen there well inside the bear there is a little bit of water but there's a lot of sugar and there's gelatin well the water when it comes in contact with that bear it wants to get into that bear because there's not a whole lot of water there again what's even itself out so the bear starts to expand as I start soaking up that water just like a sponge would now this is after you know a few hours think about what would happen if we left it in there for days wouldn't even still be there would it get to a certain size and then start breaking up maybe something you want to try at home okay so what about sugar water because I said there's sugar in bear but I also just said there's sugar in the water well there's more sugar in the bear so the water is still gonna want to go into that bear and so you're gonna get that bear get a little bit bigger what about the salt because there's no sugar in there well salt is actually smaller than sugar so when we dissolve that salt we actually had more salt in the water then there was sugar in the batter so again the waters gonna think there's more room outside and it's gonna start leaving the bear on the salt side so other ways you can see house Moses happening you've ever been in a pool for way too long when it was your fingers it kind of puffy and wrinkly right that's osmosis the waters evening things out you're actually absorbing that water crazy right or if you have dried fruit you then put it into a glass of water what he thinks gonna happen that fruit is going to absorb and osmosis is going to happen so it's going to get bigger water she's gonna enter into that piece of fruit you could also try this with dry vegetables if you have them so that is how osmosis could work with bears so again I hope you enjoyed this will go ahead and put a hashtag down below if you want to show us your bears if you use other gummy animals or if you use different liquids you could try that as well and see which way things travel always interesting to see so thank you for tuning in we very much appreciate our time and hopefully you did as well and we will see

wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "SZuJbQ4tcnY": "this

knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see

dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

bears inside my peer pressure rosin bag I go over here open up my plate excuse it in there and I'm gonna get this in the center of these plates I can't do it one-handed so it will be very bad start off a little bit of pressure oh sure Jews I don't expect no big downpour like I said this is 6 grams so I'll probably get about one point three grams of return from it somewhere around there 1.2 1.3 man definitely looking good a little more pressure now be careful though because you had too much pressure you will bust the bag or the parchment paper this is really strong parchment paper it's not from the grocery store this is from peer pressure also but you can still only take so much before you rip it wide open alright guys so we're at about the 2 minute mark [Applause] [Applause] so there we have it looking good peace", "QqGWuQXJbcI": "hello [Music] um uh [Music] um [Music]", "D7xYWUnC8UE": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make gummy candy we're going to be using the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker and I'm going to be showing you how to make the little tiny gummy bears and this giant one so let's get started so when I opened the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker what I found inside were four individual trays like this and then four of these silicone liners so we've got worms fish and then two gummy bear components it comes with two of these heating pots and then this is the heating machine part that and that all the heat comes from that metal part in the center there it also came with a large gummy bear mold and a set of fairly exploit Ori instructions so I'm going to go through my recipe on how to make the gummy bears using this machine so the first thing we want to do before we start making our gelatin mix is we need to fill up the each of the trays with a layer of ice so I'm going to put about half of the container in make sure you want to make sure that your ice is level so it doesn't make any indents into your gummies so I've filled up the other ones already and now I'm going to turn my machine on the my one thing about this kit is that this machine does take quite a while to heat up that's my one complaint but I'm going to give you an alternative when I show you how to make the Jumbo gummy bear so into this pot is going to go 1/2 a cup of water and that's about its maximum capacity as well and then I have one container of a for serving amount of jello which is 85 grams and it's going in and in with it as well is three envelopes of gelatin which equal about 21 grams so you just put all that into the pot give it a stir and then you have to wait so the waiting is going to take probably about 10 minutes and it's going to start to thicken up right away and don't worry I started worrying right away that it will I'd ruined it but just you have to wait till it gets the pot gets really hot and it will get hot so be careful that you don't hurt yourself and you want to make sure that all the gelatin has dissolved in the water so when that has happened I'll be back to show you what it should look like so my gelatin mixture has been heating now for about 10 minutes and I can tell it's ready to go because it's real iqua fide and also the gelatin is in here is dissolved completely so that tells me it's ready to be poured into the molds but it's gonna take that off now another slight complaint here is that the little heating pot is a little bit unstable so I don't want to be pouring this hot liquid while the heating pot is kind of a sided so I'm just gonna turn it off and take it and put it over to the side now really handy are the little spouts on the side here so I can just gently pour them into the molds and fill them up so it takes about 15 minutes for these smaller ones to set so I'm gonna fill up all of my molds here and then I'm going to show you in the meantime while these ones are setting I'm gonna show you how to make the Jumbo Teddy the Jumbo gummi mold to make the giant gummy bear we're going to be using berry blue jello you can use any flavor that you'd like to and it takes two packages and these are for serving packages and they equal a hundred and seventy grams in total we're going to be using six packages of the Knox gelatin unflavored and that equals 42 grams 1 cup of water and the Jumbo mold that's included in the machine kit so let's put this together and make the giant gummy bear so in this one I'm going to show you a different way to make the gelatin and you can do the same for the smaller jellies that I showed you previously if you don't have the machine so all you have to do is pour your unflavored gelatin and your flavored gelatin into a microwaveable dish or a bowl or one like this I like this one just because it has a pouring spout then taking a whisk just whisk it up together and then you're going to put this mixture into the microwave for between a minute and two minutes and what you're going to be looking for is a nice liquid consistent seikhs that's going to start to gel up again like it did previously and making sure that all the little crystals have just melted into the liquid so I'm going to do that now and then I will be back now that my mixture has mixed together completely I'm going to pour it into my gummy bear mold and then once I've got it all in my mold it's going to go into the freezer for the quickest solidification you can leave it on the counter that's just fine but putting it into the freezer will take about half an hour to 45 minutes so I'm gonna pop that in and then I'll be back to show you how to unmold your little ones which are probably going to be ready now once it's been about 15 minutes all you have to do to check to see whether or not your gummies are set it's just to give your mold a little wiggle and I can tell that they're nice and solid so to remove them from the silicone mold it's really quite easy you just can pick them up pop it out like that and then just pry away with your fingers like that so our final step is to remove the jumbo gummy bear from the mold so this is just like I did with the silicone molds so you're just going to pull back on the sides and then pull it out and it's as simple as that so I'll be right back to close the video so there you go everybody how to make a gummy candy using a gummy candy maker now what I liked about the gummy candy maker was the molds I thought they were really cute and I especially liked the Jumbo mold but what I found disappointing was that the maker didn't come with any gelatin and the length of time that heating up the gelatin using the machine than it comes with it just took a long time with what you can do in the microwave for 1/2 two minutes so that's my review of the gummy candy maker I hope you enjoyed the video remember to give it a thumbs up if you liked what you saw and if you'd like us to review a different product make sure you leave that in the comments I'd love

recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "E3aJKfETuaQ": "who wants to talk CBD this guy does and let me tell you what today I've got the fun stuff the CBD gummy bears oh yeah [Music] what's up guys it's your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaco TV where you watch decide and vape and as said earlier I've got some gummy bears today but they have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear enjoyment just like I do um with these I'm not gonna lie there's a whole lot of things that you can say and you can't say about CBD because obviously like we covered the FDA hasn't approved of anything but let me tell you what they do for me what they do for me I'll leave these at night right before bed like a half hour hour before bed somewhere around there I'm out like a light I sleep I mean I'm out I used to be the guy who tossed and turn to go to bed sit there flip through my phone for you know an hour or two no I go right to bed I also have a day job believe it or not this isn't the only gig work at a warehouse I walk around a lot a lot a lot and with all that walking around you know I got aches and pains these these help with the aches and pains okay um and that's that's personal experience that's just me telling you again the FDA didn't doesn't say that's what it will do what it won't - etc etc I'm just telling you from personal experience so again check the description below you're gonna find a link delivered directly to the product get yourself something all right trust me get yourself something just try it do yourself a favor and just try so until next time it needs your boy big J for VAP code TV where you watch decide invade get you some gummy bears and until then I am out

right I've never done that I've also never skied before which you know is a bit of Carlos in in Colorado you know it's like they say a Colorado family that's happy not skiing is like a Catholic family that's happy [Applause] I can but in erskine I've never done meth before I thought about it never done it and here's why like I said Colorado used a huge meth problem but that is until the Colorado antiemetic project okay which was a seriously psays commercial was billboards which drove many shoots down in Colorado like 90% this is true with the tried and true method of scaring the [ __ ] out of teens mostly right and there were there were a lot of like versions of it but my favorite was there was a billboard right next to my high school which was a picture of just like the gross grungy sink splat covered in blood okay and it said at the top you never think you try to peel off your own skin [Music] meth will change that first of all very effective right like I will never do that as a result of that I'm hoping that you will ever do that as a result of that and maybe some use it's too late I'm saying you look like you can hide but I'm saying you look like you could be possibly the biggest myself too though you know I mean to wear skinny popular but you never see me try to feel our own skin meth will change that what I would love to see would be like a similar style of PSA but for like way less dangerous drugs you know like you never think you try to peel break with your teeth and then use the peel grape sort of like lick bomb on your lips because it looks stupid or chapped

who tried to get my parents to put me on adderall to like tell me picture what I was like as I could like picture like Sid from Toy Story meets Chicken Little like do but in a hurry and I have those glasses right but not just the glasses I had glasses with like that strength action strapped right back here right because I was lived a very active lifestyle okay I was doing this a lot apparently with my head and there also they were flexible glasses rent like literally the wires in the classes would bend right because my parents didn't trust me and so there was and there was another girl in my class in the first grade her name was Rachel Wilson and she also had glasses and one day I was just playing with my glasses just bending them as one doesn't want to do and she was I kind of like how do you do that I was like I'm just do it she was like oh snap I went to the principal's office I'm kidding I'm kidding she's rich it was yeah I don't know my heaven on man I am done much cocaine and I've like weed though I've never gotten like crazy with it when an exception which is that when I was back home in Denver over this last Christmas I was hanging on my friend sacks basement he told me Oh Sam by the way that is 50 milligrams for those of you who don't regularly eat marijuana gummies think about like this like in terms of alcohol like eating a 50 milligram gummy is like if instead of doing like a couple shots of alcohol to like kick off your night if instead you just like slam your head in a minivan doing are doing around like it's inscrutable passage maybe the gummy puts on the movie 24 days later and passes out 20 dessert that's life if a zombie movie was written by someone who had just taken a 50 milligrams gummy okay so I'm losing my mind zombies are getting hacked up with machetes that one skinny dudes hooking people's eyes down zombies are eating people's necks and then the climax of the movie this dude who's like chained to a military base and it's grimy zombies it's like it's just people killing people and I look over at my past our friend Zach and I'm like he's of people right settle down when it comes to peace for this girlfriend I'm standing there [Music] because we make eye contact right she like pushes some water thank you and we make contact and I'm like I know that I'm flying other higher than I've ever been but I like I feel like I get closer to earth and we just like we don't we don't say anything but we just like and I'm like I'm so conflicted cuz I'm like I'm in love but I don't know how to tell my friend my friend Zach doesn't have a

today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to

cannabis infused lifestyle and i will see you guys next time you", "sngfzl4ccjM": "this is the world's spiciest gummy bear it contains 9 million Scoville a1 chip challenge contains 1.5 million scovilles that means one gummy bear is equivalent to 6 1 chip challenges yeah so literally this box you see how tiny anna's gummy bear is i'm just very surprised that it contains 9 million Scoville that's literally 900 times spicier than a jalapeno pepper yeah so I figured the only way to do this properly is to slowly work my way up there so we have different gummies here this is a regular gummy bear as you can see the only difference between this and this is this one has a dynamite in the middle that's probably a pretty insane so I made that but in the meantime let's open this Wow utilize the space here huh alright here it is oh my goodness that looks so intentional gummy bear we're great I'm gonna enjoy this while lack sour patch kids I'm gonna enjoy this [Music] mmm sour oh my goodness can you believe it how does this contain nine million schoolgirls I'm so scared I'm literally like scared all right next up we have some life savers I need this to save my life mmm last but not least on the gummies break them we got gummy worms was complete now time for the real deal the one chip gummy bear challenge first things first we got the pepto-bismol hmm it helps if you want to do some spiciness it helps to drink pepto-bismol like 30 minutes before so that's what I did for the main event let's open this gummy bear huh huh just like this Oh Oh oh my gosh look at that look at this oh yes oh I feel like they literally took a whole bunch of like plutonium hot sauce melted it that's not a good smell I can tell you that hey oh it's so crazy how that little thing can pack so much of a punch you know like it's not still gets is all oil that's it this is all spicy oil okay that's what makes it intense I feel like you take a whole bunch of extracts from the ghost peppers and Carolina Reapers and put it into that tiny teddy bear alright everybody this is the one gummy bear just to let you know it's not fake it's literally a gummy bear with the dynamite that's how we know 3 2 1 you're here the juices [Music] it's like I'm literally eating hot sauce you take a whole bunch of hot sauce and you eat it that's what it feels like I'm doing right now [Music] okay yeah this is good my tongue is burning that's the only sensation that's that's effective it yes yes yeah I'm feeling it yeah it's good at it it takes a while but then like oh hi my goal there's so last couple minutes without taking milk or ice oh this is bad dude like I feel like it's stuck in my tongue like all the starch and like all the sugar I guess it's just stuck in my tongue like glue that's crazy how that small gummy bear did this much to me I'm like this much bigger than the gummy bear oh yeah oh the good one that's a good one that was a good baby that was a good baby that was good baby that was a good baby bear it's getting worse it always happens every time I breathe it gets worse Wow look at me yeah can you see the pain can you see the pain huh can you see the pain in my eyeball I'm sorry this is disgusting but I did this for you can we get this video to 77 likes I bet you we can't oh my gosh dude hey girl I gotta tell you the truth though I'm doing good without milk I don't believe that is 9 million scovilles because I feel like the one chip was a lot spicier but it does hurt it just does hurt I will never eat uh know that gummy bear fear in my life dude that was absolutely disgusting and gross I'm gonna get some milk my stomach is in pain ah geez that felt a lot better oh dear all right cool I feel a lot better I mean not a hundred percent but that was pretty spicy will not do that again okay I think I did it well it's good it was a bad I wasn't that bad I just you know what they say enjoy the pain Stacey", "hOfaW5pjKaw": "Guess what we're doing today! Today we are going to make...\nSome super easy gummy Strawberry Valentine Dog Treats! Look at all the dogs in here. We're ready to make some treats. This is actually a really simple easy recipe. There's like three (3) ingredients and that's it . We're gonna show you guys\nhow to make these real quick. if you want to see some more\nValentine's treat videos, there will be a link up in the cards\nand down in the video description below. If you are new, don't forget to hit that 'Subscribe' button.\nClick that Bell to turn on notifications, so that you can be notified whenever\nwe put up amazing new videos. Let's make some treats! You're waiting patiently aren't you? Shelby's like, \"I'm being very patient!\"\n\"Can we just get on with it?\" So the first thing we're gonna want to do is\ntake about a cup, of chopped up strawberries. But first, we'll see if everybody will eat one. How about strawberry, no dip?  Oh, man! Oh!  She ate it! She actually ate it!\nShe didn't spit it out! Strawberry, no dip?\nI know you'll eat it with no dip. How about you?\nStrawberry, no dip? What was that? Oh!  You just wanna lick It?\nWait a minute... We've been here before, haven't we?\nYou liked strawberries! You... Weren't sure about strawberry. You can eat it. You really...\nNo!  This is for Oakley! You can eat it, here!\nHere, try it!  There you go! Or take it in the other room.\nThat's fine too, as long as you eat it! Anyway, we are gonna take one (1) cup of strawberries\nchopped up, and I know this seems silly. We're gonna take it, pour it into this\none (1) measuring cup and then, we are going to fill this measuring cup,\nup with water. We're gonna do that real quick. Now we have our strawberries, in our water. We filled it to the one (1) cup line. Basically what we're doing right now is,\nwe are going to make strawberry juice. It's pretty much what we're doing. We're gonna take the strawberries,\nwith the water in this one (1) cup. We're gonna pour them into this\n'Nutri-Bullet' and turn it into... Like I said, pretty much strawberry juice. (blender sounds) So now we pretty much have...\nStrawberry juice. The dogs are like, \"Wait!  What is this?\"\n\"Can we drink it?\" Kind of, you're kind of gonna drink it.\nKind of! The next thing we were going to do is,\nwe are going to take half (1/2) a cup of water. We are going to heat it on the stove\nand we are going to pour in, all four (4) of these packets\nof plain unflavored gelatin. We're going to whisk it together\nuntil this is all dissolved. That's what we're gonna do now! Alright!  The gelatin is in the water now. We are just going to continuously whisk this... Until it is all dissolved! Now once, it's all nice and dissolved.\nIt's kind of gonna look like this. We're gonna take that strawberry juice we made,\nwe're gonna pour this in, whisk it together and\nremove it from the heat. Now to make it a little easier to pour,\nwe have poured it back into our one cup mixture and now we are going to pour this,\ninto our silicone heart tray. We're gonna fill each\nof these, about halfway. What do you think?\nThings can turn out amazing? They're like, \"We're all really patient!\"\n\"We want to know what this is gonna do? So, we're gonna go ahead and take this and try not to make a giant mess. Oh!  I already made a giant mess! I should probably set\nthe camera down while I do this... And now our silicone tray is full. We are going to take this and we are going\nto put it in the refrigerator for... I would say at least three (3) hours.\nEasiest if you just do it overnight. I'm actually doing it overnight.\nBut I would say three (3) to four (4) hours, before they will actually be firm enough\nthat you can remove them, from the silicone mold. Which means you gotta\nhave some patience, honey! You and the rest of the girls\ngot to have some patience! While we're waiting for those...\nLet us know down in the comments below, what do you guys want to see us, make next? Suggest some treat videos for us to make,\ndown in the comments below. You'll never know, but we just might make\none of your suggestions next! Alright!  So we left them in,\novernight and they are done! They're pretty cool.\nSo these are the strawberry ones, but as you guys saw the video last night,\nI was reminded that we have a few dogs that don't necessarily like strawberry\nwithout something else in it, so I also made some plain ones with\njust a little bit of chicken broth in them. I'm going to show you guys more recipes\non different types of gummies you can do as well. I figured, I better have these (plain) just in case,\nthey really don't want to eat these (strawberry). But, they turned out nice and jiggly. Jiggly! I know you want to try it so bad.\nThey're nice, jiggly and very firm. They smell good! For those of you that are gonna ask,\nif you can eat these as well? Yeah!  If you want to eat them, you can eat them.\nThey're basically 'Jell-o Jigglers'. They don't have any real sugar in them.\nThey just have the natural sugar from the fruit in them. The girls are gonna go ahead and\ngive them a try and see, what they think. Are you girls ready?\nEverybody's ready to see what they think? Alright, let's do it! Sit! So first, we are going\nto give Memphis one of the... Ah!  Wait!\nOne of the strawberry ones. I think she's just gonna...\nThat's exactly what I thought, you were gonna do! Sit! She's like, \"These are great!\"\n\"I will eat them all!\" Can you speak?  Speak! That's a stomp!  Speak!\n(growls) That was really close!  Speak!\n(barks) Yeah!  Good girl! Okay, now you get one of the chicken broth ones.\nCould you eat it a little slower? Yeah, like that.\nNibble, nibble, nibble... Yeah!  Little nibbles. Good stuff!  Was it good?\nWas it good stuff? Alright!  I think Memphis says,\n\"They're a win!\" Alright! Will she eat the strawberry one? You don't want it?\nWant the strawberry one? Maybe? Okay, I'm gonna let it go.\nYou're not gonna spit it out this time. You're gonna eat it? She's like \"Mmm... \"I'm gonna take it over here,\"\n\"and think about eating it.\" Shelby, you want this one instead? Shelby, you want this one instead? She's like, \"Yeah!  I want that one instead!\" (laughter) Yeah, how do they know?\nThat one was better, wasn't it? Hi!  Say hi to the camera!\nThat one was way better, wasn't it? She's like, \"That one was way better.\"\n\"This one...  I'm not so sure!\" You can eat it. It's really edible.\nIt's just strawberry. No?  You don't want that one? She's like, \"I want it, but...\" \"I don't really like strawberries without dip!\" Look at her attempt like,\n\"I could eat this...\" \"But how about, no?\" Alright, let's see if Oakley\nwill eat the strawberry one. Alright, It's Miss Oakley's turn.\nThat's a strawberry one. You're gonna eat that one? Even though it's strawberry? Maybe...  Nah! She's like, \"I don't know...\"\n(chuckles) \"I really want to eat it because,\"\n\"everybody else ate it!\" \"But, I'm not really sure if I should eat it\"\n\"because it's kind of a weird tasting!\" Here, let me get you the other one.\nWanna try the other one? Try this one... She's like, \"Oh!  That's better!\"\n\"That's more like chicken.\" Oh yeah! \nShe's like, \"I can eat this one!\" \"I'll eat this gummy right up!\" \"Maybe I'll try this one again... Nope!\" Yeah!  You're like \"The other one's better, too!\"\nHuh?  Yeah! I should remember, that you guys aren't\na huge fan of strawberry. They like strawberry with other stuff in them, but I think because the gelatin was unflavored\nit literally was strawberry flavored. Those two aren't big fans of strawberries,\nunlike Memphis who will eat anything. Alright, you guys!  Well there you have it!\nStrawberry Gummy Valentine's treats for dogs.

Goodbye guys!", "1tWIrhG9YGM": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make alcoholic gummy bears these are so simple so yummy let's go [Music] a small saucepan and put in a third of a cup of water one packet of jell-o or jelly crystals something like this then add 15 grams of unflavored gelatin and just let that sit for five minutes to glyco phi and absorb the water now the unflavored gelatin here that i use is this kind now for those that don't know what unflavored gelatin does that's what makes jello become gummy so if you just use jello it'll be very wobbly and fall apart you put the unflavored gelatin in it becomes gummy you get the texture of the gummy bear all right even now that this has glorified and absorbed the water turn the heat on to medium want to bring this to the boil and have this dissolve the crystals all right that looks ready now turn the heat off and we'll get to the next part and for however many colors you want just do this with each different color now get something else like a measuring cup that has a poorer on it and add about anywhere from a quarter to a third of a cup of vodka now add this to it now get your molds of little bears and just pour the mixture straight in just leave these here on the counter for about 15 minutes so they can set just slightly and then transfer them to the freezer where you leave them for 20 to 25 minutes if you want to only put them in the fridge leave them in the fridge for about 45 minutes to an hour and just take them straight out as you can see alcoholic gummy bears the gummy they wouldn't give to do that if they were only jello young and any other colors that you've chosen oh there you go now it's a party so you've got tons of alcoholic gummy bears look at them beautiful if you like these oh yeah this little dude yummy yummy [Music] oh so good he's drinking time I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "HixZD18L0lA": "what's up everybody your

your life that's the good [ __ ] I love it but we'll get into this like I said we get a ton of messages I don't answer them all personally thank you for everything but we're gonna go over some of the most common questions that we get excuse me eating a lot of food these days so snacks all right first one gummy bears why do I eat the gummy bears just like them there is no physiological benefit that I am trying to attain from eating the gummy bears like I'm not like hot I can't wait for that [ __ ] Moonie 5 gummy bears and get like an insulin spike no gummy bears are not good for you there if you eat too many of them [ __ ] your [ __ ] up in there you'll be [ __ ] for days and all this and people were talking about it and I don't eat that many gummy bears ain't like a handful of them go get like a handful like eight put like five in my pre-workout like eat three that's it I eat my gummy bears around pre-workout time I love it they make me smile they make me feel good about myself they doing my favorite candy since I was a kid my mom you know whenever like Christmas and Easter and all that [ __ ] gummi bears whenever candy stores like still exist you don't see them too often now at least around here like you be would go into the gummy bears store they'd have like the [ __ ] the wall of like things you flip up and pull out and put in the bag and all that [ __ ] yeah I haven't seen those in a while but always got a ton of gummies it's my [ __ ] and to this day you know being a pro bar being a bodybuilder in general you deprive themselves of the things you like gummy bears whenever I died it was one thing I didn't need a lot of does it's not good for you also making my coffee away like no sugar no creamer just black [ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks but those are the things you take out of your life so that you can look good naked so now that I'm not doing that season setting getting jacked and tan looking that's much tan I need the gummi bears no physiological benefit zero none don't care what it does just like to eat them if you're looking for insulin spike or some type of benefit from a carbohydrate you can drink [ __ ] Gatorade you can get a rapid glycogen loader car power drink your pre-workout I take those drink the Gatorade might mix it with [ __ ] Gatorade and it's still the gummy bears in why because like the taste they make me feel good so that's it also the deadlifts and gummy bears sure so that shirt big sellin shirt for us we love it that came from time whenever the deadlifts and gummy bears thing whenever I was going through a pretty rough time in my life whenever I was going through the divorce with my ex and me you know having full custody of kids and being super dad and having to do all this stuff it was really rough it sucked and had a lot of crazy emotions [ __ ] with my head and I thought you know I needed to I needed to go to a place that would like let all my aggression out let all my [ __ ] anxiety let all my let all my emotions pour out and I was like I'm gonna go to the gym I'm gonna eat gummy bears train back the deadlifts and pull-ups and all the hardship sweat my [ __ ] balls off and left listen him out so that's what I did that's where that shirt came from that shirt that is just such a wild success and everybody loves it because if they go eat gummy bears and do deadlifts and listen to metal and do hard [ __ ] and make you sweat bro that's good [ __ ] makes bill glad that came from a really shitty time so you know how if you hear those things that like good can come from really bad places and really bad situations that it did and that was where it came from I was able to go to the gym just eat handful gummy bears do set it deadlifts we put up and put on more weight and for gummy bears do deadlifts that's my [ __ ] loved it so that's where it came from the gummy bears do not eat gummy bears thinking you're going to like get some great grand [ __ ] effect from them they don't hold a whole lot of good nutritional value they don't anything they're pure [ __ ] sugar their [ __ ] will [ __ ] your teeth up after belly up I don't care I like on ah so I hope we can close the case on that situation I mean I think I think [ __ ] flex magazine was like oh like after I started saying this [ __ ] they were like oh like you can eat gummy bears and like post-workout and it's like good cuz it's sugar and this now it's like Jesus Christ no it doesn't know how it works like there's way better things you could be [ __ ] eating post-workout then shitty gummy bears okay maybe drink water I might be a good starter not [ __ ] gummy bears is that it been [ __ ] or better than she [ __ ] protein bars dick after selling oh man gummy bears I just like them Oh what else snacks that's another question snacks what do I personally like because I always talk about snacks [ __ ] love them and what are also good bodybuilder snacks too that you can have in your program that can help add weight and do good for you so start number one me personally I love salty snacks [ __ ] extra salty pretzels Doritos cheez-its get snacks that's my [ __ ] I don't the gummy bear thing the sweet thing that's only pre-workout I just like those but from like the snackin standpoint like it high would've baked and sitting there got a couple beers in me yep yep extra salty pretzels they're in there there's Doritos in there I like nacho cheese the kids like Cool Ranch that's good cheese it's in there too so moving on to snacks that benefit protein that benefit you as a bodybuilder [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly rice cakes those are my go-to I usually have two or three of them before I hit the gym right now my calories are up I eat the Smuckers all-natural creamy I like crunchy but I go through I go through about 16 ounce through our peanut butter in about three days yeah maybe sooner depends on what I'm training calories are crazy high right now I've never eaten this much fat I am right now it's working out well I like it I feel better I think more clear I think more clearly or clearer however you want to term that but yeah peanut butter and jelly rice cakes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the sandwiches in the middle of the night I'll have like I'll have a cup of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if I had big training day I usually do like a large cup of almond milk or I'll mix up a protein shake like one scoop of protein with 8 to 12 ounces of almond milk with my - peanut butter jelly sandwiches yeah snack wise I also so in the truck I also will have trail mix but something so if I'm behind on a meal and I need to keep my calories high or in between meals mean - you know peanuts almonds dried fruit I love that [ __ ] peanut butter bean butter pretzels they're not really greatest for you it's like that's not salty fat guy thing that if you notice there's a lot of peanuts and peanut butter involved with my with my snacking fruit I eat a banana or two a day apples if we got them yeah I do a good bit of fruit too right now my meals are quite large you know a meeting about 40 to 50 grams of protein along with 70 to 100 grams of carbohydrates at each meal five solid meals a day so the snacking is limited and it's like I said it's usually higher calorie snacking as well so that's also why look at the my training sessions need to be [ __ ] intense they need to be optimized they need to be really [ __ ] hard so I sweat I burn those calories I need to eat that type of food if you are not training like that you will get fat from eating all of that [ __ ] for [ __ ] sure other good snacking for dieting that's another question people go out to snack and while dieting the fruit has sugar in it even though it's unprocessed processed on processed sugar natural sugars I it depends on how far you are into a prep some people don't like it I'm still fine with some fruit here and there probably up until like six eight weeks out maybe seven weeks somewhere on there cut it out other people have their own decisions about that I'm talking about everyday snacking uh cucumbers celery greens those are good snack and thins while you're dieting problem is with those is whenever you start adding [ __ ] to it like peanut butter dressings things like that I usually stick to like if I need to I'll add a little bit of salt to it nice and tasty tastes like salt with water and like crunch that's pretty much what it is about peanut butter jelly sandwich but no those those are pretty much my daily snacks that's it yeah I like salty pretzels ice cream unlike that [ __ ] with my belly and lactose-intolerant so I got to be careful with that yep pretty much it locked peanut butter my jelly I think when I go to the store I typically buy like four or five jars at a time but hey what's do yeah no I don't think yo Girt back to us yogurt would be a good snack for people candy you can eat candy too little [ __ ] your [ __ ] all up being sarcastic don't do that late night snacks cereal I do that raisin bran with fruity pebbles in there protein shake is the milk fuckin'-a right that's my [ __ ] take a nice dump in the morning from it all right moving on how much protein should I eat per day oh boy along with this people also get a lot of digestion I get a lot of digestive questions how much protein should be today what depends on how much lean body mass you have right the next thing is is what are you training like how are you training what what are you doing what what physical exertion are you putting out what are you putting out that you need food for how are you training like I said me when I'm going in to Train I'm training like a [ __ ] animal I am going nuts I'm going to put myself through the [ __ ] hardest workout I possibly can for that day and I'm not gonna settle for anything less I'm going to push myself so that I'm gonna push myself further than I thought I could go before whenever I started when I started I'm like I'm gonna [ __ ] work today as I'm doing it I'm searching for ways for that workout to get harder I want to find it so it can be harder so I can challenge myself then I need to eat because the [ __ ] that I just did to challenge myself I was [ __ ] pouring sweat I was shaking I was pushing myself way past what my body actually wanted to do so therefore now I need to refuel my body so that it can grow so that it can rebuild it so that it can recover how much protein do I need to do that see some people be like oh you need 1.5 grams of protein per lean body mass so if you're - if you have 200 pounds of lean body mass you need 300 grams of protein it's a good way to gauge it but if you are working if you are doing the workouts that I've been doing that I do [ __ ] 300 grams ain't enough will it work yes will it suffice yes but in order to grow need more in my opinion you also need a fuckload of carbohydrates because actually meeting right now you're also getting a good bit fast I probably take in per day in protein I probably take in like 350 grams of protein per day that's you know I'm eight weeks in almost nine and a half weeks into my into a program so I'm in the thick of it I got seven and a half weeks left of this program so I'm in the middle of it and I'm [ __ ] working hard my body is burning so therefore that 350 grams of protein probably around for 425 on like cheat days were very very high calorie days my body can utilize all of those and I know that through a couple things one being my digestion I'm not when I'm not pushing out as much gas I'm not gasps I'm not bloated with gas and I'm my elimination schedule is now the same every day so now I am utilizing all of the food that I'm eating okay one thing in the beginning of a program when people start out and they just started training either like in week 1 2 3 and they're eating this food and they are just [ __ ] farting like a fiend they're farting all [ __ ] day long and it smells like [ __ ] bro you are your body it is overload for your body you're [ __ ] it out you're not absorbing it all and you are just gaseous [ __ ] your body doesn't like what's going on so that's why in the beginning you have to start with a little bit lower like I was eatin in the beginning I was even like 275 grams of protein and I was still with my body was becoming acclimated to us part and I was my shed schedule was out of control was also eating a lot of carbohydrates and fats but the protein standpoint with one and a half grams of protein per per pound of lean body mass is a great place to start if you are feeling uncomfortable because that's too much then it's too much you need to back down a little bit maybe 1 1 in a quarter of grams or put two five grams then as you progress into your program you can increase it so the protein thing like I said that's a great place to start that's that's a well-known fact but just also take into consideration all of the other food that you're eating as well my macros for the day broccoli protein 350 grams of protein like I said over for on my on my cheat days with my high calorie days carbohydrates 550 to 750 average per day than on my high calorie days thousand more possibly fats you know probably safe fats roughly yeah 100 to 150 a day pretty pretty pretty religiously every day and I attest that type of eating to the way I'm trained I haven't trained this hard like I happen since years ago years ago and Mikan a lot of 236 pounds when I wake up I'm like 239 when I go to bed and then just keep on training so from a protein standpoint that digestion part pay attention to your digestion digestion absorption elimination if your elimination process is going wrong or your fart a lot and [ __ ] spraying the toilet when you're taking a dump or you're not being absorbed it's just a mess your fart a lot crazy gassy body's having a hard time digesting digesting all of that so back off the protein a little bit like your body become acclimated and as you continue to train harder and harder and the body becomes acclimated and you start working into it all start increasing your food that's how you grow that's how your body has a smooth transition into your your progress your goals it's my opinion [ __ ] do I know next ah here's a good one this is it should I take steroids yes no should I smoke meth sure no that would not be a good idea should I smoke cigarettes if you want to a really good idea that question is a personal [ __ ] choice it's up to you should you do it my opinion no there's pot calling the kettle black however that's saying goes no III don't you though you better have a purpose but I have a purpose you better have researched it and you better have an understanding of what's going to occur if you're asking me should you take steroids what do you know about them have you done research are you educated do you know what the side effects are do you know what can occur do you know if the answer is no then my answer is [ __ ] no if your answer is yes and you can explain to me all those things I just asked all right then now it's personal choice it's up to you you're you're educated you know things are gonna go wrong you know the consequences that you're gonna have to live with possibly for the rest of your life it's all up to you that means that you can't come crying like a little [ __ ] victim that this happened to me because I did this well [ __ ] yeah did would you expect your stupid [ __ ] that's real [ __ ] saying a [ __ ] joke you know these I hear [ __ ] crazy stories from people with the Jemez crazy stories people [ __ ] taking a thousand digs at rent a week that's it thousand makes a trend a week no tests no nothing just the trend are you a [ __ ] [ __ ] yep you are and then after they're done they want to say uh it didn't work out for me I had all these problems no [ __ ] [ __ ] you had problems like most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that what their supplements are supposed to do and then they're also taking a bunch of gear and wondering why the dick doesn't get hard after they stop taking [ __ ] or I don't understand the whole process of testicular atrophy or anything like that holy [ __ ] don't be that goddamn stupid some people are and if you are one of those people I'm gonna highly recommend you change your ways so my next recommendation would be to go watch two steroids drugs and light videos that we put out we put out I think you tell you well five of them thus far the first ones where you should start part one it's really good but overall like I said in those videos it's all personal choice don't do dumb [ __ ] that's like my [ __ ] blanket statement for everything I've done dumb [ __ ] I'll probably continue to do some dumb [ __ ] here and there but make sure that that type of such that type of thing right there should I take steroids take that seriously do your research don't think that you can take steroids for six weeks and everything will be okay and then you'll stop and everything will be okay no [ __ ] these are hormones that you are injecting or putting into your body they are going to affect you everything in this [ __ ] because if I can take something that makes me bigger faster and stronger if I eat train hydrate work harder leave wadd some crazy [ __ ] take it serious don't be a [ __ ] don't be dumb I mean how am i able to sit here and say all this [ __ ] because I did do a lot of dumb [ __ ] he did that's how I learned I'm stubborn bullheaded I'm a risk taker I'll continue to be that and everything that I do in life because that's my personality but I'm recognizing that it's myself and that's how I operate I also am taking full accountability for my decisions in my actions you don't hear me crying nobody so whenever you do these things you're not allowed to cry like a little [ __ ] victim well this happened to me I can't believe I don't want it yeah dude what the [ __ ] do you expect of course that's what's gonna happen [ __ ] off job I hope this was fun I have fun gummy bears snacks protein juice it's all good love it all [ __ ] up but stay tuned for more each of Wiis don't take too much Hannah draw and stick the old lady just like she likes it even some way she doesn't like it she'll like it you", "GAp0OB_ZI6c": "you marijuana is generally a misdemeanor offense however it can be elevated into a felony in a number of ways and one way is when you take the actual substance in marijuana which is THC and that is extracted in some way and used to create something else than that all this sudden becomes a felony offense it's the substance that THC is considered a penalty group to substance which is a felony and we see this most often in cases involving edibles you take gummy bears for example that seem to be popular especially you can buy them in Colorado and other states and a package of gummy bears may actually contain a very small amount of THC but it is a felony offense or even a couple of them so be aware that what is normally a misdemeanor offense that you may think it's not all that serious when it's turned into something else when it's turned into an edible or something else you can consume then you're looking at a felony offense and your misdemeanor marijuana possession all of a sudden becomes a felony that you're in district court for and facing serious criminal consequences", "t_AYgBMBjO4": "nothing kids love more than candies they can pull and stretch which probably explains why gummy candies and licorice have always been stick to your teeth favorites except with parents who don't have a family dental plan everyone calls this red licorice but there is actually no licorice root in it the ingredients are wheat and corn syrup with red food dye and both artificial and natural strawberry flavoring they cook the mixture for two hours at 102 degrees Celsius this slowly forms a thick paste they cool it down then put it through extruders the extruders work like icing nozzles shaping the paste into a design such as the twirls we see here a water lubricated knife slices the continuous strips into 18 and 21 centimeter lengths the water also rinses off any licorice buildup on the blade the cough licorice goes on aluminum trays the stacks of trays then go into an oven to dry for eight hours at sixty degrees Celsius as the excess moisture evaporates the licorice shrivels [Music] workers weigh the correct amount of licorice for each package [Music] to make gummy candies they use what are called printing boards large sheets with raised shapes to make gummy worms for example they mount the gummy worm board on a stamping machine the machine then stamps the worm shapes onto trays of cornstarch this creates a series of cornstarch molds for the gummy worms [Music] while that's going on another machine mixes gelatin sugar corn syrup color and flavoring and cooks the mixture at 115 degrees Celsius a machine called the depositor pours the mixture into the cornstarch worm molds the molds then go into a refrigerated room in 12 to 15 hours the candies cool and solidify [Music] a machine then flips the candies out of the trays the cornstarch molds disintegrate as they fall downward the machine sips out the lumps then recycles the used cornstarch into new cornstarch trays for the next batch [Music] the candies go through a cleaner as they spin air nozzles blast off the cornstarch [Music] the next drum coats the candies with mineral oil to make them shiny children love gummy worms because they're gooey and slippery and wiggly but it's not just kids who are hooked on them many fishermen actually use them for bait [Music] before packaging the candies the workers weed out any that are stretched out or stuck together wonder if they get to eat the rejects [Music]", "0MWFW4tKCVY": "so i just want to thank clumsy cakes for joining me we're doing a collab video i am doing the vegan version of uh gummy bears so for the vegan gelatin we're using sea vegetable agar agar this will act as a gelatin for sweetener i'm using more agave i also have some elderberry i say some blue blue tea thingy thing and this blue tea blender is amazing i'll list her etsy shop down below i have some ginger tea spirulina some pineapple juice and i'm also going to juice off some carrots and then i have my gummy bear mold that just came in from amazon so let's make our cheese and get everything all together all right so we have our carrot juice we have our pineapple juice sugar we have our butterfly um tea we have our green tea which i'm gonna add spirulina soup partially aloe vera tea and i'm just gonna add one tablespoon or one or two tablespoons of blue agave you can add whatever you want and i'm also going to add one in a half teaspoon of your agra agar um you have to heat up your liquid first so i'm just going to measure out a fourth cup of everything heat it up and then we're going to make these into beautiful gorgeous uh gummy bears that are natural colors no additives no food coloring and yeah actually just using my measuring cup two ounces is fourth cup you can also use a scale um but i like using my liquid measuring cup and i'm making a mess which is normal all that good old carrot juice just sitting on the counter so this is two ounces i'm going to heat it up and then i'm going to add the aggregate and i'm going to do this for every single one just doing a quick photo shoot of everything so you guys can see what it looks like this is for my thumbnail and this looks so pretty it's a purple color um but i know if you add an acid so like a lemon juice or lime juice it turns pink so i'm actually gonna do that but yeah guys these are all the ingredients i'm letting the carrot juice actually half of it is on the stove heating up and then we're gonna add agar agar at all and make our beautiful natural gummy bears so after a couple of minutes on the heat i've heated up the carrot juice you can see it change it color and we're just actually going to add this directly to our dropper or gummy bear mold not our dropper using our dropper you just want to make sure most of your um what is it called i got argos dissolve you can see it but this is very good so i'm just i added in one tablespoon of uh which i'm gonna call it what is this called this stuff agave and then i also added in a half a teaspoon of ginger powder because i love the taste of ginger it's also very medicinal so yeah we're just gonna drop it in there so using our dropper we're just gonna go right in there we're gonna fill it up and we're gonna drop it in our mold this does not hold a lot it's so cute and then you're just gonna repeat this until all of them are full i might not even need all this liquid to be completely honest i'm only going to do three rows of this one and then i'm going to fold do the same process with all the other ones and i'll be back to show you guys what the gummy looks like but same exact process heat your liquid up add one and a half teaspoon of agar agar powder a tablespoon to two tablespoons of your sweetener of choice and yeah that's all and then fill it up in your mold the mold and everything will be listed down in the description bar this one i want to see you guys i want to show you guys how to change the color of this because you see what color it is now we're going to do this in slow motion so for the clear gummies i decided to use some of my hibiscus and rose water it's super easy to make and i'm going to use this to make my clear gummies and i'm also going to fill in the rest of them this tastes and smell just like hibiscus and rose it is so flavorful and then i'm also going to use some of the leftover pineapple juice to fill in the extra so yeah i'm super excited to make this into the clear gummies and then i'll show you guys can you see they're so adorable and cute and jelly you can see the jello consistency they're not too sticky actually and they're so cute look at it so i'm going to take them all out and plate them look at them they're so cute and these are the pineapple ones they're so cute okay so these are all the gummies they're kind of sticking together so i'm gonna rub them with cornstarch as she suggests in her video which is linked down below for those looking to make um gummies out of jello some jellos i think are vegan i would have to double check that and i'll let you guys know down in the description bar but these are what mines look like again i'm using these for vitamin purposes if you're using if you're looking to make a more gummy i will put some other substitutes for gelatin down in the description bar below okay we're going to go through the flavors so this first one right here is a pineapple and carrot the one following it is elderberry this one next to it is carrot this one is pineapple this one is butterfly pea flour tea with key lime this one below it is the butterfly pea without key lime this one is my rose water hibiscus water with a little bit of agave this one's spirulina this one's just green tea and this one is elderberry those are all of the flavors that i created and they look so cute so in regards to flavor my favorite two ones are the butterfly pea little phase three um the pineapple and the elderberry i'm gonna try the green tea one now because i didn't try it yet and then i'll let you guys know yeah so these four right here are my favorite the other ones are just from medicinal like medical not medical but for vitamins because you know you need to consume them every day the best place to store these are in the fridge i'm going to dust mines with a little bit of corn starch so they don't stick together in a little bit of sugar but yeah that's how you make vegan gummy bears they're not super gummy but they get the job done you", "oOQlSEMnQs4": "hey Ron today I'm gonna show you guys recipe that I use from vegan gummy bears or any governor lolly as I guess these are great because they are really simple to thank and they avoid gelatin which is obviously ground-up animal hooves they avoid artificial colorings such are quite high quantities and a lot of volleys and they avoid excessive sugars and preservatives as well so they're really awesome thing to be able to do and you can personalize them I would recommend having a mould that has more than one more than one slot I only had an individual coming to be involved which was quite tedious but you can also just pull the mixture into a tray and louts it and then chop them up into little kind of cube lollies as well so I'm using a few different flavorings here which I'll show you guys the basic principle that I'm using is one cup of liquid to four tablespoons of agar agar powder so firstly I'm making a vanilla almond milk flavor and for that I'm using half a cup of almond milk two tablespoons of a baby powder one inch of vanilla pods beans and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia-sweetened and I'm just putting into a pot my half a cup of almond milk and then I'm adding into there my two tablespoons of a bag and just mixing it through thoroughly and I'm squeezing out my inch of Anila pods beans and putting them on the neck I'm adding in two tablespoons of maple syrup to sweeten now mixing that up and putting it over low heat and allowing it to come to a seminar it will simmer for a couple of minutes and then it will start to thicken up nicely so once it's thickened up I'm taking my mold and I'm pouring a small amount in there and you can just put it in the freezer for 30 seconds or less and all sit really quickly and then you can pop out your first gummy beer or first tray of gummy bears hopefully and you can store them in the fridge next I'm going on to make the strawberry flavor that I'm using a quarter of a cup of strawberries a quarter of a cup of water two tablespoons of agar agar and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia like before sauce the same process I'm measuring up the berries with the water and you can strain them through some cloth and I'm just using a cheesecloth or a nut milk cloth to strain the berries through and then I'm adding my two tablespoons of agar agar powder and mixing them through and adding a small amount of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia just sweeten that and then I'm putting it on to low heat allowing it to bubble to and pouring it into my mold setting it and popping them out so next one that I'm doing for this as blueberries and I'm just using a quarter of a cup of blueberries and a quarter of a cup of water 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and some maple swimming pool stevia again and it's just the same process you could strain the berries or just puree them I'm actually leaving some of the pulp and this time it's quite nice like that and then pouring them into my molds once they've simmered with that guide a powder in here in allowing them to suit you so then I'm making a pineapple flavored one and this is using pineapple juice and it's quite an easy thing to do you could use it with any flavor adjustment also making some orange juice flavored ones as well I'm using half a cup of pineapple juice and add 2 tablespoons of agar agar you can also sweeten it a little bit further as well with some stevia if you wanted to and so I'm just mixing that together and then I am simmering it and pouring it into my molds and once I pop them out I had my little pineapple gummy bears and I also have these orange ones so then you've got some finished gummy bears those are flavors that I really like and they're so simple to do and you can continue playing around with all sorts of different flavors I haven't tried it yet but I'm thinking about doing you know like a coffee and almond milk once we milk and also trying different teas as well I thought my golden mango green tea would be really nice with the stevia in it and it would be really healthy as well so various things like that but just basically store them in the airtight container in the fridge for about a week they do sit perfectly fine at room temperature consistency wise but you know they don't have preservatives so you want to make sure that they're fine if you're going to do try this out I would love to your heart grows for you especially if you've got some awesome combinations and I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope people wonderful day guys", "9wv8g-ToF4A": "oh oh my okay if you beat this gummy bear i will pay you one dollar eat this

15 15 15 15. oh so bailey got what 27 which means i need to at least beat 54 dollars in 10 minutes or else you know i'm not doing well i'm trying to double his money all right ryan 10 minutes on the clock here we go eric you ready i'm ready all right three two one stop i love gummy worms right here's your timer those are true and i thought they were gonna be i already understand what bailey went through now no no you don't only have two bucks two he's at four you can slip some other bills in there if you want this is so hard to chew especially when everyone's staring at you this is so hard oh my god [Music] i was going to go for those fries and i saw bailey stroke i was like there's not a chance what's that right now 18 here 18 bucks oh my god i need to break up the flavor you're going for

80. he's at 80. 80 bucks 80 dollars you're getting close to the value of the fries that bailey was going for yeah i got five minutes though that's true yeah four minutes and 30 seconds he might blow he might blow all right he's not looking that one hit me really hard oh my gosh my stomach really hurts yes right that's worth it this is all i've eaten today three minutes ryan oh my that's a lot of time left still tap out you don't have to max out that's true i don't want you to get sick this is really no different than what ryan eats every day that's true how much time do i have you have a minute a minute if he throws up it's over i just really had to fart and i ran out of the room is that what that was you crop dusted me i'm sorry nine eight seven six [Music] all right ryan you had a stack of cash you ready to see how much you're in hopefully it's enough here we go all right 85 90 95 100. 100 510 115 okay 120. 125. would you pay that money right now to not feel the way you do yes how much are you gonna eat well we'll see probably not this much can we go next uh yeah you guys are good to go spin the wheel and let's see what time you get so we're gonna be on the same team so we get to spin the wheel twice and then you guys are teaming up with that you're gonna combine the gummies you eat and combine the scores oh five points oh that was five minutes all right fine five minutes spin it again and we're gonna combine time combine gummies and combine money but the money that gets paid out has to be split between the boat carter it says 15 minutes we can't read because you cheated i know it's going to happen your turn okay so five minutes plus five give me five all right so since you guys are teaming up i'm gonna say that's fair but just know that everything eaten combined between the both of you is gonna get paid out and then split between the both of you all right here we go in three two one go oh my god that is tough if you can finish that in 20 minutes that's 250 dollars and that's a hundred dollars for your cheeseburger stuff has been the banker of the day 100 bucks there's a hundred dollars right here i feel like the bigger the gummies get like the more like like just like just so [Applause] [Music] hang on is it only liz cheating or denise too that's not wine liz that's literally yours it looks like it's your burger look at this i don't think that this is a valid attempt take one bite throw the rest of it in the trash can oh man upon further inspection there's actually nothing in here from denise this is only the burger so denise is still going so whatever denise eats and finishes she'll get paid so she's working on a 250 bottle of coca-cola gummy denise you got this oh no way she's actually doing it are you seeing this okay what none that she has yo eric how much time we got all right denise five and a half minutes left she's almost about to finish that coca-cola bottle which is 250 dollars right here that's 250. wait carter come on two minutes left and denise is actually doing some serious work on this can i talk back in and just try to eat the pizza in two minutes let's help her okay fine two minutes ago can you could fold it because you're not going to finish that there's not much time left doesn't matter if you fold it like new york or not a minute left a minute left a minute denise you gotta put work okay all right come on oh she's got in her mouth look at these trying to finish how does it you're probably all sugared up all right five four three two one all right liz if you can somehow finish that then you're set if you can finish that whatever's in your mouth you are set for a 250 bottle of gummy soda that's insane if you drop any piece it's over just like bailey it's over she dropped the piece you drop oh all right so liz you won a whopping zero dollars because you cheated but denise on the other hand really impressive because you ate an entire one of these and this is a 250 dollar bottle of cola gummy so banker stove let's pay it out 250 dollars make it rain make it rain ready have to divide it into two wait that's true hey that's true that's what we said beginning it is split by two oh carter that puts us in first place and everyone else is a loser well i would say everyone is a winner if they walk away with even one dollar our next contestant is a big eater and he is also the winner of our last eating challenge who can gain the most weight in 45 minutes erica you gained 10 pounds of food in 45 minutes so i think you have a pretty good shot at eating a lot of pounds of gummy all right eric let's spin it and see how much time you get there you go the time will be in your favor for this one since the max is only 15 minutes oh 10 minutes okay all right i feel like you could eat at least one of those five pound gummy bears whoa hi jojo ready starting in three two one go all right and he's off oh wow going to be paying out some cash on this kid i might be losing this whole stack right here oh he just ate the gummy bear's face oh that is a strong gummy bear guys it is the world's biggest oh my god there's no way oh oh my okay guys eric is a beast he can eat some serious food and i think he might even go for the green one next whoa wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where are you wait where's he going what he literally has seven minutes you're giving up oh my god i'm disgusting this is not for me this challenge is disgusting i don't know how you came up with this all right eric you still have six minutes so you could start again on a new gummy bear if you want since you spit that one out or what are you doing this challenge is not worth it after seeing ryan out there on the couch i just don't even think it's gonna be worth the money i'm calling it man i'm calling it that's it all right guys i can't believe it but eric is actually tapping out he's forgoing the thousand dollar gummy bear wait hang on what'd you just eat wait he gets one dollar stone he gets one dollar oh you're still on top two dollars four five six seven dollars all right so i'm calling it wow i'm taking a wrong cash right there all right everyone's a winner so six sixty dollars pathetic you know what i can't i walked away with something and i'm not disgustingly sick so i'll take it as a win here we go guys this is the grand finale we are doing jojo versus stove the way this one is gonna work is they're going to both go at the same time and the person who eats the most is going to steal the other person's winnings and walk away with everything so it's high risk high reward winner takes all you guys ready to spend ready i'll let you go oh five minutes okay so how about he rolled five so multiply that by two so ten minutes give us ten minutes all right you know what all right all right deal here we go ten minutes on timer in three two one start oh he's going for the hot dog hot dog it's a hundred bucks if you can finish it 250 dollars if you can jojo eat like half of that jojo that's a hundred dollar hot dog yeah at this rate he's gonna eat four of those before subjects are ones i mean he might crush the plate of them oh oh he's got it where's the honey hundred bucks for jojo 100 he has to finish it he's gotta finish it but it's right here for you jojo will be officially in first place for this final round and uh remember guys whoever eats the most in this round steals the other person's eatings and earnings so winner takes all no slow mo slow we sell a lot of time left i don't know you just swallowed it the boy has got too much on his plate he's gonna he's gonna make it work i guess technically you could spit it out as long as you still eat it what's wrong with you eyes on the fries i think after this video we're never doing an eating challenge ever again five minutes left eyes on the prize i need some yeezys that's as big as the money you're so close i don't want to throw up after you take your time i mean look you got three and a half years so you can do the mail trip at the end yeah jojo's really clean it up jojo is done that's a hundred bucks ryan payman right here juice that's fine i'll give it to him yeah you get through after think about that jojo you realize if he finishes i know you lose because that's 250. i don't think he is dude that crust is crazy this is so much this that's a long a minute and ten two more dollars just 103. 25 seconds stove just has to get it in his mouth for it to count and then he ultimately has to finish eating it at some point later after the timer am i 110 i haven't seen anyone do that successfully so i think it's a lot harder than it sounds like three four one two three four five six seven eight elbows count you walk away with 250 plus jojo's 100 and change this is really exciting guys this is a very exciting fun round place your bets right now who is going to win we're going to check back in here on stove and see if you can finish you can't go this far just to lose though i mean jojo wants to do it he's actually put in some serious work though oh wait there's one there's a loose piece no i don't know so seriously if that somehow slips and falls it's game over yeah oh oh no oh no what yeah guys no carter there's no way that counts you know he said you said if it touches the ground he loses he said he can't use your hands no hands no hands ugh done all right all right hang on hang on here is the final ruling so the timer ended his stove did not finish his pizza but he did not use his hands and he was able to get it done because he had it all in his mouth and then the timer but he then dropped one little piece which then he ate without using his hands so does that count as a disqualification i'm not sure because also jojo has at least a little tiny piece of equal size of equal size so it's snowdrop so i would say that maybe stone what might end up being the winner but i feel like maybe we should leave it to you guys to vote in the comments down below who should walk away or should jojo keep his winnings and should still keep his winnings i think both of them worked really hard yeah i think they both deserve what they oh yeah i think they're gonna leave jojo and stove because that was a tough round hey guys the bank saw you did a really good job hey hang on hey that's my cash yeah what are you doing guys the bank thought you did great hey here we go ryan give me my money back anyways guys comment down below what you guys would eat and how many of these gummy bears would eat i'll see you guys on the next vlog [Music] piece [Music] you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what

hottest that it has been\nin a long time it is getting me all excited for summertime and all the get\ntogether 's and the parties and so in today's video I'm gonna show you how to\nmake some rummy gummy bears but as a special bonus to go hand in hand with\nrummy gummy bears I'm going to show you how to make some vodka infused gummies\nand they are delicious and they all go together they're perfect for any party\nso let's go spice things up okay so the first thing we're gonna do is get these\nlittle party cups and just put them on a pan or a tray just so it's easier to\nhall off somewhere next we're gonna get our gummies and we have three different\nkinds so of course these are the tropical gummy bears and these are lifesaver\ngummies and the flavor is basically just tangy so after we get these party cups on\nthe pan we are just going to open their little bag up and just start taking the little gummies putting them right in the party cups but\nyou don't want to fill them all the way to the brim and because your gummies\nwill expand and that fills up six I have a few more left but I promised my kids I\nwould save these for them next we are going to put the lifesaver wild berry\ncandy in the party cups and I have to tell you these all smells so good oh my\nword now you can't separate them with colors if you prefer but you really\ndon't need to and this filled up seven because\nremember you don't want to fill it up to the brim and I did have to save a few\nfor my kids so really this would probably fill up eight and this would\nprobably fill up seven for the gummies and these are the small packages but it\ndoesn't really matter and then of course we are doing the sweet tart flavor and\nnow the sweet tart flavor if you can see they kind of have a little bit of sugar\ncoating on them all they smell so good as well and then just put them in your\ncup okay so now we are gonna add our liquor to our gummies and we're gonna\nstart out with our gummy bears and our gummy bears our tropical flavors so we\nare going to do tropical flavor rum okay so you want to make sure the rum is\ncovering the gummy bears completely okay so now we're doing the wild berry\nlifesavers so I chose a blueberry vodka but you can also do the strawberry vodka or the raspberry vodka basically any berry but I chose\nblueberry and so you'll just want to pour the liquor right over the top of\nthe gummies okay so the sweet tart gummies are\nlittle tangy so I chose an orange vodka but really you can choose whatever kind\nyou want okay so now you want to put your gummies in the fridge for at least\n24 hours if you have them in longer it's good because then their bellies get\nfilled with liquor more if you don't want to know what these are these are\nmudslide pudding shots I will link the video below if you want to know how to\nmake your own all right alright guys so it has been about a day\nand a half and if you can see the gummies if you\ncan see most of the liquid is not covering them anymore\ntherefore it has gone into the gummies that is a good indicator that it is done\nand you are ready to party oh man guys can you see these I'm super\nexcited I'm gonna try all three kinds for you so first we are going to try the\nrummy gummy bears and you can just use a toothpick or you can use your fingers it\ndoesn't really matter mmm good okay so the next one we're gonna try is the\nlifesaver wild berry time so good okay now we're going to try the sweet tart\nmMmmm that one's really good but a little tang you I like that one I\nlike a mom they're so good and if you can see\nthere's just a little bit of liquor at the bottom so of course when you are\ndone eating these you can chug the liquor down and they are so good and\nyour friends will love it you will be a hit at any party I hope you guys give\nthese a try and if you have any questions just comment below and if you\nwould like to see more videos please remember to subscribe to this

ingredients some of the stuff I picked up on Amazon these are going to be pre and post amino gummies so if you guys are interested and want to know how I make these keep watching [Music] I'm gonna start by using this glass measuring cup and measure out a half a cup of water I like to use simple truth distilled water with electrolytes but you can use just about any water you want [Music] [Music] so a minute 30 seconds I'm going to heat my water up until it's boiling go ahead and empty all three gelatin packets into a bowl [Music] then you're going to grab your amino acids whether you use optimum nutrition or any other type of amino it's your preference so go ahead and get two scoops and put that into your mixing bowl [Music] so it's nice that you get this little tool it comes with these gummy bear molds when you purchase those so I'm going to go ahead and fill up all the molds with all of the liquid [Music] probably I'll get about one and a half maybe a little more than that of the molds filled [Music] and then I'm going to go ahead and I want to place those into the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes [Music] when I check and make sure that they're ready and they're not still liquidy [Music] and here is what they look like super easy to pop these all out of the mold only takes a couple seconds and here are all the amino gummies [Music] so there you have it that's the recipe for a super easy amino gummy hmm so I'm going to go ahead take my little bag of gummies and head over to the gym for a quick little back and shoulder exercise anyway thanks for watching you

a small amount i think it is [ __ ] how many are you the people who are sleeping on 10 give me a number what's the number to beat because if you're gonna say eat 500 of them i'm gonna say yeah i could

weird oh no look at the timer i'm feeling the way i would describe the way i'm feeling right now is i would not go out if i was invited somewhere at this point i feel a storm coming all that matters right now is that clock keeps ticking there is a warning on the package that reads consumption of sugar-free candies may cause stomach discomfort and or laxative effect individual tolerance will vary if this is the first time you've tried these candies we recommend beginning with one fourth of a serving size or less this guy's making me confident that i have nothing to worry about so i'm gonna eat three more just to make it just to make it an even 30. there's nothing honestly if this guy can eat a whole bag well maybe even 30. i shouldn't have done that all right let's see let's maybe your guys's media share will make me laugh right as you can tell by the video this video is all about poo and how to hold in your poo when they didn't even get to it okay i'm i'm gonna give you guys an

standby on the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you", "1PTvRxfVKKE": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric

"5RIx22M0Lnk": "hi everyone i'm gino and welcome to my channel today i am super excited to show you guys a very simple champagne gummy bear recipe we're able to take just a few ingredients and transform it into something extra elegance if you are new to the channel welcome to my channel and if you'd like to show some support feel free to hit the subscribe and a notification belt so you can be reminded of whenever I post a new baking or cooking video without further ado let's get into these ingredients for this recipe you will need a gummy bear mold some champagne of your choice a quarter of a cup of water 3 tablespoons or three envelopes of gelatin and some gold edible accent parts you first want to start by putting your gelatin into your cup of water make sure that you are using unflavored gelatin so we're not giving it any extra flavor and also one helpful tip that I didn't know before is that each packet of gelatin is equivalent to one tablespoon so since we're needing three tablespoons we're gonna add the three then you just want to take a fork and just mix it around a little bit we are going to let the water and a gelatin bloom for five minutes and what that means is that the water will absorb all of the gelatin and get it ready to do its job next we are going to measure out one cup of our champagne now you want to take your one cup and pour it into a pot and we're just gonna let it come to a simmer which should take a couple of minutes all right so our champion has come up to a simmer so now it is time to add in our gelatin you'll know that your gelatin is blue when it looks like applesauce just like this so just add it into your pots and we're gonna whisk it in and make sure that the gelatin is well incorporated into the champagne at this point we want to pour the gelatin mixture into our measuring cup again and we're just gonna let this cool for a few minutes to come to room temperature so our gelatin mixture has cooled on for a little bit we are going to add some of our edible gold hearts into our gummy bear mold I got this one at jo-ann fabrics but I know Michaels has some Walmart Target I've seen them just about any big retailer I got hearts like all over the countertop but it's okay okay one useful tip before you start filling your gummy bears is to place your gummy bear mold on a pan so that you're not moving and shaking around when you're taking this to the fridge so now I'm using a pipit or a dropper this one actually came with the set that I bought it's a lot easier to pour your quit into your mold using this it's a lot more precise so you just want to fill them up all the way you can leave a little bit of space if you'd like alright so once your gummies are all filled up you want to place these in the fridge for a half an hour or until they're nice and set in addition to this I have two non alcoholic gummy recipes on my channel I have a Lego gummy candy recipe that super fun to make with children and I also have a grape and fruit punch W recipe that's thick healthy as well so it's been about half an hour our gummies are nice and settled so now it is time for us to take them out of the mold I like using these silicone molds just cuz it's easy to get them out if you want to first stretch it to help release the Bears from the mold and then you just want to sort of push it up and pull it up and look at how adorable these things are you can see the little hearts everywhere as always thank you guys for joining me once again on frosting part I hope that you guys truly enjoyed this recipe and that you guys give it a try you can do so much with these gummy bears you can give it to friends have it as something to enjoy an New Year's party whatever the day may be these gummy bears

need three tablespoons of agar agar powder I'm only showing you two tablespoons right now but that's because I decided to add an extra tablespoon towards the end you're also gonna need half a cup of frozen blueberries that you're gonna put in the microwave until you can mush them and you're gonna use a quarter of a cup of water a vegan recipe would totally suck if there wouldn't be maple syrup in it so you're also gonna add two tablespoons of maple syrup and of course stevia so you're gonna mush the blueberries and throw them in a pot which you're gonna put on medium heat adding the maple syrup the agar agar powder and whisking it adding the stevia and here I decided my mixture wasn't thick enough so I added a third spoon of agar agar powder then you're gonna put the mixture in these

bears in the bag and let's take them out and try them okay so i think i have one of each color here that's in the bag looks like the ones on the front and on the back side it says they are cherry strawberry mango pineapple lemon orange green apple watermelon pink grapefruit lime blue raspberry and grape so let's see i had to take a guess this one probably cherry yep um that was good strawberry strawberry is very good not too sure which one would be mango i'm gonna guess it's gonna be one of these yellow ones nope that was a lemon that one was mango this one should be pineapple yes one of my favorites i had the lemon already so orange lemon and orange are my least favorite so far green apple that was pretty good watermelon i think that was watermelon [Music] no that was pink pink grapefruit that was pink grapefruit definitely pink grapefruit lime nope green apple that's one is watermelon you like green definitely blue raspberry and grape so my favorites were strawberry mango pineapple pink grapefruit and watermelon my least favorites were cherry straw i mean cherry lemon lime orange and grape the plain flavors but these gummy bears were so soft they're so soft some of the gummy bears like this is the pink grapefruit some of the gummy bears like the haribo they're sometimes they're too hard and chewy these are super gummy so is this world's best they might just be up for that [Applause] [Music] gummy bears this is a watermelon these are really good gummy bears if you have them in your store pick some up you won't regret it if you like gummy bears thanks for watching i better not eat too many of these even though they're fat free gluten free and low sodium they're still got sugar in them right so catch you on the next one peace", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

thank you thank you much special cheese and thank you my new subscribers thank you thank you just scared girl love you", "-xix6u2w-uc": "guys do i look like wendy from peter pan right now this bow is giving me peter pan wendy vibes i always wanted to be wendy hi everybody welcome back to my channel if you are new welcome my name is cooper new and today we're making another fun little treat in the kitchen we're making champagne gummy bears let's go i'm so excited i'm gonna set these down i made gummy bears once before on my channel it was weird anyway all of my friends and family know my two favorite things on earth are gummy bears and champagne that's it that's all i need so let's combine them there's a candy brand called sugarfina they have champagne gummy bears they're amazing so i'm going to try to make it myself so yeah if you want to see how to make champagne gummy bears it's supposed to be super easy then just keep watching [Music] so for this you actually don't need very many things you just need champagne you need sugar and you need gelatin oh and also gummy bear molds hello duh for right now i have one cup of the root rose is reducing over medium heat once this has kind of reduced down a little bit we'll add another cup and a half and now i'm going to do just a regular champagne i figured it would be fun to try both again i'm absolutely terrified of doing this part oh my god am i doing it i'm doing it oh wow i'm a beast nice i took off the last one with a cork opener i know that's super not how you're supposed to do that but i did it so one cup yes i feel like i should pour myself a glass while i'm making this what do you guys think it is time for some champagne i love to drink champagne everything's looking good these guys are bubbling i'm enjoying my day how's everyone doing are we all doing well okay so let me tell you guys a little bit about the gelatin we're using today agar agar what i'll name my firstborn it is a vegetable gelatin substitute the difference here this is plant-based it's made from red algae without any artificial chemical ingredient regular gelatin is made from skin bones tendons and cartilage of livestock animals yuck that's kind of gross this has fibers calcium iron vitamins so yeah this should be interesting i'm excited to try this this one looks like it's reduced so i'm going to go ahead and add a cup and a half more so the rose one is doing a nice job here so we are going to go ahead and add the gelatin and also the sugar so for the gelatin you're doing one fourth of a cup okay and now let's also add while that's doing that let's add a cup of sugar there we go so we are going to continue to whisk this until everything dissolves and until it really thickens up so now i'm going to do the exact same thing over here for our regular champagne gummies fourth a cup of the gelatin pour that in got it all over me and also a cup of sugar now i'm just gonna go back and forth kind of whisking these guys until they look ready to me i guess take our lovely reduced mixture here this is the rose one and i have out our gummy bear molds and i'm going to use a dropper now this might take an eternity uh to do a dropper and do this but i'm willing okay so let's begin so what's interesting about agar agar is that am i saying that right agar agar whatever is that the freezing point of it you know when the molds get hard is just room temperature so these are already ready to go so that's pretty cool that you can make these so fast i'm telling you these are already ready oops look he's already ready to eat i'm going to eat him interesting but delicious i'm gonna keep making some more i'll be back okay guys here they are uh these are the champagne ones these are the rose ones aren't they kind of cool nice so i just want to show you what they look like if you decide you want to coat them in sugar it gives them obviously a little extra sweetness but they're still just as cute look at that guy these also have a little bit more of a melt in your mouth kind of more of a jello texture than a traditional gummy bear these turned out really well i'm actually really impressed with how quickly the agar agar solidifies just at room temperature it's super fast and yeah these are really good it says that these are best kept in the refrigerator i like the regular champagne ones a lot more than rose ones i wonder if i could toss them and eat them in the sky i'll get it oh close that was way off i don't know what that was nope nope that was just straight up and down that was way behind my head nice i did it that is it for this video thank you so much for watching and i will go ahead and see you guys again in my next one bye", "x8UW3AYy9VY": "hi guys it's annie let's eat today we have our little woo halloween candies yay this year we didn't do any trick-or-treating because of covid and i bought a little bit of the halloween candy that we would normally you know get from trick-or-treating is eaties here except for the blood and brain i know this is very interesting i've never seen this before this here is syrup i think it's syrup i hope it's syrup i mean they wouldn't sell it it was not edible right so this is supposed to be a bag of kind of like oh it's leaking yeah because i did it yeah you did do you want to try this one for summer it's kind of cool look how cool it is i've never had this before never know and then we got some brain over here gummy brains we have sticky sticky syrup and we have some marshmallows of course then we have eyeballs some eyeballs and we have these little whirly things these are just add-ons really because they're so good yeah i love the rainbow um sour patch we have some cute little burger gummies here they actually feel really good when you like do this yeah they're quite soft and it actually says fries i'm excited for these because these smell and look really good and we have oh henry i always ask the kids to get me an old henry bar every time they go trick-or-treating yeah and that's what they ask for actually right yes and kitkat i love kitkat yeah that's the one thing that i left out so yes well we don't have kitkat we don't have kitkat it's okay we got these so okay which one are you gonna start with emma i feel like i'm gonna start with the oh henry where's my oh henry oh it's right here because it's gonna melt oh yeah you're right the chocolate is melting cheers if we went trick-or-treating this year emma what would you be a school person what do you mean a school person i got a teacher no a school person like a student i would guess that you would want to be mulan because you were obsessed with mulan for a couple months when the movie came out and you liked that character since last year then i moved on to stitch there isn't a costume for stitch though i can make it a mangas character or monkeys i'm not familiar with the language it's a game i know it's a game i've seen you play it a couple of times is it just like hide and seek no how do you play that game so it's like um there's like either like two or one imposters and uh you can dress up when you're waiting for like more people to join because you have like these like a maximum like it's either 10 or like maybe four people so and then i always joined like almost like nine players to 10 so and then i joined and then um so we have to figure out who's the imposter so if if the impostor kills someone and you turn into a ghost and you try to have to do all the tasks to win tasks i mean and find the imposter yeah and the other p people have to report the body and the imposters can vent like go through um like vents and then um um the crewmates can like uh pool mates yeah crewmates they can press an emergency button and they can report the body and find out who is the imposter and then they just go floating around when they they so does the imposter like try to take you out like try to kill you in the game uh um or do you just have to figure out who it is yeah you have to figure out like the crewmates like one imposter if and impossible because you're really good if the imposter kills you you turn into a ghost and you have to finish all tasks to win if you're a see you ghost and you can't um like help anyone and you can text in the game but if you're a ghost you cannot text no one can see you yeah it's like serious like in two if there's two girls a ghost and there's one more ghost so three ghosts you can talk to the two other goats ghosts because they're ghosts you lost me at ghost your mind you should try these gummies these are supposed to be zombie gummies you know actually quite tasty and they're not too sweet so which is good oh man oh good i think i'm gonna try the brain here the brain it was a little sour when i had a little taste oh let's see you can handle it right here okay let's try do you think i'll like it ready no because you said it so trying to handle it looks good it's really good emma i'm i'm not lying it's like sweet and sour but but leaning towards sweet and it's gummy which is good i'm having this i haven't tried it yet i was drinking water it's kind of gooey this is like making

that here how about i'm still chewing hurry up how can i help you handle my small mouth this is really good i'm surprised i really want to try sticky though i really want to try these so these are kind of like rope candies no rainbow they're a little salty and sour i can make sushi i do miss the sushi candy video though oh yeah i got the zombie candy in here so you can turn them into like a little swirl do you miss trick-or-treating emma yeah yeah but it's weird how you have to go to people's houses and you have to walk it's fun i remember can't you just go to a drive-through like drive through trick-or-treating yeah that would be a really good idea but go to the carnival like and they have like these machines yeah where they just um like put get a bucket scoop some and then put it

Narrator:\nGUMMY VITAMINS WERE INVENTED\nIN THE LATE THE 20th CENTURY BY A COUPLE\nLOOKING FOR A WAY TO ENTICE THEIR DAUGHTER\nTO TAKE HER VITAMINS. INFUSED INTO A GUMMY CANDY, VITAMINS ARE NOW A SWEET\nAND CHEWY EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH KIDS AND ADULTS. \u266a\u266a JUST LIKE GUMMY CANDIES, GUMMY VITAMINS COME IN A VARIETY\nOF SWEET, FRUITY FLAVORS, MAKING A VITAMIN\nA LESS BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW. EACH GUMMY VITAMIN STARTS\nWITH A SPECIFIC FORMULA. FIRST, RAW INGREDIENTS ARE\nSELECTED AND WEIGHED. SOME ARE IN LIQUID FORM\nAND OTHERS ARE SOLIDS. THE NUTRITIONAL INGREDIENTS\nARE BLENDED WITH WATER. THIS PARTICULAR BATCH IS\nA MULTIVITAMIN PREPARATION. IT INCLUDES MAGNESIUM,\nCALCIUM, AND OTHER MINERALS. \u266a\u266a IN A SEPARATE TANK, TECHNICIANS\nPREPARE THE GELATIN BASE WHICH GIVES THE VITAMINS\nA JELLY-LIKE CONSISTENCY. NEXT, SUGAR AND GELATIN PRE-MIX\nIS POURED INTO THE TANK. \u266a\u266a THE TECHNICIAN\nADDS A SUGAR SUBSTITUTE TO THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. MEANWHILE, SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF\nWATER AND GLUCOSE ARE DISPENSED INTO THE TANK. \u266a\u266a IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO BLEND THE INGREDIENTS\nFOR THE GELATIN BASE. THEN, THE GUMMY VITAMIN BASE IS TRANSFERRED TO\nA LARGE HOLDING TANK. IN THE LAB, THE NUTRITIONAL\nMIXTURE IS TESTED FOR CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS\nHEAVY METALS AND BACTERIA. AN AUTOMATED SYRINGE INJECTS\nTHE SOLUTIONS INTO TEST TUBES, RINSING IN BETWEEN INJECTIONS. NOW THE SAMPLES IN THE TEST\nTUBES ARE READY TO BE ANALYZED. FOR HEAVY METAL TESTING, THE SAMPLE IS INJECTED INTO AN\nEXTREMELY HOT VACUUM CHAMBER. THE PLASMA FLAME TURNS THE METAL\nCONTAMINANTS INTO ATOMS, WHICH THE MACHINE\nREADS AS DIFFERENT COLORS. THE MACHINE ALSO IDENTIFIES\nAND QUANTIFIES CONTAMINANTS. WITH THE SAMPLES\nCLEARED FOR PROCESSING, THEY'RE READY\nFOR FLAVORING AND COLORANT. MORE VITAMINS ARE ADDED\nIN POWDER FORM TO BOOST THE FORMULA'S POTENCY. THE LIQUID VITAMIN PREPARATION\nAND THE GELATIN BASE IS PIPED INTO THE MIXING TANK. THEN, EVERYTHING\nIS BLENDED TOGETHER. THE BATTER IS NOW READY\nTO BE MADE INTO THOUSANDS OF GUMMY\nVITAMINS. A CONVEYOR QUEUES UP\nTHE VITAMIN MOLDS. MULTIPLE NOZZLES DEPOSIT\nPRECISE AMOUNTS OF BATTER INTO SMALL MOLDS. THE CONVEYOR MOVES\nTHE TRAY FORWARD AS THE GUMMY VITAMINS\nBEGIN TO SOLIDIFY. A ROBOTIC ARM STACKS THE MOLD\nTRAYS IN A HOLDING AREA. THE ARM GENTLY LOWERS\nTHE TRAYS INTO PLACE. FOR SEVERAL HOURS, THE PILLS CONTINUE TO\nHARDEN IN THE MOLDS. ONCE COMPLETELY SOLIDIFIED, THE GUMMY VITAMINS\nARE REMOVED FROM THE MOLDS AND TRANSFERRED\nINTO A REVOLVING DRUM. THE TUMBLE IN\nTHE DRUM SEPARATES THEM. THEY EXIT ONTO\nA PERFORATED CONVEYOR, AND ANY SMALL BITS\nFALL THROUGH THE HOLES. THE CONVEYOR ZIGZAGS\nBACK AND FORTH, ALLOWING THE GUMMY VITAMINS\nTO COOL AND FURTHER SOLIDIFY. THE GUMMY VITAMINS HAVE NOW\nREACHED THEIR FINAL CONSISTENCY. THE GUMMY VITAMINS HEAD INTO\nA STEAM CHAMBER. THE HUMIDITY FROM THE STEAM PREPS THE VITAMINS\nFOR SUGARCOATING. THE SUGAR CLINGS TO\nTHE GUMMY VITAMINS. AND THE REVOLVING ACTION OF\nTHE DRUM SHAKES OFF ANY EXCESS, LEAVING JUST A DUSTING\nON THE SURFACE. AT THE PACKAGING STATION,\nTHE VITAMINS FUNNEL INTO CHUTES WHERE SENSORS COUNT AND RELEASE\nTHE PILLS INTO BOTTLES. AS THE BOTTLES MOVE FORWARD,\nCAPS LAND ON THE RIMS. AND SPINNING RUBBER MECHANISMS\nSCREW THE CAPS ON TIGHTLY. DOWN THE LINE,\nLABELS WITH PRODUCT INFORMATION ARE PLACED ONTO EACH BOTTLE. DEPENDING ON THE FORMULATION,\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO THREE WEEKS TO PRODUCE GUMMY VITAMIN PILLS. AND THE RESULT? NUTRITIOUS GUMDROPS\nTHAT ARE A REAL TREAT.", "nzz5J9B1GC8": "hey hey hey good-looking I'm so glad that you came to my kitchen today just sit there and see what we all have cooking well grab ahold and I swing right back to my kitchen and let's get cookin good-lookin today we're gonna take a walk on the wild side and work at a center make our salsa some CBD gummy bears so be sure to follow me and let's get cookin good-lookin did someone say CBD coming bears uh-huh well I sure did follow me and I'm gonna show you just how it's done let's get started good-looking so what you're gonna be needing for your CBD gummy bears is a half a cup of water now I have a half a cup of water here I have myself a container right here and I'm just gonna sit there and dump my half cup of water into my container now let's go on with the rest of the ingredients you're gonna need 1 tablespoon of the Knox gelatin so let's go ahead I'm gonna open this up always always always measure out okay it's not quite a tablespoon so we're gonna have to sit there and get another packet and so I had take that tablespoon of the NOx gelatin and we're gonna sit there and let it soften and bloom for at least a minute or so okay the NOx gelatin has softened and now let's go on with the recipe now you're gonna have to choose a flavor that you're gonna want to make your gummy bears to be but it's gonna have to be some type of a jello you know whatever it you could even make homemade jell of kool-aid packages whatever flavor you want is a flavor that you know we're gonna make we're gonna need 1/3 ounce package of any flavor so I'm choosing to use the tropical fusion this is what yours is gonna look like after we put the jello in and we mix it all up now I'm handing it off to chef Mike and he's just gonna sit there and warm all this up and we'll take it from there but basically you're gonna want everything to be dissolved chef Mike just handed it back off to me and he cooked it for about one minute halfway through we stirred it and now I'm stirring it all again now we need to sit there and let this cool down a little bit you do not want to sit there and add your CBD oil when it is too hot so I always sit there and let this cool down a little bit and then we're gonna sit there and put the CBD oil in it now talking about the CBD oil now they recommend that you sit there and you start out with a low dosage and if you need to have more youth that's when you start working your way up to the higher dosages so this recipe calls for 300 milligrams of CBD oil and also talking about the CBD oil always buy it from somebody that knows what they're doing now I go to registered pharmacist and I bought my CBD oil from him so with that all being said I just wanted to sit there put my little two cents in about the CBD oils I buy mine from a pharmacist all right I brought out my little digital thermometer and I'm just gonna sit there I want to make sure if we're gonna be getting this I want to sit there and see what the temperature of the jello mix is so let's go ahead I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna point it right on in there and it's telling me it's at 111 112 degrees so I'm gonna sit there and add our CBD oil right now to it so I'm gonna measure it out okay and now let's go ahead put it in now you're gonna want to sit there and mix this up really good and keep mixing when you think you mixed it up good enough keep mixing okay I'm quite confident I mix that all up now let's go ahead and talk about what mold you're gonna be using I know I said we're gonna be using the gummy bears so I have a gummy bear mold here and I have it set on the cookie tray that way I can sit there and easily transport these and you can sit there get other ones you know you can get ones for holidays whatnot as long as you have some candy molds basically it's what you need now next thing is you're gonna need some cooking spray now you're gonna want to spray each one of these candy molds all up now when I'm spraying my candy molds I like taking all my things over by my kitchen sink and going like this and spraying because you're always cleaning your sink anyways when you're doing dishes so let's go ahead and I'm gonna go over by my sink and I'm gonna get my candy molds a good spritz okay now that I sprayed my molds all up I'm gonna sit there and grab the gummy bear mixture here I'm gonna give it a final stir before I do place it inside they cut me bear molds gummy bears are on their way baby now I'm gonna go ahead fill my molds up you don't have to thumb up all the way all the cameras right before me - I don't so I'm gonna continue to do this off camera because the cameras really not being useful it's in my way right now so I'm gonna fill up my little gummy bear molds here and we'll be right there okay I have my molds filled up with the tropical fusion gummy bears now I'm gonna make up another package and I'm gonna continue to fill up the rest of my tray here as you see I finished up filling up my gummy bear molds that on your countertop for 30 minutes these sat on the corner for the 30 minutes now I'm gonna sit there and transfer them over to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes and I know I'm gonna get asked why was there more of the purple than the tropical fusion well that's because I used this I buy this old for from the Amish and it was the black cherry gelatin from them and it tells you to use 1/3 cup so I used what my recipe here calls for now that's the one reason why I had more than what I had when I used the tropical fusion okay I brought these out of the refrigerator now time to pop them right out of their molds I'm gonna just remove these and put them off to the side so I can show you what we're going to do so okay I removed one of the gummies go ahead I want you to make all your gummy bears stand to attention just like that so I'm gonna continue I'm molding all my gummy bears and making them all stand to attention just as they are right here and there you go folks that's how easy it is oh I see we got a roll one going again now we're just gonna sit there and leave these that sometimes they don't want to cooperate with you okay fine they don't stay in these on end the ones that aren't standing which I like to call the bad news bears but all the other ones that are standing attention we're gonna sit there and I allow them to sit like this for two days now this is gonna sit there and let them toughen up and dehydrate a little bit more and become more of them little Hasbro gummy bears that y'all no one loves so much but there's one further step that we have to sit there but they're one another one that we have to sit there and take this one more step further after this stage so like this for two days come on load guy you guys get with the program now stand up student you I'll see you in two days two days have gone by now what you're gonna want to do to the ones that are standing up is let me sit there and zoom down a little bit such as this one here you're gonna want to sit there and take it and just lay that little guy down like I have all these other gummy bears now we're gonna let them sit like this for one more day then they should be like them Hasbro gold gummy bears that we all love and behold so dear to us these should be just like them they should be you know that that should have that tackiness that the Hasbro gummy bears have you know I mean they're perfectly fine if you want to sit there and eat them this way go for it you can but if you want it to be more like the Hasbro gold gummy bears you're gonna want to sit there and do this extra step now folks I just want to sit there and put out a kindly reminder please keep these up out of reach of young little

want to introduce you guys to our uh brand new product which are delta eight um 50 milligrams per gummy uh edibles these are some delta eight gummies that we just brought out um they're assorted fruit flavors right now you can get a in a thousand milligrams so 20 in a pack or if you've never tried um delta 8 and you want to try it but you don't want to buy a whole bunch this is a nice little 250 milligram sample pack you get five gummies in there um so far all of our feedback on the gummies has been pretty positive uh flavor-wise they taste almost like candy um and just to give you an idea i went here into our little company stash so you can kind of see the size of them and they're uh definitely got some sugar on them and uh they're they're really fairly tasty for a delta eight gummy you'll find a lot of them are a little bit bitter um these don't tend to be they're made from a really high grade delta 8 distillate that's infused into them if you're new to gummies be careful because edibles tend to be a little bit uh different than smoking so if you take a gummy it can take a good 30 minutes on the low side to 90 minutes on the high side until you get the full effects uh just so be aware of that so you don't overload and take too much so and the other thing with your uh delta eight products is if you're experienced with edibles from a marijuana perspective basically uh the the delta eight is like half the potency so you know if you're used to taking a 10 milligram uh thc9 gummy then you need a 20 of these and so on so you know you're used to taking 20 milligrams and you need 40 milligrams so we came up with these 50s they're they're potent they're they're strong um but you can easily just cut one in half and uh and get half the dosage all right if you have any questions um any comments um we're always here to help as well as listen to your feedback uh get in touch with us at the website and we'll talk to you soon you", "ytiBnGozyhg": "[Music] hi guys it's Casey and welcome back to my channel smarts means when these two type of gummy bear with less sugar and more fiber essentially a different macronutrient breakdown than regular gummy bears economy wondering if even hack don't make you money their recipe and make healthier versions after some recipe research and testing I put together this recipe for homemade gummy bears that you can make in a variety of flavors juice beet gelatin I'm using a vital protein and your choice of sweetener I decided to use powders the others recipe all trays then feed this up over the stove and stir it together until the stevia is fully dissolved once I've done that I'll be bringing this combination to a boil and then adding in the gelatin and whisking it together until the gelatin dissolve very quickly to the orange juice still warm I'm going to use an eyedropper to place a little bit of orange juice into my silicone gummy bear jerky so once you've used your eyedropper to fill up your entire gummy bear tray pop this into the fridge for about 20 minutes and once your gummy bears have set just pop them out of the tray and enjoy you have your healthy homemade governor that's all I have for you guys today I hope you enjoyed this tutorial be sure to subscribe to my channel and like this video you have to make these gummies tag me on instagram at devious baking I'll see you guys [Music] you you", "-x9L85UzUQI": "hi guys Melissa here with keeping it keto lazy style so today is Halloween so happy Halloween I know y'all won't be seeing this on actual Halloween but just know I wish do one if you're into that kind of thing if not happy Thursday it's Thursday so for this Halloween occasion I decided I want to try to make my own gummy bears gummy bears are my favorite candy so for my birthday if you follow me on Instagram you know is my birthday this past Tuesday the 29th and my sister gave me something I really wanted which is these gummy bear molds yeah if you want these I had them on my wish list from Amazon they're so affordable like seven dollars and some change and they're prime so free shipping if you have that so I'm gonna make two different kinds and I've never done this before since I just got these so this is gonna be a little experiment but I'm sure it's going to be good I'm gonna be making one with fruit tea and another one with a box of jell-o just to see which one I like better so stay tuned and let's get started [Music] so I'm going to start off with the fruit t1 and what I used is the Tazo passion T of what cereal opens oh no okay that's a fail one just fell out ignore that is the Tazo passion t it's actually the same one that Starbucks uses for their passion fruit tea so it is really delicious and I have one cup of water that I got to a rolling boil and then I put in two tea bags because it said that it is best when it's really strong so I just did two of those and they've been steeping for about 10 minutes so I'm just gonna take out the tea bags let's do this throw them in the trash I need two tablespoons of gelatin so gonna open this up let's see I was trying to read on the box to see if it told me how much is in here oops okay so one pack is about one tablespoon so I'll get to pad and then sweetener of choice I'm gonna do swerve it says let's see here we go 1 tablespoon of sweetener and then I'm gonna use these stevia drops just for a little extra 3 4 5 5 drops now let's stir [Music] so you want to stir until it is all incorporated and it is still pretty hot so just be cautious with that okay we're getting there it's getting nice and thick I have stirred it it is all incorporated there's no more chunks of the gelatin so next step is giving it a taste so let's give this little taste I'm gonna say it needs a little bit more sweetener it's not even that sweet so I'm gonna add about 1/2 a tbsp of the swerve I'm just dumping it in there I'm gonna stir it together and then give it another taste stir it in let me give it a little taste better okay that's doable so let's start molding these so I'm gonna get a dropper I'm gonna start off with the blue ones so and I did wash these just now before I did it so put this in here squeeze it and then suck up some juice there we go look at that and I'm gonna come over here ooh and I'm going to just start filling the molds [Music] all right so the blue trays are filled and I still have about a half a cup of mix but I also want to do the jello ones so I'm gonna just set this to the side for now and see how much I have left now I put these on a little tray so whenever I put them in the fridge it's easy because look these are silicone so imagine carrying a filled silicone tray and it's just gonna spill everywhere so I put it on a little tray my weights easy to transport to the fridge so now I have a half a cup of water I'm going to boil and then add lime sugar-free jell-o to it the water just came out of the microwave and again I'm using lime sugar-free jell-o so I have the pack right here and this is let's see point four four ounces 12.5 grams don't know if y'all can see it but it's right there that's the size that I'm using so let's guess pour some in here I don't know how much I did like half of it so let me stir it now that it's all incorporated I'm gonna give it a taste cuz what I read they said like you know the sugar-free jell-o is already sweetened mmm that's so good I should have done more of this than the T one but it's okay so let me get my other dropper the clean one and start filling up the purple side okay wonderful careful with that just squirt out I guess [Music] so for future reference a half the cup is perfect for two so I'm gonna have to do something with this one maybe I'll pour it into my ice cube trays and have like little ice cube shaped ones but I'll see so now these go into the fridge for about 30 minutes until they show up now when I'm a little confused about is the green ones I know it has gelatin in there but how is it not gonna be little gummy bear jell-o's you know what I mean OOP this one needs some like is it gonna be Wiggly like jello or cuz we only used a little bit I don't know but either way if I have to have a bowl full of gummy bear shaped jello I'll still eat it not a problem so in to the fridge these little guys go thirty minutes has passed and they seem hard oh it's so nervous and these hey they feel pretty good too so let's see what we have to work with so I have just a little Rubbermaid bowl I'm going to put these in that way I can stick them back in the fridge and store them in the fridge so I guess I'm just really stalling because I'm so nervous so let me take you down so these are the fruit tea one so the passion tea so okay so far so good let's oh my gosh it's working look I did it a cute little bear they're so tiny okay success so I'm gonna just dump these over and then just start popping all of them out oh this one's stuck a little bit that's okay they're not perfect I want jarred to make sure he knows these are homemade and I don't think there's a way you can't tell cuz they're a little you know different so let's just keep doing this [Music] I'm still struggling I'm on the second one but this is a real pain in the butt they are sticking they are breaking I don't know if they need a set up some more is 30 minutes not another time is it just because of the way the silicones are I really don't know but this is going to be tortured to clean up look at it a headless bird you know if you can see that but it's headless it is definitely headless I don't even know if I'm gonna keep trying if they break I'm just gonna leave them in there because it is just I think this is gonna be my Pinterest fell for sure but there's still hope for the yellow one oh look there's some came out perfect let's see you opens I don't came out perfect yay see you give up say you're gonna give up and then they start coming out all these are coming out good now oh not that one this is what we got with the passion tea ones likely it's Halloween so I could totally play off the headless bears and all that they basically are like jello they're not hard like a gummy bear so just keep that in mind if you're thinking like me it's gonna be like a traditional gummy bear it's more just like jiggly jello but that's okay let's look at these these are the lime ones please Hey route 1 came out pretty good let's hope the rest are like that nope [Music] you know what I'm going to let these set for a little bit longer because they're not wanting to come out either so let's wait about another 20 minutes to do these wow those are waiting for another 20 minutes let's try what I was able to get out so I have the passion fruit one right here Oh hate it I'm just being honest it's not good it has such a fake taste to it I add so much sweetener Oh mm-hmm please let these little green ones be better this is a total fail all right those are good tastes like jello and they're a little more jiggly look oh yeah [Music] the green ones are a little bit better but honestly I think I'm just gonna stick to the gummy bears the sugarfree gummy bears I get at the store and eat them in moderation because you know they have that sweetener that's not really good for you and it really disrupts the belly if you know what I'm saying and you know what I'm willing to deal with that to never have to try these again so oh I'll watch I'll know if the extra 20 minutes worked or not but for now I'm just ending this video here because this was a Pinterest fail so keep in mind that this was just an experiment try it at your own risk let me know any tips or tricks that you know and how I could have done better because I'm always willing to give it another shot so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see y'all next time [Music]", "PONb1cRKXsw": "this is my first time making gummy bears and I got this awesome green gummy bear mode that came with this little pipette so you can transfer liquids easier into the mode it makes about 100 gummy bears I put a link in the video description now where to get it so to make gummy bears all you need is 1/2 a cup of cold water in a small saucepan over medium heat and then you add 4 packages of unflavored gelatin and about 2 tbsp of granulated sugar make I separated the gelatin mixture into four bowls and then I added a little bit of gel food coloring into each one and then I use the provided pipette then pipe the gummy bear mixture into the gummy bear modes I put the gummy bear modes into the freezer for about 20 minutes and once they are completely solid I removed it from the gummy bear modes to my surprise it came out very easy it's easier to take out the gummy bears if you flip the gummy bear mode to the other side and press down the gummy bears popped right out of the mode and the mode is quite clean afterwards so you don't have to do a lot of scrubbing or claiming to decorate a mini gummy bear cake I cut a cupcake in a circle shape and then I use a basket-weave tip and pipe white buttercream frosting all around the sides and on top I used a spatula to smooth out the icing to me this is the easiest way to cover a cake with frosting for the bottom I am using a cupcake liner that I flipped inside out I love eating gummy bears especially when it just came out of the freezer what kind of gummy candies do you like please leave a comment for one of the many cakes I left it smooth and then another mini cake I roughed it up with a spatula like this last but not least cover the cake with gummy bears one way to decorate the cake with gummy bears is that you can take a handful of random color gummy bears and covered a whole cake with it or you can make the bottom border of the cake one solid color and place a gummy bear on top next time I use the gummy bear mode I think I'm gonna make some gummy bear vitamins or chocolate-covered gummy bears now that sounds very delicious if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and tell others about it thank you so much for watching you", "IpnKEQquxi0": "i'm sheeta shinday and i'm gonna be talking about this product today these are purna women's vitamin gummy bears so apparently uh the diet that we consume doesn't exactly include all essential vitamins that are required for your body especially as women we miss out on a lot of those and pure gummy bears are basically these really delicious and cute gummies they are gluten free and uh you get like one box of this so basically this one bottle contains a month supply that are 30 gummy bears you're supposed to take one each day to them and then swallow these so i did not have any specific medical condition before consuming these and i didn't have any deficiency so if you are going to consume these for that i can't really say how it's going to work out but my honest review um didn't drastically change anything in my life but again uh as i said a lot of our diets don't include a lot of vitamins and uh essentials that are supposed to be taken and this is a good way to consume those and it's a very delicious and easy way", "D--AfKOBJB0": "[Music] what up y'all that [ __ ] came to me how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking

today and of course out here with my dad we are on the boat we are largemouth fishing and this is the very first gummy worm fishing challenge ever check out the bait lineup we have horrible part about I say snakes we are using nothing but gummy worms in this morning it is summertime so it gets very hot we're only in a fish probably till about 11:00 or so look these are stuck together you know I'm actually gonna leave them stuck together okay that's just the way they come they literally they come to snakes oh I just put bones okay well they come to snakes stuck together do you want to use them yes archers that's actually a perfect color and then we have here this is I've never seen this is called the all-star mix trolley they have little people I guess we'll get to that in a second that's kind of a weird color we have octopus check out that that is gonna come in fact I'm gonna set that guy that is a special one we're gonna set that onto the site we have let's see where's a long I know we have llamas name there we go we got a llama Roland a llama might come into play and the other one I'm most confident about out of all of them simply because we've caught trout I've never caught a bass on the gummy new Breton lure but we have caught trout on these before and this is actually what I'll start off with is a nice a little gummy worm their first ever gummy fishing challenge so I'm just gonna rig this gummy worm just like you would any other plastic bait just Texas rig got a paid one eight ounce sinker well fishing pretty shallow water you don't need a lot of weight paint sinker and there you go guys and so we have a Texas rig gummy worm right there black forced everyone let's see how this works guys I got one I got one on a gummy worm yes on a gummy worm Oh literally it's huge - look at that it's huge it's huge it's a tank are you kidding me look at you grab it don't worry about that don't worry about that just oh my goodness no look the gummy worm fell off must have fallen off in the fight it's not it's kind of brittle holy heck that's like the biggest large oh they cut all year on this lake is crazy guys like the second cast of the day big budget guys unfortunately our scale or our yeah our scale is not it's out the batteries aren't working but this isn't almost 20 inch largemouth good grief this is probably solid 4 pounder probably yeah the Willie go-go board hasn't put it over 4 pounds that is a my biggest this is guys this is the biggest bass of the year for me right here on a gummy where that is crazy the second it was either the second or third cast of the day my biggest pass of the year on a gummy worm I thought at the start of this day if I catch one fish something gummy I'll be super happy and so that's just that's amazing so I'm not taking anything for granted let's see if we can get another fish on this you know guys I had planned on using some of these octopus and stuff next and I will I want to see if I can get another one I'm just the regular gummy worm red and green there we go let's give it a go these octopus and llamas and snakes they'll come into play later oh you had one fallen oh my dad just had one follow up on his uh his gummy this is funny here have been wasting money on five dollar packs of baits and I could have been I could have in a dollar bag of gummy worms yeah they'd be fighting as a fishin troll tournament with nothing but gommi guys I'm gonna switch up to an orange and yellow one they kind of come off the hook easily so we might go through this bag pretty fast like that so maybe it's like something unusual they've never seen and it smells different than anything they've ever seen and so who knows and I'm not trying to jinx the day just cuz we caught one but we'll see if we catch more but that's another theory and all the parties I think it came up just all right guys check it out I'm switching to a little you know I'm it makes the kind of Carolina rig a little bit this octopus see if we catch someone and gummy octopus let's see if the llama turns things around not even hook a llama and hook the llama through the foot and then put the hook point in his head there we go that'll be good action in the water oh I missed him I did on the llama that was he started take off with it dang it grabbed the llama pulled him off almost pulled him off the hook they call this one Cusco my dad has a tough morning efficient besides it's been good for me but with my gummy worms I wouldn't say that turned our day around no no but it got the money got the monkey off my back a little larger ah nice got one annika me where he snagged he snagged though oh my line is tangled I was wondering what was I can still feel him on there he's still on look there you serious oh that was that was crazy got snagged I thought here's what I think so these baths are just used to eating protein all day and they see that little sweet snack I know they've never seen anything like it before Wow guys ii gummy worm a fish ever another another like solid I've switched back to like I'll show you guys what I switch to they caught this one on a different I've been trying just like every gummy worm in the pack that one on the Black Forest ones but this time it was an orange and yellow gummy worm I've been throwing everything dinosaurs everything we got snakes and this is tell you what maybe it's a finessed and I'd say maybe the sugars coming off of that thing because it's kind of melting in this warm water each worm only lasts about 5 or 10 minutes but maybe that's the key to it at 2:00 today well guys I'm happy that I caught - I can't believe they cut - do you did on gummy worms but the gummy worms as you can see you're starting to just fall apart fall off the hook the fish bone apart easily well guys if you enjoyed this video preached plus the like on it and we'll do another gummy worm challenge and it differently hopefully on a day when it a little bit better then you guys so

Today we're making\u00a0delicious and super fun gummy bear cookies. They're so tasty, look amazing and are perfect\u00a0for this holiday season.  So, let's bake!  This cookie\u00a0\u00a0dough is super simple.  All you need to do is mix\u00a0240 g of butter with 150 g of sugar and\u00a05 g of salt.  I add my salt with the butter and\u00a0sugar. I think it gives the cookie the right balance\u00a0of sweetness. \u00a0Mix until creamy and a lighter colour.\u00a0 Over medium to high speed.   Add one beaten egg,  and one tsp of vanilla paste or extract.\u00a0\u00a0 Mix until well combined.  Add 440 g of\u00a0flour and mix over low speed until combined.\u00a0 Don't over mix it, this part needs to be\u00a0\nreally gentle so you don't get hard cookies. Press the dough over your table or cooking station,\u00a0making it flat, and cover it with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Bring the dough from the fridge and, between two pieces of parchment paper,\u00a0\u00a0 roll the dough until it's\u00a0about a half a cm thick.\u00a0\u00a0 Cut using cookie cutters.  I'm using\u00a0a star shape, Christmas Tree and a circle. You need to use the cutters\u00a0where you also have the exact\u00a0shapes but smaller,  so you\u00a0can cut out to the middle. If the dough gets too soft, put it in the fridge to firm before removing the smaller cutter. Roll out the remaining dough again. Put all cookies into the freezer for\u00a0\nabout 10 to 20 minutes until they get\u00a0\u00a0 really hard and pre-heat your oven. For the\u00a0gummy bear candies, I like to use the sour ones, Which gives the cookies a nice tartness\u00a0\nthat balances well with the sweetness.\u00a0\u00a0 Pick the colours of gummy bears you want. I'm using some holiday colours. Cutting them will help them melt and spread\u00a0better. This will also help you fill all your edges. Take the dough from the freezer\u00a0and separate your cookies. Roll all the remaining dough again.  Bake the\u00a0cookies for about seven minutes until you see\u00a0the bottoms start to get lightly golden. Add the gummy bears in the centre of the cookies.  Add the thinner pieces at the\u00a0edges so they spread it evenly. Put them back in the oven and bake them for\u00a0another 5 minutes, until the bears are all melted. And the cookies are lightly golden on the top. You can also use a wooden stick to spread them and mix up the colours more if you want. You can check while they're baking\u00a0if the centres are too shallow,\u00a0\u00a0 and can add more gummies, it depends on\u00a0the way you shape them, so be aware. After the cookies are ready let them\u00a0\ncool completely before moving them. When the cookies are cool, they will remove\u00a0easily leaving you with a perfect cookie. These holiday gummy bear cookies\u00a0are perfect for any occasion, and bring amazing colour and flavours to your\u00a0table.  Fresh, tasty and an unexpected sour punch. Anyone who is lucky enough to try one, will just love them.  I hope you loved this recipe.\u00a0\u00a0 For more amazing recipes and food adventures, don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel.

(laughing) That's right, that's how we feed our boys.", "hzwsFAMbkjk": "hey pepper geeks today we're going to make spicy gummy bears so this recipe is very versatile if you don't want to make the gummy bear spicy you can just leave the hot peppers out of the recipe it's very simple you can get creative with any kind of jello that you want and any kind of hot pepper today we're going to use habanero peppers but you can use ghost peppers if you want you can make this with carolina reapers if you want a really spicy gummy bear these are some gummy bears i made the other day they are strawberry lime habanero gummy bears they taste pretty much like a strawberry gummy bear but with a little bit of a kick to them to make the spicy gummy bears all you're going to need is one pack of jello one box of jello three ounces you're gonna need one packet of knox gelatin one box usually comes with four packets all you're going to need is the one packet you're going to need a tablespoon of lime juice you can also use lemon three to four habaneros or whatever spicy pepper you're using chopped and seeded you're gonna need half a cup of cold water a quarter cup of honey you can also use corn syrup it works very well you don't want to use regular sugar or else the gummy bears are going to come out too crystallized so the first thing that we're going to do is essentially make a hot pepper juice you're going to take you're going to need a fine mesh strainer for this and what you're gonna do is blend up your habaneros with the half a cup of cold water to make a hot pepper juice so the chopped peppers are gonna go right in the blender and then you're gonna add half a cup of cold water definitely make sure it's cold if you're sensitive to spice or if you're using really really hot peppers now's probably a good time to wear a mask or goggles [Music] that's good so you're going to blend those peppers up with the water as much as you can there's still going to be chunks in there that's fine we're using our strainer whatever pot that you're using the hot pepper water is going to go right in but first you're going to want to take your jello so we have one box of lime jello and your one packet of gelatin right in there give it a little stir so that it's you know the powders are mixed together good now all of your liquid ingredients are going to go in so careful opening this because if you're using really hot peppers you're gonna kind of get a big whiff of spice there good time to wear a mask or goggles like i said but i'm just gonna just gonna wing it today you're gonna use your fine mesh strainer here and just real gently pour that hot pepper juice in you're straining out all the pepper chunks all right so you're going to have about a half a cup maybe a little bit less in here with that all right just gonna give it a real gentle stir and you're gonna add your lime juice the lime juice adds a nice little kick it also serves as a to preserve them a little bit and you're going to add your quarter cup of honey or corn syrup whichever you're using you want to stir very gently try not to make too many air bubbles and don't use a whisk because the air bubbles are going to carry over into the gummy bears so you want to just be as gentle as possible after stirring it you're going to actually leave this to sit for about five minutes you want the gelatin to bloom so we're gonna leave that to sit for five minutes before we heat it all right so now the jello has been sitting for about five minutes you'll notice it's a little more transparent now we're gonna pop it on the heat on medium heat we're gonna do about three minutes you don't want the jello to boil you don't want those air bubbles in real gentle with the stirring we're gonna throw it on the heat now all right so we heated up our mixture over medium heat stirred it really well and we're gonna let this cool for about five to ten minutes before putting them into the molds so these gummy bear molds we got off of amazon they're silicone molds you can get them at a craft store amazon's a good choice though some people do recommend that you spray them with cooking spray before making the candy but i would not recommend doing that i did experiment with using cooking spray and without using cooking spray the ones that were sprayed ended up very greasy and kind of gross so i had no issue getting these guys out of the molds without cooking spray so we're going to skip that step all right so just let this sit for five to ten minutes you want the air bubbles to rise to the top and you want it to get a little bit more clear and transparent colored alright so our gelatin candy syrup mixture has been sitting for five minutes it's nice and clear it's a little bit dark and now we get to fill the gummy bear molds so this kit came with a little dropper most of them do you're gonna just fill up the dropper you want to be careful not to tilt it because it'll just come dripping out like that so just fill it and leave it down and if you notice air bubbles coming up squirt it out and then just fill it up again so get your dropper nice and full and the fun part filling the molds one by one all right so these gummy bears have been completely filled we do have some bubbly bears some air bubbles got in there but that's okay they will still taste good so these guys are gonna sit out for 10 minutes at room temp before putting them into the fridge for an hour the pipette as well as your pans and dishes whatever you use to make this recipe you're going to want to clean this stuff right away because the gelatin hardens up it'll be impossible to clean all right guys the gummy bears have been chilling in the fridge for one hour and now we are ready to pop them out they are still really really sticky but that's normal and these molds you know you really just have to flip them inside out and the gummy bears will pop right out you don't need to use cooking oil just pop them out one by one and you're gonna lay them flat on a cutting board so here's the thing these gummy bears are all set and ready to eat right now however if you want them to be chewy like a true gummy bear you're actually gonna let these guys dehydrate a bit so for 48 hours we're gonna leave these guys to dehydrate you do not want to put these in a dehydrator because the heat will melt them and make a huge mess so i popped out about half of the gummy bears um the rest are still in the molds but these guys have to sit out for 24-48 hours 48 hours will really give you a good firm gummy bear texture you can kind of see the difference between the fresh gummy bears and the ones that have already dehydrated the fresh gummy bears are bigger they're a lot softer the ones that have dehydrated or they shrink and they're actually firmer more like a traditional gummy bear one really good way to dehydrate them is just to get a strainer and pop it right on top so that air is still getting through and just leave them out for 24 hours and then you can flip them so they're standing and do it again for a day and you'll notice as you munch on them throughout the days that they're getting a little bit firmer and firmer all right so let's taste one of these habanero lime gummies the lime i like much better than the strawberry habanero actually it's a much better flavor feel free to experiment with the flavors and the peppers if you try this recipe at home leave a comment let us know what flavors you used we'd love to try some new combinations and these guys are still really soft i'm going to leave them out for a couple days let them harden up when they get to the desired consistency that you like throw them in a ziploc bag or a little container keep them in the fridge try to eat them within a couple of weeks if they last that long so that's all there is to it homemade spicy gummy bears be sure to go over to the peppergeek.com blog if you want to see this recipe and

[Music]", "vUNWbXCRmvc": "easy do [Music] you", "BvJGGEUKwnY": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so in today's video we're gonna be attempting to make some unfunny bears I got this little kit out of Cracker Barrel and I thought it would be pretty cool to try to make some gummy bears so if you guys are interested in watching this video let's get right to it okay so first thing first we have to unbox this it does come with instructions okay hopefully the lighting is okay here right they come with cherry blue raspberry unflavored gelatin I said okay guys so we have the little tray right here so cute and then we have a little dropper so that we can put off for a little chilly mix in there anyways so I show you guys a little tray right here so cute look at that okay we're gonna start reading the instructions I don't know what this is this is a cherry mix unflavored gelatin and then the blue raspberry I think I'm gonna do the blue raspberry ones just because that's on the ball like oh my try that okay let's let's get started okay since I'm doing a blue raspberry gummy bears you will need 1.8 L to do raspberry gummy mix point 15 ounce unflavored gelatin mix I don't even think I have the measurements let's try to get them okay so I found some measuring cups and obsessed to do 1.8 ounce of the see the blue raspberry gummy mix and this is 1/4 cup it which means is 59 meters or whatever that is and the 1.8 ounce I search on Google it's 53 millimeters so I'm gonna have to kind of wing it here so hopefully prank that it comes out this and if you hear like my dishwasher in the background sorry for that it takes like two hours to freakin watch dishes anyways okay let's see anyways let's just watch it's actually blue I'm dumb I thought it would just be like sugar yeah I don't know wondering I have to put 53 millimeters if this is 15 I'm winking at you guys okay I'm gonna leave it like that okay guys because it's not supposed to hold a little bit more a little bit okay the next thing on our list is to get point 15 ounce of unflavored gelatin it I'm really struggling you guys okay guys I think that the directions right I just need to put this in my array right here and there we have to get 15 I mean point 15 ounces but I'll flavor just mix okay I'll do it right okay guys I did my little calculation and I have to do 4 milliliters of the non flavored gelatin but I have a 5 right here so we're just gonna do 5 good okay we're just gonna do this one okay we're gonna add this into our little mix so far this is what it looks like let me see about the fence if I put you guys here the lighting kind of sucks like right here I will dark but whatever so next thing I have to do is put Oh to see two tablespoons wait wait I'm so confused it says combine a blue raspberry gummy mix point fifteen ounces of unflavored gelatin mix and two tablespoons plus two tablespoons water stir microwave on HIGH 30 seconds I'm comfy use okay we're just gonna put water okay guys I figured it out we're gonna do four of these five milliliter little teaspoons in use [Music] okay I'm gonna stir it because it says to stir and then microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds and then do it again use me use this we got a start okay guys I'm going to add some acidity in here because I'm trying to make some CD gun bears because that's - well you're right here I have the Kois 3000 a CBD natural whatever I'm gonna be like three droplets into this I'm stressed all the time and this helps me a lot gotta shake it shake it shake it okay we're gonna put three jumpers are actually round out another one I use which is a blue raspberry flavored ice gets out of new reg right hopefully oh my gosh it's gonna taste like weed okay we're gonna put 1 2 & 3 so that's about 9,000 that's nine thousand milligrams CBD into that so I'll chop I not do the math but if it gummy bear it's gonna have some type of CD in it cuz they're not chose one it like tastes like weed I guess I'm sure guys what it looks like before I'm microwaving so pretty much I'm just turning it everything ok I think I'm just gonna keep stirring okay guys let's go ahead and microwave this for 30 seconds and then we'll stir again because it says to soar again and then do 30 more seconds okay I sense I'm dumb and I don't know if I could put this in the microwave oh oh my gosh I like it I just don't wanna like chassis it might cat so I'm gonna put it in this cup right here beautiful cut and then we're gonna microwave it [Music] okay go ahead for 30 seconds and then we will be right back okay this is the first little round it looks already kind of get kind of get to eat I don't even know if I'm playing in focus let's go ahead and stir it again Steve microwave 30 seconds stir and then microwave again mr. branch side of tray very lightly with cooking spray so we're gonna get some cooking spray with you and that's that fine you guys got the cookie spray go ahead and put it except to put like a thin layer okay now we have agility then this smells like correct I shouldn't have put that CBD in there but oh well that's kind of kind of mess with the flavor go ahead and stir it okay next one we have to do let's see sprin set of train very lightly oops I did a lot fill bear shaped cavities with mix using dropper under feeling slightly so don't put it all the way refrigerate for 20 minutes it makes 50 gummy bears our guys I'm gonna have 50 cbdu gummy bitters all right let's go ahead and put all these little gummy bears in - dude it's scary you guys I feel like I should probably like No you're good you're good I was gonna say properly like rinse it somehow right they said to not fill it all the way oh my gosh oh my gosh you get a better angle because this ain't working all right let's get this close by let's do this scared [Music] okay guys I call the gummy bears filled up it's kind of messy but don't judge me on that you guys let's go ahead and put these in the fridge I need to be there for 20 minutes they're gonna be sitting here for 20 minutes we'll be back when it's 20 minutes okay guys it's been 20 minutes we're gonna go ahead and try these outs hey guys hold up I'm gonna try to angle just right it's been 20 minutes my hair is like poof puffed out or whatever it's been 20 minutes and this is how okay I've been go ahead and angle this better we're gonna go ahead and try it out hopefully they taste good go ahead and try one let's see if that even chilly oh my gosh it's so cute oh my fellow uh-oh it's gooey here's the first little gummy bear you guys I don't want to grab it right cuz like hold on we are gonna try to grab it it's kind of oily because of all the friends stuff I put on it look at the little gummy bear oh okay we're gonna try this out this one's tiny but I have oh my gosh it's good if it's like blueberry you couldn't you can barely taste the CBD right could taste it so I do the math and there's about 180 milligrams of CBD in each of these little gummy bears so I would have to eat like 20 to get like the effect of like being calm and not being so insight I like so much anxiety oh my gosh look at how cute the berries oh my gosh they don't gummy bear actually really good so I'm gonna say this is a success these gummy bears are delicious Oh what got one that has like a lot of that marijuana taste but overall they thanks beautifully they do taste like blue raspberry so it's that's cool um but yeah I did good I did good okay I'm gonna go ahead and take a whole bunch out and then we'll see how they look together okay guys are you ready to see my little gummy bear crowd it's so cute look at all the gummy bears I need I can't believe I made gummy bears you guys look how cute they are they're so tiny you're trying to get my dogs Oh like you guys my little gummy bear it's so tiny but then we have all the other coming bears in the back oh they look like little Legos okay guys it's gonna be the end of this video hope you guys enjoyed it I made these little little tiny gummi bears it was pretty easy to make the only thing I recommend don't put too much cooking spray like I did cuz they're all slimy and they're hard to take out of the little trays after but anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys the next one strawberry cake", "8deEGBKOykQ": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be making some keto sugar-free gummies I totally love these gummies I love that there's no food coloring and they're so simple to make they're easy they're kid-approved you can take them on the go and they're really low-calorie so if you want to see how to make these and how to customize them yourself then go ahead and keep watching the video you don't need that many things you're gonna need some hot water some teabags some gelatin liquid sweetener and some mix-ins if you'd like to switch up the flavors today I'm going for Tazo passion tea I love this blend it's so delicious it's very fruity so I love that I can make some fruit gummies and I also love that I can make sour gummies which I'll show you how I do that in just a second I like to use something with a spout so this little measuring cup works perfect for this if you don't have a water kettle then you're gonna want a microwave or boil your water ahead of time and then let it steep in this little pitcher so that there's a spout on it so after it cools down I put it in the refrigerator to chill completely look how dark that is it's just so good it extracted all of that delicious flavor from the teabags and you don't have to squeeze out your teabags like I do but I like to get all the liquid out some T's it can make the liquid cloudy and if you want to avoid that to make nice clear gummies just don't squeeze it I don't have a problem with this specific tea so at this point you with your cold liquid you're gonna add your gelatin you can get this kind of gelatin which you would just have to measure out with a table spoon or a scale like I'm doing here and I'm gonna measure out 28 grams but you can also use the packets and it's four tablespoons or four packets so I'm gonna measure out 28 grams which is also equal to one ounce on my scale and then I'm gonna stir that in completely you want to mix it in really really really well and if your liquid is cold it'll mix in really well so when you do chill it make sure you chill your tea down all the way and then you're gonna microwave it for 30 seconds three times depending on your microwave until it's completely liquid and hot and then I just like to give it one more stir just to make sure that it's totally incorporated I like liquid sucralose you guys can use whatever sweetener you want you can use granular sweetener and just make sure that it's hot enough to mix in and totally dissolve the sweetener so I like to use a roughly half of a teaspoon of sweetener you can use liquid stevia if you'd like and then at this point you'll add in all of your mix ins you can do apple cider vinegar for Tang but I want mine really sour so I went ahead and I'm going to use some citric acid I have a bunch of this stuff it's food grade and it's totally fine to add if you don't want to use some sort of man-made substance then you can use lemon or whatever else you'd like so just mix it in really really well you want that completely dissolved because that stuff is super sour and if you'd like you can add your extracts I have lemon and raspberry but I'm not gonna add anything else to mine but that's just an option I want to let you guys know about so give a one final little stir always taste your mixture because that's what your gummies are gonna taste like I wanted mine just a little bit more sweet so I added a little bit more liquid sucralose you know do what you guys want to do if you want I'm super sweet Yolo just do whatever you want to do and then I am going to scrape off all the bubbles because once this sets the bubbles are going to basically dry on top and to avoid it looking not so appealing you just go ahead and scrape those off it's not a big deal I really love this mold I got it at a thrift store but I'm pretty sure that you could find something similar on eBay or Amazon and it works really well for these little individual gummies if you're extra just scrape off the top again just to make sure that they're nice and clear and chill them all the way so those are easy to remove from the mold and this is what you're left with eat some and then package the rest up I keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're nice and chewy every single time I want one and I hope you guys try this out if you do leave me a comment down below let me know what you think thank you so much for watching you guys

snack we're going to be having this a gummy pickle with real pickle taste so let's see what this tastes like i'm kind of nervous because i love pickles but just like the thought of like real pickle taste on a gummy i don't know about that okay let's check it out it smells like oh my god i was gonna say it smells like green apple but i can literally smell the pickle now oh i don't know this is gonna be good okay let's try it out oh my god it's so bad so disgusting this is no for me this is i cannot even swallow this it's like sweet and then you get like the actual flavor of the pickle this is a no-go for me so i will see you guys in a couple hours for lunch time hopefully for lunch time we have better luck than our snacks two hours later okay guys it's been a couple hours and now it is time for lunch my stomach is growling and it's also hurting a little bit i don't know if it's because i'm hungry or if it's because all this candy is starting to get to me but either way it's lunch time so i do want to eat so cameraman what do we have for lunch oh you have pizza a hot dog a cheeseburger and a coke okay so for 2021 i was like you know what i'm gonna eat healthy but i guess 2021 had other plans for me and i mean i'm not married so let's try it so we do have some pizza with no veggies okay just the pepperoni and cheese awesome this is what it looks like oh it smells really good okay honestly after this video i think i'm gonna have to go to the dentist there's like so much tugging and they're so like hard to chew i'm just like you know but it's really good i can definitely taste this is like a strawberry flavor it's really good this is definitely vanilla and this is orange right here so this is not bad it's actually pretty good i'm really excited for this hot dog though look at this look at the detail we have the bun veggies the sausage and then we have the mustard and the ketchup now it's a little bit hard to take out just because it's not like a whole piece you do have to take it like one by one trying to pick it up can you let me see let's try this there we go so let's try it out what flavor is this that is so freaking good that is the best one that i've tried so far today now we're gonna try the cheeseburger there's lettuce the bun the meat the cheese and everything it's just it's really well made so let's give it a try do you guys want to take a bite now let me take a bite oh dang i don't need to go to the gym this was definitely a workout it's pretty good but it's not one of my favorite ones next thing that we're going to try is the gummy coke i am really excited for this one just because like i love the mini gummy ones that are like the coke flavor so this one i know it's going to be good so let's give it a try that sounded really painful it wasn't painful though it just sounded like you know it wasn't that bad mmm does it taste like the mini ones mm-hmm i have to say our lunch was very successful i cannot wait for dessert because i know dessert's gonna be extra sweet so i will see you guys in about 40 minutes to an hour so we can have dessert and then we're gonna have dinner so yeah i'll see you guys in a bit for dessert i have ice cream and i also have a donut they both look pretty good but i think the donut's gonna be better which one do you think's gonna taste better the donut looks pretty fine right i really like how it has like the chocolate detail and like even the sprinkles so i have the ice cream we're gonna try it out to see what it tastes like vanilla look i was expecting i was like this would be vanilla for sure it is vanilla i'm also going to try the little cone strawberry this one is the one that i'm really excited for oh not me ruining the chocolate i really want to try the chocolate so i'm going to give it a try it tastes just like chocolate really well that's good so the donut one has two layers i'm gonna try the strawberry one first this one it tastes just like the chocolate drizzle on top of the donut overall i really think that the donut one was my favorite one just because like i had a lot of different flavors going on versus like the ice cream cone so i have to say this one is my favorite one so i'm going to sit here and enjoy my dessert and then we'll see what we have for dinner it is time for our last meal of the day yay i'm lucky so happy because i'm like i'm ready for some real food i'm tired of candy honestly after this video i don't think i'm gonna have candy for a very very long time so for a dinner we're having a whole buffet we do have a sushi here we also have some noodles as well as a taco now fun fact i don't know if any of you guys know this but i have never ever ever in my life tried sushi like raw sushi my mom never let me eat sushi so this is the closest i'm ever gonna get to sushi so let's see let's try i'm guessing this is kind of like the soy sauce the details i know it's so cute i really like how they put like the detail in like the rose look at this i don't know what this is supposed to be because i'm not really into sushi let's try this one it's like a double roll me trying to use chopsticks and i don't even know how to use them these are some of my favorite candies but usually i get like the peach ones i have never tried the green ones what flavor is this oh this is apple i have never tried apple ones i usually always get like the peach ones but this is really good i also want to try this one because i think this one has like a marshmallow oh the marshmallow you have to try this that is good it's like so soft and chewy that one is pretty good that one is really good i also want to try the noodles you should try one of these let's try is it lemon i don't know what is it i don't think this has a flavor it sounds crunchy oh it tastes like perfume why does it taste like perfume i don't know oh yeah no i'm not a big fan of that one no let's try some noodles this is what i'm talking about also look at the detail of this it even comes with a little egg so let's try the noodles let's try to slap the noodles impossible i really want to try the little egg oh these what are these thinking it's like marshmallow it's really it has it's like coated in sugar it looks like a marshmallow reminds me of peeps it reminds me of the peeps that's banana flavor that's really good look at this taco i'm really sad this is cardboard i really wish that like they can make the shell like gummy i feel like that would have been awesome but look at everything that's inside you should try to bite everything at the same time these are really really tough to chew guys but i have to say my favorite ones that i tried from everything were these especially because of the marshmallow it was so good also the little green rings i have never tried apple flavor so that was my first time trying it as well of this so i guess kind of like the marshmallows were like my favorite ones just because they weren't like so tough on my teeth and i wasn't like yanking on them but overall i have to say today's video was pretty successful after this video i am not going to have any more gummy bears or anything that is gummy related i'm not going to be eating it for a while i am so glad that this challenge has come to an end because right now all i can think about is just in and out a real burger with some real fries and a real drink yes that is exactly what i deserve because i feel like i put meat in my stomach through a lot after this video so don't mind me guys i'm going to go get some real food because i am literally done with this gummy food all right guys that is the end of today's video thank god because i am so done eating all this gummy food for 24 hours i really hope you enjoyed today's video if

just want to win l.a baby who we running with i'm yeah", "ppi0khS0s_8": "you want to taste this at your gas in it's pretty sour okay oh my god you better water everyone I'm Claire I'm in the v8s kitchen and today I am making gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "QQ2Vt35RJgM": "gummy whoa it

good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all these videos also if you're interested in supporting off of youtube make sure you check out our patreon page it's going to be linked in the description you get a lot of things for your pledges every month and it really does help make these videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that you found this video helpful before we get up out of here i do want to do today's subscriber spotlight today's subscriber spotlight goes out to miss aldine

everybody I've got a really good\nrecipe today I'm gonna show you how to make sour\ngummy candy this stuff tastes better than the one get store and it's really easy to make you just need a few ingredients.  for the\nwet ingredients one cup of apple juice and one half cup of corn syrup for the dry ingredients you need a six-ounce pack of Jell-O or 2 three ounce packs.  today I'm trying it with strawberry and you need a matching pack of Kool-Aid.  ideally you should have the same flavor. you can mix and match but until you get the hang of this I would stick with the same flavors Jell-O/Kool-Aid combinations that work: Grape/Grape Lime/Lemon-Lime Cherry/Cherry Watermelon/Fruit-Punch you need four envelopes of gelatin.  if you\nstart making this regular which you might it's going to be cheaper if you get the twelve packs and you need some citric acid (1 tablespoon or 15ml) this you can buy at any pharmacy or\nchemist depending on what part of the world\nyou're in and but they might have to order it for you but it's usually takes a day or so it's\ndefinitely worth the wait. so what you're going to do is turn the heat on to medium, about. that's not going to burn the pot, don't worry about it the liquid is going to be in pretty quick. you get one cup of clear unsweetened apple juice. if it's a little short or over, it doesn't matter then get 1/2 cup of golden corn server and measure that pour that in now for this recipe you should have a silicon spatula it just makes life just so much easier for\nall of it give that a brief stir and just let that come to a full boil over medium heat while the liquids are heating up, I'm going to prepare the dry ingredients start with the Jell-O, cut the pack open get that in a bowl with a tablespoon next the Kool-Aid. there's no particular way to mix this up so it doesn't matter how you do it then the gelatin. I like using scissors for this saves a little bit of time. cut the tops off, pop that all in there now the citric acid you got to be really\ncareful with this okay you definitely don't want to put too\nmuch though like any dish you can adjust it for taste so that's all the dry stuff in what you're going to do is carefully mix this up, picking up the powder from the bottom until it looks \nbasically even the liquid hasn't come to a boil yet what I'm going to do is prepare the pan in the meantime for the pan I use tin foil cake pans\naround 7-8 inches something like, and I get some plastic wrap so what do you do you tear off enough of a long piece so that you will have some overlap and make sure you do this away\nfrom the stove heat okay you definitely don't want this near an open flame, it will melt pretty quick press the plastic wrap into the pan like that so on either of the short sides nearly up and that you've got a really good overlap on\nthe far sides take that away for a bit it's nearly reached a boil at this point if you're going to be\nwatching it constantly, yes it is safe to turn the heat right up now what's important is that you do not\nsplash liquid up the side of the pan because if you do it will stick and it\nwill burn which is what you don't want alright.  so what I'm going to do is carefully nudge the heat up here okay so this is the stage of boil you're\nlooking for you'll notice on the far side of the pan a \nlittle bit did splash up and burn but as long as I don't pour the candy out through that, it should be okay if you want to test it what you do is gently move the spatula through the bottom of the pan and it comes to a full boil.  that's what\nI'm looking for turn the heat off put that to the side. get your dry ingredients ready and basically just pour them right in like that. set that to the side and now turn the heat back on right down to low heat though the purpose is this is to keep just enough heat going under this\nthat the gelatin dissolves completely before I put it in the pan it's been two or three minutes at low heat and what I've been doing is I have been\nscraping down the sides avoiding the burned patch to get the mixture back down into the main mass of ingredient here. it's very important\nthat you stir gently because even with that you can see that there are air bubbles that have been put into the gelatin and you\nreally don't want that it'll clear up when it settles but you still may have some on the top okay for this part I do get a glove because the pan has become pretty hot. and I'm going to pour very very slowly and if you'll notice the burnt piece is\nnot in here there you go now for those of you that don't like those\nbubbles on the top I'll show you quick how to do this like I said all you're going to do is lose\ncandy and once it's cold no one is really going to notice and no one is going to fault you for having an air bubble in things that taste this good, and if they do well just don't give them any, alright. there you go. pick that off, scrape it into a bowl and go again and if there's some that just won't quit you can just nudge them off into a corner I'm going to let this set on the counter top basically until it doesn't jiggle see that, there is way too much motion and\nwhen it's nearly set, I'll pop it in the fridge for a few hours and I'll show you how to cut it. so the gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours that's what it looks like now. this should come out quite easily. you just grab it on both sides there pull it right out of the pan, put the pan on the side that's clean. you can give it a quick wipe if you want and definitely use that again. before you turn it over you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is not stuck in too bad it looks pretty good so it's going to take it quick, turn it over, then giving it a tug from the sides you want to make sure it's all clean that edge is up, that's good see what I'm doing there, hold it flat that came off all in one piece what you're going to do is start cutting. make sure your hands are clean it's still a bit sticky. you're going to cut it in pieces like that. you can either use a small knife like I've got if you want to get fancy and do worms and stuff, you can do that actually I think I will get a larger knife, it's a lot easier and I'll show you, just a minute if you get a nice French knife and after you cut one strip off what you do is get there kind of rock it through what you want to do is pull off strips like this once you've got your strip pulled off, I would do them all in strips like that first so once you've got enough room, then you want to start cutting them up like that in little squares that's what I have that bowl there for see on the other side there you might have a few air bubbles and who\ncares. I think those are pretty good treat size I'm going to finish chopping these up there is today's recipe, sour gummy\ncandy I really hope you guys try this out,  it's\njust awesome, it really really is look at the color of that and if you wanted, you could if you\nwanted get a cookie cutter or something and maybe do little shapes or stars or whatever\nyou felt like if you could get a small enough cookie cutter for this.  personally once people have tasted these things, they won't really care what they look like so once again thank you for watching my\nstuff and I'll see again", "Y6orR8ckPWs": "- That's good, I was planning\non shitting my brains out. - Oh!\n- I knew it.
