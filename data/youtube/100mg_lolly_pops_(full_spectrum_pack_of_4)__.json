{"ZH6vd933qSo": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back to my channel my name is Kristin every all that is new to my channel today place it thread button to be linked in to my future videos and make sure you click the bell so you'll be notified of my next video in today's video I've got the fake versus real pink me pops so the fake fake me pops actually came in this box so here's the front of the box then this is the back this is supposed to be all the picki box that you can collect so let's go ahead and open up this box and then I've got both of them inside I've got the real and the fake pick me pop inside so when we're actually going to be doing today we're gonna be opening up both pick me pops we're gonna compare them side by side and we're gonna see what the differences are just so you don't accidentally purchase a fake pick me pop so let's go ahead and pull them both out and I do kind of look a lot alike the package is almost the same color this is a season 2 real pick me pop and this is a season 1 fake pick me pop so let's go ahead and take a look at the packaging now as you can already tell they both have this little bit tag and they both say they're made by moose toys let's go ahead and look at the contents because I just looked at the contents a minute ago and notice something super hilarious so in the real pygmy pop it says it includes two scented plush one medium lollipop vessel for surprise items to surprise messages one lollipops and three danglers strings and one collector's guide so here's exactly what I read and then I'm gonna read you what the fake pygmy pop says so the content in the fake pick me pop include one scented plush one small lollipop vessel one surprise message one lollipop stand and one dance flourish strength not Danglars string but dance let's drop so we got one canceller string and one collector side somebody give you an up-close view of that so if you can see that I don't know if my cameras focusing but it says dance ler not dangler and then we're also gonna compare the front so in this size pygmy pop you're supposed to always get two plushies so in the real one we're gonna get two plushies and in the fake one it says we're only gonna get one Flushing let's go to take a look at the back and then on the back it both says WWE pygmy pops calm so they both have the website and then I just noticed something else on the real pygmy pop there's actually a full here so there's an easy pull to actually open up this picnic pop and then on the faith one there is not an easy pull so you just gotta kind of rip off the wrapper so we're gonna start with this real one and we're gonna start with this little bitty easy cool and this is our real picnic pop so we're gonna go ahead and open up the fake picnic pop and we're gonna keep comparing these side-by-side then here's what they both look like and I also want to add that they have a design on the bottom of the pygmy pop and they both have the same exact design so let's light and start by open up the fake pick me pop first so in the fake pick me pop it comes with two surprise bags and a set of stickers now these stickers look a lot like the real pygmy pop stickers so let's go ahead and set that down really quick and then we're gonna open up the real pygmy pop so in the real pygmy pop we've got one two three four five six six surprise bags and a stand so we've got six surprises in here and a stand and then in this one we've only got two blind bags so let's start with the real pygmy pop first since there's so many surprises now we're gonna start with one of these small surprises first and then we got this little bitty cute baby blue little character the next one if it looks lush so let's go ahead and open up our flush and then this one is actually a peacock and I was wanting this one really really bad so I'm super excited that we got her so she is blue and she has green and pink feathers and she is super super cute and she smells really good too she smells really really good so let's put her in our pick me pot and then let's grab the other little plushie and then in the other plushie we got a little blue and pink character kind of looks like a bear but then it kind of looks like it has a cow face so I'm guess I'm gonna have to get me checklist to see who she is but she is pink and blue and she's super super cute and she smells really good as well they smell so so good I love the way pygmy pop smell pretty wet and open up this one and then in this one we got an elephant which is super cute and it's a little bitty hangtag or like a pull string and it's a little bitty elephant and she's really really cute so let's light and put her inner pop next tries a surprise is the little bitty nametags some stickers in the checklist so here's our real pygmy pop stickers and then here's our little nametags we got dainty the donkey and glamma the peacock so let's find Stigall mine our picnic cops and then here's our real picnic pop checklist [Music] and there is one more surprise in the real pick me pump and then the last one is some little nail stickers and they're really cute and I cannot wait to try these out so they're super super cute so the real pick me pot cost around $10 so you get all of this in a real pick me pop it's super cute and it smells really really good so let's go ahead and open up our little blind bags and our fake picnic pot so I want to say this one's not a plushie is it squeaks now that is super super funny to me I do not know why but the wrapper said it was going to be a scented plush and when I squished on me it actually started squeaking like a dog toy so I thought that was super funny and I cannot wait to open up this blind bag so let's go ahead and open it up I can hear my dog freaking out on the other side of the door because he wants a little squeaker so bad so let's go and open up and see what it looks like and then she is a squeaker and she too so she's a bunny and she's the keyring so she goes on your keychain I am NOT disappointed with her at all I still think she's super cute and you cannot expect too much from fake toys now if I did accidentally buy a fake thinking it was real then I would be super super upset but I actually knew coming into this that I had fake pick me pops so I cannot expect too much I still think she is very tasty and they do not smell but she is still super super cute so let's set her right here [Music] and then grab our next little surprise out and our next surprise it's a little hangtag so let's go ahead and set it right here and then we're gonna grab our next surprise bag because if they pick me pop and then in our fate we got the stand and then we also got two little bitty characters one is pink and it's a seal and then the other one's blue and it's a bunny and it matches the squeaker so these are super super cute let's stick them in our pygmy pop then a fake pick me pop checklists so here's the fake pick me pop checklist and this is a checklist for season one pick me up and then here's everything that's included in a fake picnic pop so I cannot be too disappointed with the fake pick me pop because it was half price of the real pinkie pop so then I paid $4.99 for the fake pick me pop where I paid $10 for the real pick me pop so you can't be too too disappointed unless you accidentally purchase a fake pick me pop when you're thinking that you're buying a real picnic pop now I came into this knowing I was buying a fake just to show you guys just so you do not accidentally purchased a fake pick me up now I really hope you enjoyed this video please give me a big thumbs up and subscribe to my channel and I'll see you guys in the next video bye guys [Music]", "_Rn5992igxM": "hi guys I am here with a

lame to me now but I still love them don't get me wrong don't get me wrong moving on to the next one another yellow one this is insane this is an untouched case and we somehow I don't feel at once I don't know I don't think it really matters I think it's all completely random with the colour of the lollipop I don't think there's there's a science to that so we have HobNob the hamster ooh how

am get the next one Oh another green one is I guess now we're getting different colors you know we'll see who we got I haven't seen it yet and Cass the squirrel I'm gonna see this on the checklist there you are test the squirrel sounds like watermelon in the comment section mama she even looks a little bit like watermelon you aren't one in a melon oh wow she looks really good oh I love it I wish the tail would have been flushed but I think it looks good oh my gosh I just got like a huge wave of watermelon it smells so good in here my room is smelling like everything it's just great it's just great but I like the little in green ears in the green tail and then you know obviously we have the watermelon eat flesh color of that and then we have a little seeds she's just adorable look at that little squinty face love it great one I love it oh my gosh we're getting down to it you guys this is the next one maybe and I can get it open it open ah nope guess I'm not open than that today this one's top it better get really special I was really hoping it actually maybe see at least ultra rare happen today let's see who we're going to get here we have give them at the guinea pig oh sweet sweet you smell like caramel you're a real squeak hard you know my all my sisters so yeah oh my gosh how cute don't know is that like messed up stitch this is supposed to be like that oh I don't think so I don't know he's a little bit messed up I think but he's so cute otherwise and needless mom oh my gosh wait he doesn't smell like caramel you guys he sounds like bubblegum I think they might have messed up on that one but he's small good so like he's good I really like him he's so cute so this one was just a little bit of a mess up he's a little messed up face and he smells different but he's so wonderful and I love him equally he's adorable so we're on our our last row four more and let's open them up hopefully let's all fingers crossed for our air I would really really like one of those preferably nibble lamb I think that would be the best one yet cute and fuzzy and I'll probably freak out whatever so we got a green capsule and some said that over there and tuku the penguin to give the Penguins an ultra rare but not Bibble it's okay to COO I will love you the same let's go ahead and open here a little thing have an icy or have a nice day blueberry oh my gosh I'm freaking out he's so cute right look at this fuzz oh my gosh he's so great I wish they're all like this but I don't understand that so it makes them ultra rare because there's a fluffy ultra rares but oh my goodness you guys a little think he's so cute I love his extra fuzzy fuzz all my goodness he looks so good oh yeah he's my love blueberry hey don't cute oh my gosh oh I love you this means I would really love Bibble the lamb what if there were two old trams in here that would be fantastic okay next one I think I'm assuming there will only be like what ultra rare per case which is odd because I want bib oh but that's okay I got I got bubble I got tickled I got Tiki all I wanted and I kind of knew I wouldn't get hurt going in so we have a pink capsule and let's put this aside and who do we have we have jujube the giraffe I didn't even see this one checklist either this one apparently smells like caramel he's a common let's go ahead and open it up is you always make me draft hahaha super cute look at this look at this little friend smelly oh okay he's not like caramel it's so funny I'm so I'm just laughing that he doesn't smell like caramel but this one does and he is absolutely adorable I love the giraffe pattern and how they stuck with that so cute definitely doesn't have a long neck that that is okay I like him a lot okay two more you guys only two more I am so sad it's almost over this was such a good opening [Music] forgive a little lamb' never no never so we're just gonna leave it on there everything's falling everything's falling okay we have to be the puppy Toby the puppy where are you on the latest all right there don't give copy so cool and he smells like chocolate let's see who it is you're a total pup star we are we have our little dogie you so cute I've gotten you before so you have a twin oh yeah so much chocolate I inhaled too much so adorable I love Dalmatians so this is amazing I kind of you know according to the artwork I definitely thought he'd be a little more blotchy but you know he's dominating me so he's super cute and super amazing we have one last one you guys and I think we have all the comments at this point so we're either going to get one of the rares for one of them conditions are one of the ultra rares so we're gonna go out and see maybe we'll get one of the Emperor's that was great or maybe we'll get a duplicate I don't know I don't know how they give a pink capsule okay I don't I didn't look at the thing yet let's see pink one put that over there and where is our forgot our checklist and we have okay uh I'm good yes that it's I think I don't know if you can solve it or not but I'm going to guess that it's going to be a rare so they're gonna be squeaks or squirrels I'm gonna say it's gonna be squirrel the caterpillar who she's told like large phalluses you're really wonderful oh my gosh I'm so excited I'm freaking out so here she is you know right now she's super fluffy oh it's just so so good like marshmallows and she has the little four legs but you can barely see you out because there's just a big blob of fuzz oh I love you little bit below oh my goodness oh my goodness you guys opening little full case is really successful we got all of the comments we got almost all of the rare so we're just looking for squeaks and squirrel and we're looking for Pingel the hedgehog and then of course the limited editions which I would actually really like to see and that is really awesome we got quite a few exciting we got all the ones that I wanted let me know your favorite one in the comments below I know you guys are thinking you liked if you are going to pick Bibble the lamb for short but you guys I actually think for my ultimate favorite I'm going to choose bubbles I think she just looks the best

there's so many cute ones but let me know your favorite in the comments below thank you all so much for watching make sure you give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe because I post new videos every single day thanks again and I will see you next time bye [Music] [Music]", "gNWykIf6GSw": "hi and welcome everybody I will be making prison lollipops today so here's what you need to make prison lollipops first of all you'll need the fold top bags or as you know I used to like to call them the baggies these are the ones that just fold join any fold over you look for the sandwich bag you'll need some of these also you will need some q-tips okay and then you will need a bag of Jolly Ranchers or two if you want to make more the other thing you do that we did in prison is that we had a stinger which is a coil that is wrapped on a cord it's like it's a coil and then it plugs into the outlet and you heat up water so what I'm doing is I'm heating up water on the stove because we're gonna have to boil this okay so what you do first of all is I already have another bag of Jolly Ranchers I'm sure you guys wanted to see me hammer out these Jolly Ranchers I'm sure there's another way to crush them but I actually used a hammer and what I did is I open the box and I took them in I kept them in this okay because then I put a piece of plastic down and then I just smashed them inside this so what we're gonna do is once then they're smashed yeah I have already smashed ones over here they don't want to you watch me hammer forever that's horrible so I'm gonna get my baby out okay and I'm going to put well what I like to do too is I'm making two different colors of lollipops I'm gonna make the green ones with the green apple and then I'm going to make the cherry and watermelon together so we're just open them up and put them if I can get it open rights you know in so many ways I made my pajama it's like super hot in my apartment oh and then I made it go everywhere okay so let me pay attention while I'm doing this because this is the obviously notice the second video I did and the very first one I got Jolly Rancher stuff everywhere so this one's gonna be a little bit better I mean I didn't hammer in the bag so that's that's the smart thing so anyways like I said my apartment is like super hot right now we have in this department we have those old-time heaters so you know radiator ones so it's not like I get to change my heat you know what I mean so when it's cold outside they turn on and it's like super duper high you just turn this down yeah so all I'm doing is supporting the Jolly Ranchers I know you guys can't see this they really need to get a better setup um yeah I wouldn't like the picture that's a me and my mom and jab now when Jasmine was a little baby we did the old-time photos in Wisconsin down it's pretty cool it's sad to put something up there you know I think it looks a little bit better okay so see I got all the green ones together okay and I hope that's enough um and what you're gonna do is once it's in the baggy you're just gonna dip it in there because what you're gonna do is mold these what happens is the Jolly Rancher candy starts to melt it's very hot so it starts to melt and you might also want to grab a towel so then you can like instead of burning your hands you can kind of just kind of mush it together see houses like turn to mush but if your pieces are smaller it's a lot faster than lot easier to actually wash together Marsh what a great word um so what I'm doing is see there's a lot of clumps in this one you can see a lot of clumps is not mushing that well so again I'm gonna keep it in here this don't surprise little velvet oh there she comes the queen bee herself what are you doing my little love book something to you okay so I'm doing is trying to mush this so you got for Mom and into anything you want right now it's looking like a big green blob okay and this is great for the kids too they would have a lot of fun doing this you know melting stuff kids love to melt stuff and if you just let it sit in there it should have crushed them a little smaller it was like the smaller pieces when you have the smaller pieces it's so much easier and they're more finer and a lot easier to form yes so oh yeah this is going good now now it's getting smoother so again you can make any shape or whatever you want I'm going to try and make like a heart shape so you just mold it that's what you're doing so I mean right that's pretty cool huh okay so now I'm old with it right now the fun part about this is you got the molding and when it's hot so it does look like a heart right okay so when it's hot I'm gonna put this back in but right now I'm gonna cut my stick so cuz in prison we didn't have anything to make a stick with so we used a q-tip you know and just cut off to the ends of the q-tip like so this will probably go flying someplace I don't want to go but yeah there you go so you got the little stack all right cut another one you know or you can even peel this little q-tip back right here and cut closer again probably gonna go look went flying okay so now I have it one hold it so I'm gonna open this up okay kind of push that together and the thing is what I want to do now is I want to get this part right here the bottom part heated up so I can slip the stick in okay here we go this guy and you don't have to heat up too long but you got to make sure water is boiling and then what I'm gonna do now to make sure I grab my towel I'm gonna put the stick right inside there okay so you get it in there like that like so I don't if you do sticks there see and now I'm going to kind of just see I lost the shape of my heart so I'm gonna kind of mold it around the stick make sure it's covering on all sides and again I left a little bit of shape of my heart okay so now this one's the first one I'm gonna open it up and see what we got okay sometimes they stick to the bag sometimes they don't but usually you can just fill it right off this one's gonna be a little bugger cause he's sticking because it's still worn so kind of lopsided the heart kind of so it's still one it's still more maybe you should just let it uh kind of cool off a little bit more and don't come off I hope it'll come off there we go there there well that heart didn't turn out right it's a little lopsided mmm what happened well I got another one I'm gonna make two so okay so there's the first one in the lower row okay we set this right over here on the bag okay I let them cool off a little bit so then it can come off easier so the next one is gonna be the pink one so I'm gonna make the pink one and again you can mix the colors you can use any colors you want you you know you don't have to use separate colors that is kind of fun you know you can have two different colors or three different colors you know they don't give you much blues in there that kind of sucks on the Jolly Ranchers you know but I like the blues maybe I should mix in a blue with it ones that look cool sure okay so this one think this Easter maybe I'll make this into an egg so again what we're going to do is going to soak this in here and these are a lot of fun to make I mean they are what your joint huh oh yes my little daughter thing mine is a dark no you can't have candy no you can't sweetie no this is one treat you don't care I know no no no mama plum is cooking okay you just behave and don't jump anymore you're not supposed to know yes it wouldn't be a video of velvet embalming right yes okay so let me get on my towel again you're not going up there no no it's not for you not for you honey okay and as you can see what no you know my little darling okay so this one as I said I'm gonna make an egg shape so we're a circle again again you know what it's much easier to melt um if you're you know if they're like not to see how the chunky that is on a fuse and see that it's like really really like chunky in there so you know it's gonna take a while to melt definitely going to melt this a little bit more and I have my stick ready okay now this okay there we go okay Circle Circle look at that I'm gonna get circ okay now when we do here so open this up real quick at the bottom because it's still warm and gooey stick that stick in the middle and then this is the coolest part so what you're gonna do is make sure okay that when you got the stick in the middle and if you can see that stick right there make sure you kind of tuck it in there and smoosh around it because otherwise what's gonna happen is your sticks gonna fall out and you don't want your stick to fall out I'm just saying okay so this one's nice and pretty look at that okay so I'm gonna let this cool for a minute okay if this one cool for a minute well I definitely take a bite of this one and there's real amazing doesn't look like a heart anymore so sorry about that but oh good so this is how you make prison lollipops I hope you enjoyed and please subscribe or you know whatever you guys want to do and I'll be making more videos so you guys can learn all the tricks and trades that we used to do in prison why",

guys in the comments down below thank you all for watching be sure to subscribe to join the chicken coop and I will see you next time bye", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "mZtCqDASxkc": "hey everybody it's me four Rolly here and we are back with episode 2 of cycle 9 in the fmg canopy growing four extracts I am pretty excited about what's going on in here I'll do a quick recap before we kind of dive into a couple new I guess topics or issues or whatever you want to call it as I mentioned we are at date or maybe I didn't but we're at day 10 here in flowers so we're a week later after our last video and you can see that things have stretched quite a bit I'll give you that kind of same shot that I gave you last time where you saw the 24-karat in the back pushing up the scrog net now it's just a complete jungle of everything getting pushed up but we have 15 plants in here actually that's not true look at this I should bring this up since we are recapping and things have changed so we brought out two new plants did a little side plants here we might even bring out one more but we've got a Grape Ape in a Durban poison - excellent strains also two of which are over here so we now have seventeen plants in here but two of them are just going to be basically hand fed from the top as well as the bottom to do a little kind of flood and drain not really flood and drain but top feed and bottom feed I guess just in these trays and you know mother with Coco all the kind of same stuff getting safe at all the same nutrients and yeah two more side plants but two of the same strains which are both contained in this table I'll call this table number four and we'll go backwards this time we've got three Grape Ape and one Durbin poison those are all fairly spotty plants dirt and poison will stretch up a little bit more the grapes are just rolled nice tight nodes stackers take this one right here in the center you can see so I got a nice crown on her and several nice clothes nodes their big fat leaves and we'll definitely have to be Tooting subdue foliated in this room at one point but that's Table one or four sorry that's table for Table three over here is all flow that is one full table flow we are running another table flow with house and garden nutrients so I'm kind of excited to see how the 4v4 turns out they are in different size pots but the smaller ones vegetative wise have bigger pots and the more vegetated veg vegetables but more vegetables in the back RN I believe three gallons of these are in five years over here at this table this is the stretchy table number two we've got this massive 24-karat here in front she stretches like crazy right off the bat as you can see the note spacing is well pretty far to say the least she'll have some nice top columns and everything but she is spread out quite a bit as you can see she's taking up half that table that 4x4 table and she'll get plenty of side lighting from this metal halide that is on a thousand Watts right now back to on that same table also stretching up nicely are the cookies and cream from exotic genetics and those are gonna produce some nice dark purple frosty buds that are quite small compared to some of the other ones in this room but that's kind of expected with those cookie cuts and last but not least table whatever one to whatever this is the last table and this introduction is biochem in the back there and our white cross over here which is the white cross with critical push we've got our chubby bunny up front here and another cookies-and-cream which is just this little guy right here not too crazy on this one I said hello to our little friends ladybugs just kind of hanging out making sure we don't get overrun or really any pests are in here and while we're on that I did want to talk about this last time since it was pulsar the veg period but our pest management really was a regiment of neem oil sprayed probably once every week to two weeks and then we had or no yeah that was like every other week as well as spinosad was every other week so I think those are one week on one week off kind of thing and then we've been using the method one and Method one is just basically a bunch of essential oils smells delicious when you spray it probably tastes good I joked about taking the dab of it but obviously that probably would not be a good idea maybe it I don't know I'm not gonna suggest that I just you know April Fool's haha in any case method one we were using at least weekly that one it's not too harsh on the plants at all neem can be kind of a pain in the butt you really got to make sure you don't spray that with the lights on oh yeah between those three foliar feeds and nematodes and ladybugs we really hit all of our plants hard and veg mostly because there's kind of two critical points where you have to worry about pests I've found at least in our seasonal weather here and that seems to be in the fall right before winter as things are getting cold out they want to find their way indoors and then in spring which is kind of what we're dealing with right now where everything's kind of coming back to life so you really don't want to let your pest management slip at those two times especially and fortunately we're pretty much all but clear on anything in our garden certainly nothing in our flower rooms you know check every plant before you bring it out here but that's not to say that you know things can slip through the cracks well we're staying on top of it and everything is looking pretty darn healthy as you can see here the white balance might be a little bit off just because of this metal halide taking up a little or producing a little bit more light this time than our last video so I may have to correct it again before our next one but yeah they're getting quite a bit of light so we've got the four HPS hoods going and the one metal halide in the center totaling about 56 to 57 hundred watts that's just I believe on 1000 watt mode and these are all on the supermoon lumens or turbo bose smoke mode turbo boost mode which Springs them to about eleven forty watts per bulb or per her let's see so one of the things I'm really excited to share with you guys in terms of the new stuff that's going on is we finally are adding mammoth pee into the garden so we're here at day ten yesterday's feeding at day nine they got their first dose of this if you look at the back of the bottle don't do that let me see if I can focus this in a little bit better so if you look at the back of the bottle for the bloom phase you're looking at starting at about 0.6 milliliters per liter we're sorry milliliters per gallon and hydro going all the way up to 0.6 milliliters per gallon soil is a little bit different soil goes all the way up to 4 milliliters per gallon as you can see and then there's the rest of it with the seedling and clone stage a vegetative stage etc so really they're recommending doing 0.6 milliliters per gallon and hydro systems which is technically what we're running here in our flood and drain systems even though we do have a cocoa medium and I think what my plan is is to bring it from about 0.5 which is the first dosage to 1 milliliter per gallon and then possibly up to a maximum of 1 point 5 milliliters per gallon because we are kind of in a system that's a little bit of both hydro and not really a soil medium it's still cocoa but it's not true hydroponics like the DWC or something like that would be so I think having a nice balance between will work well and like I said they got their first feeding at day 9 and today they got their second feeding at day 10 and I know I can't really judge anything right now I took some photos on their first dates so kind of basically documenting a couple of the colas where they're at right before we get to that really like the integration of the microbes into the plants and them actually utilizing them because within a couple hours I can't imagine they're after being fed I can't imagine they're really utilizing them but this is my first time using it so who else all right I'm gonna go ahead chop the video right now before we get to last couple topics and we'll see you guys again and else by ad 814 I think is what we're working when we're gonna do our lollipop so now let me just chop it real quick we'll be right back alright so like I mentioned our lollipop will be at day 14 I believe I've been stretching it going to like day 21 22 even 23 and Beyond sometimes depending on the plants but I really didn't want to encourage any vertical growth right off the bat so I didn't do any lolli popping at day 0 or 1 like I sometimes do as well and I want to kind of let them start focusing on the frost and blood production as soon as possible without stressing them too far into that so I want to do the lollipop being a little bit earlier on than I've been there's gonna be quite a bit of salad coming out of here I'm definitely gonna leave a lot of this vegetation over here and over here I'm definitely stretching up more on these 24 carrots of course but more or less these kind of back plants will get really kind of their their stems raised or their what's the hope how do they put it like their ears raised or lowered ears lowered man I really butcher that one yeah the plants are getting their ears lowered so in any case lollipop peeing at day 14 for this cycle and last but not least well actually you know there is one more thing I am gonna do some top feeding I think I might have mentioned that but we are going to do top feeding with really let probably a light dose of maybe everything but I really especially want to make sure the pH is right so making sure that soil pH is kind of stabilized with those top feeds but I also be adding those silica and humic products and probably an extra dosage of buds for bat guano I have not yet added that to my reservoirs but I will be after this first kind of Reds change and that will come probably in like two days so again at day ten but at day zero I guess we filled up the rises with our first batch of nutrients I did a top-off around day hold on let me think about this oh that would have been day five or six I think maybe day six so come day like 11 maybe 12 we're gonna have to change the residence so they'll probably get two more feedings out of it and we'll go ahead and change Reza's and that's when we'll start adding but soul back 102 the buzzes themselves the reason I held off initially on that partly because I didn't have it at day one but also it really does those organics and stuff especially the hue makes and Silica's which is why I'm top feeding those organics can really like chunk up your reza's and your pumps and everything you know fortunately I have the capability of using a power washer to clean my rises and my tables the pumps you got to kind of hand clean them with brushes and whatnot but you know if you guys have the capability of running a power washer it really helps cleaning the tables of stuff so you don't have to sit there and hand scrub them which I did for years it really sucks so I'm really fortunate and blessed to have a power washer at this point oh yeah so last but not least I wanted to talk a little bit about our VPD our temps humidity all that kind of stuff where we're where we've been where we're at right now you can see up here our current humidity is 50% and our current temperature is 79 degrees Fahrenheit you see the humidity changing we rocket 41 to 75 in the last 24 hours in relative humidity and 66 degrees to 81 degrees and our temperature difference so it's actually just before I shot this video it got up to 81 it was like 75 but I had to turn off some fans I was messing with some stuff so unfortunately you know that stagnant air for that five minutes or whatever kind of heated things up but the fan the exhaust fan is running right now and we're taking care of some of this heat so that's the temperature and humidity and in terms of our beat VPD chart we're definitely a little off right now so if you want to take like where were ya about 79 degrees and go over we're definitely in that red range I definitely want to be more like in that 65 to 70% humidity which we are getting up to but I'm certain that's nighttime humidity I know the dehumidifier did kick on during this video which I have it set to about 55% so maybe it's a little bit lower on the floor there but I honestly didn't really make sense I feel like heat rises which seems to bring humidity with it so maybe I should turn that down a little bit but again it's you know getting pretty pretty high in humidity at nighttime and if we're dipping into the high 60s at nighttime that makes me a little bit nervous just letting them get too moist and too cool so really I want to be in the like 72 maybe minimum at night and like 77 to 79 in the day you know and then keeping my humidity up so that's kind of where you want to be with the vapor pressure deficit to give these plants the ideal conditions to grow in to provide the best health and to get the most resin out of them and yeah that's pretty important I think so go ahead and check out for girli calm slash VPD you guys can see the chart I just showed you and download it and print it for yourselves I'm gonna go ahead chop it one more time because I don't have the timer display I have no idea for at like maybe five minutes eight minutes or 10 minutes but you know between 10 and 12 we generally get cut out so I'm going to cut it one more time and we'll wrap this video up okay so one more thing before you wrap it up here in net I guess like res top-off I did I forgot to kind of expand on that a little bit more about exactly what I added and we'll just go ahead and check out the new board here so you can kind of see and right here is where we did the top off so we topped it off with I think O's about yeah bout eight to ten gallons Oh 8 to 10 gallons was used so that's about the same of what we had and we brought it back to about 30 gallons maybe not like 32 or so and we added 75 milliliters of cocoa a and B 50 milliliters arise Oh 50 milliliters a boost 50 million milliliters of cal-mag and then I also added our Turpin error so I introduced Turpin ater and it rises we head and added that yet and we added that at 250 milliliters per I think leader that's what they say there's a shoot yeah it's--that's-- I think it's five milliliters per liters so I is what we were certain oh maybe was ten it must be ten milliliters billiard something like that but we're starting off at the low end of the dose and we're gonna bring that up as we go so we'll be isn't quite a bit of turpentine right thing so you can see here we added that 15 milliliters of mammoth pee when we added a mammoth pee and then there's our pH and EC kind of record so you see that mammoth he actually did bring it up a little bit the EC about point two two point three in each res and then our pH we've been trying to keep at five point nine to six point oh but that first feeding was a little bit high and that was just because the drift I'm kind of watching so staying on top of the res is with the pH when we need to and that's been maybe like two or three times a week I'll put a couple drops of either a pH down or we'll really just pH down I think at this point I don't think I've had to put any pH up at in them so that's gonna wrap it up here at day ten in the fmg canopy and the growing for extracts room definitely check me out on instagram at four Rowley I want to pull us up some more photos you can see these ladies are really throwing out some pistols so this is the white cross and and they're ready for flower I think I really do think that bud igniter helped kind of initiate the flowering phase and like I said earlier if you go back and look at some of these grape Apes they really got some crowns already there's another one there's that one we looked at earlier and even over here on this Durbin poison this is like a 10 11 weeks trained really started got some nice nice pistols forming in that bud so that's gonna be it for me check me out at four Rowley calm or your hats and stickers are available in stock currently and will course always be adding more I'm gonna get some shirts soon for you guys I've got some ideas what I want to screen print and I'm pretty excited for those well we'll have those by the cup at the latest pitch which is shoot coming up fairly soon it's less than two months away the

the key to successful candy making at home is having all of your ingredients set out because caramelized sugar waits for no one combine the sugar corn syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat you want to bring the sugar to a boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack stage and then using a pastry brush dipped in water wipe around the sides of the pan to loosen any sugar crystals once the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately submerge the pan in a bowl of ice water and this will stop it from cooking and this is the point when you want to work really quickly because the sugars gonna harden almost instantly pour the sugar into two to three inch circles on your lined baking sheet and then immediately place the lollipop sticks and sprinkles on top and there you have it homemade lollipops just switch up the sprinkles to match your holiday for more recipes and tips check out just to taste calm [Music] you", "ZeGZfTXzYxg":

Queen. Yes. Jailhouse house queen. No, no, no, no, no, no. Good morning my lovelies.\nMy beauties, my friends. My name is Christina and welcome\nto my channel. If you're new here. Thank you so much for\nclicking on this video. I really hope that you will\nsubscribe, stick around, take a chance on hearing some\nthings that I have to say. And if you are a returning subscriber, say y'all already know\ny'all are my babies. So today I am a little excited, a little nervous about this video. Listen, I don't know how this happened you guys, but some video popped up in my suggested\nfeed from this girl and it said jailhouse makeup. So I knew exactly what it was when I\nsaw it and I clicked on it and I have forgotten all about that. How in\nthe world, you know why it was, I only spent six months in the County\njail and the rest of my time was at prison. And that prison, you\ncan buy certain types of makeup. I mean it ain't no Sephora\nor anything girlfriend, but you can buy a couple little things. So I had forgot all about\ncreating jailhouse makeup\nout of things like pencils and Vaseline and coffee. So\nI'm going to recreate it. We're going to go from 2019 Christina\nback to 2005 Christina and I'm going to do my makeup the way I did\nit whenever I was in jail. Now I didn't wear makeup every\nsingle day in there or makeup, whatever you want to call it. Um, but what we would do is if we were\nlike going to court or we, you know, thought we were going to see somebody, we would try to get cute with a little\npencil eyeliner and our coffee on our eyelashes. And the crazy thing is,\nis there's no mirrors in jail. Okay. Or prison. I tried to find one when I\nwent shopping. They have, they look, they literally look like pans\nthat you would cook with, but they have a reflection on them\nenough that you can see yourself, but you can't clearly see herself. So the weird slash scary thing is we\nwould do our makeup and these reflection type issue mirrors that we had.\nAnd then when we would go to court, I would see my actual reflection in like\na window or something and I would be mortified cause I'd be like, I mean whenever I was looking in\nthe mirrors that I couldn't hardly see myself. I look cute and then when I\ncould actually see myself I was like, Oh, so we're going to take\na trip down memory lane. I'm going to leave the girls channel\nlinked in the description box below. So if you want to go\nand check her video out, she did give me this\ninspiration and um, yeah. So I hope you like this video. Please don't forget to like and\nsubscribe. I'm going to ask you now. All right, let's get into it. Okay, so here we are nice and tired looking\nwith all of my bags and I'm good and broke out, which is about how I would look\nif I was in the County jail right now. Now I'm going to show you guys the first\nthing that I would do. Now in there, clearly we didn't have anything like this. We used the sink or the walls. Now I'll tell you that if\nwe got caught doing this, we could get wrote up for contraband. We could get thrown in the hole\ndepending on how the guard feels, so it was always like, you know, you just kind of trying to get away with\nit or if there was a certain guard that came on and you knew you had on makeup, you would try to stay out of their face\nbecause some of them were nasty and they would just go you in the hole\nbecause for contraband. So this is what we would do. Now\ntake the sink and take some powder. Okay. I know it's hard to see because of the\nlight and then some instant coffee. You guys, now the instant coffee\nis dark and it's powdery, so if you mix it with the powder\nand you get the color that you want, you can make a powder for your\nface. It's going to be crazy. I'm going to try my\nbest to mix it together and knowing me, I would\nprobably take something. You try to crunch it, which the commissary is. If\nyour family sends you money. Then once a week you get a paper.\nThis is how it works in jail, it's totally different in prison. But once a week you get a paper and\nyou can Mark on there what you want. And then the commissary, it's usually inmate workers that work\nin the commissary. They bring it to you. So like I said, you can order\npowder, and instant coffee on there. Goodness. So I'm going to get lucky today and\nactually get to use a mirror to do this. But like I said, in the County\njail there, there are no mirrors. It's just a reflection pan. So\nlet's get this powder started. mm. Yeah, Probably gonna stay on my face. Not telling y'all it's going to look good. I'm just telling y'all\nthis is what we did. And like I said, 9 times out of 10 as we would do our\nmakeup on those pans and then we'd go to court and we'd see our reflection in\nlike a real reflection of a window or in the truck, the van that they\nput you in. And then we would, I would personally be mortified, but I also have bad skin. Like I have blemishes and dark\nspots and all that and, and so, okay. Oh my gosh, I'm going to break out. Okay. Then I would take a toothbrush\nand I would comb out my eyebrows. The toothbrushes in there are nowhere. And then I got this from the\ndollar store for a dollar. Okay. The toothbrushes in there are nowhere\nnear as nice as this. So they, the bristles on them are very soft. You\nknow, like when you brush your teeth, you feel like you're basically\nbrushing them with your fingers. And it doesn't matter\nwho you are in there, your breath always stinks because\nthe toothbrushes don't work. So brush out the brows. Okay, now I'm going to make eye shadow. And with the eye shadow we would\ntake deodorant and a magazine. Now you're going to go through the\nmagazine and pick what color you want. What color are we going to do\ntoday, lady? Let's do blue. Okay. So you're going to take the deodorant\nand rub it really good on the color that you want. You can see it's already\ncoming off on the deodorant. Now I'm going to take my finger and just get some of that color. See the blue on my fingernail, see all the blue on the deodorant. Gonna take that off and put it on my eyes. And if you have nails\non when you go in there, they make you take them off and if you're\nlike acrylic and you can't take them off, they make you cut them off. Certain types of\nhairstyles, like you know, if girls had like braids in their hair\nand stuff or if they had a wig on, well if they had braids in their hair,\nthey couldn't really get them all out. But if you had a wig on, like glued in\nor whatever, they make you take it out. So sometimes girls in there, they're looking crazy because they just\nhad to like remove their wig or their hair extensions without the proper\nstuff that they need to remove it with. And then their hair is damaged. Now for eyeliner. I still cannot believe that we did this\nbecause I don't know how lead poisoning works with being that close to your eye,\nbut we would take a little Vaseline. Now you cannot buy\nVaseline on the commissary. You actually have to get it from the\nnurses station and tell them that it's for your lips and we clearly\ndidn't have these plates, but we had cement walls so we would put\nthe Vaseline on the cement walls and then we would take a pencil because we\nweren't allowed pens and you're going to make a dark colored paste with the pencil. See the dark colored paste that we can\nuse for like a liquid eyeliner now you guys. Listen, if you don't try this at\nhome, but if you do DM, me a picture on the gram, Oh, I've never really been good\nat winged eyeliner anyways, How are we looking? All right, now I'm going to fill in my eyebrows. This is literally how I looked in\njail, all washed out like this, like pale and sickly looking. This\nis literally how I looked in jail. Now I'm going to do a little blush\nbecause we need to add a little bit of, you know, color to this face. So I'm going to find a pink or red and\nit needs to be somewhat dark because it's not going to show up very good anyways. Ooh, that looks like a pretty color blush. You guys this pencil's burning my\neyeball and I remember it burning my eye whenever I was in jail too. There's our blush. Oh, she fancy. I mean, yeah, that totally did it. Let's\ndo a little bit more. All right guys, now that you have on\nyour base, your blush, your eyeliner, your\neyeshadow, and your eyebrows. Now we're going to do\nlashes. So for lashes, we're going to use coffee again and a\nlittle bit of water and I'm going to use the bottom of this. I'm going to\ndo it just like I would do in jail and make this paste for you. How I would do it in jail was I would\ntake a toothbrush with the paste on there. Oh God bless guys. And do my lashes. And like I said before, I thought I was cute in those mirrors\nuntil I saw a real reflection of myself and I was like, Oh no. Why not just color these brows\na little bit more for funsies. Oh yes, yes. Queen. Yes. Jailhouse queen. All right. And just like any good makeup, we are going to finish it\noff with a little lipstick. Okay. Typically I would use Kool-Aid\nor something like that in\norder to make lipstick. But because your girl didn't have any\nmoney for commissary and I don't have any lipstick, I'm going to use a Dorito.\nDoritos will stain your fingers, but they will also stain\nyour lips. Okay, so we're going to, Oh God bless. Gross. That's disgusting. Y'all know they were throwing me in\nthe hole, honey, if they caught me if I haven't told you this enough\ntimes here, the mirrors there. You can't hardly see yourself. Right?\nSo you think you're looking cute. Okay. And if you don't leave for\ncourt, like if you're just in there, then you don't really get to see\nyourself. You're looking at a reflection. It's like looking through beer\ngoggles all the time and your like Oh, I am so cute, girl. Oh, I am so cute. No, no, no, no, no. All right y'all. That is it for\nyour jailhouse tutorial for the day. I know this video was\nabsolutely ridiculous. Let me know what you think in\nthe comment section down below. I know some of y'all have been to jail. Let me know if y'all saw girls\ndoing this or if you did do this, let me know if you think my eyes are gonna\nfall out of my head from putting this in my eyes. Is my face going\nto break out? All right y'all. Please don't forget to like this video. It is a free way that you can help\nme out. I love you guys so, so much, and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.", "yU6dn0ogi3c": "hey everybody it's me freely here and we are back for another episode of their cycle 9 series this time it is episode 3 at day 16 and we're back in that femme G canopy with our growing 4 extracts room everything is looking very luscious and fallen here and I'm very excited at how this is going I think on ma yeah I guess last week's roundtable I predicted that this will be my best gram per watt run probably in the history of my growing career and you know that's a pretty pretty big prediction to make especially this early on but I'm pretty confident at this point and assuming all things go well and we continue to move like we are well I'm pretty excited that we're definitely gonna crush it in here as you can see we've actually actually added a third Center plant here so we've added one more Durbin poison and then again we've already got a Durbin point Durbin poison and Grape Ape that we've already added in here at approximately day six and then at day 13 I believe or an all day 14 we added this one so those are about a week behind the rest and these are about a week behind that and that one is about a week behind those I should say but yeah we are truckin very long and we're pretty close to max capacity and you can probably throw one more in there but I think we'll probably just end up with those three so with the addition of those three plants we are now up to 18 plants in this room with the total of I believe 8 strains right let's see 2 4 6 hey yeah I believe we have eight streets but yeah 50 put our 18 plants we started off with 15 we are at day 16 and as you probably noticed already at this point we have not yet lollipop I know I mentioned doing that at day 14 but unfortunately I had to take off out of town for the last couple days so I kind of missed that and was really rushing to make that happen in the first place so you know I'm fortunate IDing at the lollipop being done at day 14 we are going to do it today probably in the middle of this video and but the reason for that the reason I didn't get to the lollipop being is other than having to go out of town is I did the rest change and with res changes not only do you have to pull these out what I do is I disconnect the two hoses and then I disconnect my two pumps so my recirculating pump and my flood pump and then I pull up my air stone and then I remove everything out and I clean it off and that's a mix of like power washing hand scrubbing soapy water not no bleach or any other chemicals just regular dish soap at this point and tap water so that's how I'm cleaning these roses it takes quite some time just to maneuver everything that's that's a you know task in and of itself but you know scrubbing them down power washing them all and everything you just you know you gotta get it done and it's really they contribute to the overall health of the plants and I guess we can take a look at the res change what we did here so you can kind of see where we're at with our feed chart talked about the first res chains and kind of topping it off and then adding some mammoth pee that was our last videos at adding the Matt Pete so our pH and the last res this current res I should say was 5.8 as I like that's where I left it off at the EC is 1.8 and of course is rest change number to put in about 35 gallons this time whereas before we were like 32 32 and then here's what we added - the Reza's themselves so this is not per litre or per gallon or anything like that I will note it if it is but this is per res so this is per 35 gallons so we did 300 milliliters of cocoa a and B from Kenna nutrients also for Kennan nutrients we use 175 milliliters or isotonic 200 milliliters of boost and 250 ml of years little leaders of Kenna's I'm so I did get the cat as I'm finally in here we were using senses I'm in the past I also upped a little bit cal-mag to 150 milliliters and then Turpin hitter was added as you can see as well as putts well and those are both added at 400 milliliters which is around like 5 milliliters per liter so per gallon I think yeah 500 liters per gallon other and then mammoth pee we put in 35 milliliters so 1 milliliter per gallon so with mammoth pee we're up to one milliliter per gallon blood cell bat guano interpreter we're just dumping quite a bit in there that's probably the max amount of butts while I will use but Turpin ater I may even increase up to 500 milliliters because it says you can go up to 30 milliliters per gallon and let's say we have a full 40 gallon rez what is that like 700 milliliters or something so that's quite a bit especially in each Reds you're looking at using like 3 litres almost per feeding or per about 10 days maybe maybe about 14 days if we went 40 gallons with it but that's a lot it's kind of a big expense and while I may be maybe 30 milliliters isn't necessary but you definitely see the benefit from adding 10 and I'm trying to increase it a little bit more so let's take a look at these grapes real quick and see we have a little sideshow going on here just a little action you know what I'm saying feeling the love in the garden today these great babes are looking fantastic I just posted a picture of these on Instagram and man they're just stacked very nicely some real fat nice crowns and the flower mode is is really like going hard right now take a look at this Durbin poison you can see she's already got the big fat crowns out now too we look back at the flow table that's also doing the same thing and she's also nice and stacked that's that whole tables all flow so that's gonna be a nice thick canopy you can kind of see not only the intensity of this hood like we talked about in Episode one but no it's spectrum difference too you know granted this is all white balance and stuff but it's interesting to see that on video and of course this table we got our big stretches of 24-karat in the back and the cookies and cream now I thought about throwing that second strong that on there and I think at this point I'm gonna decide I'm not going to do that I certainly still could and if I have to yo-yo anything it'll probably only be like maybe maybe up to a dozen but I wouldn't even expect that many like colas over there that I'm gonna have to yo-yo so I'm not too worried about that but if the time comes we can we can do that I'm just gonna let them go right now and I'm liking what I see over here they're just stretching for this metal halide light lean in with it and rocks it way that you can see the the leaves turning kind of facing this way rather than facing up they almost have like a nice little like Benton to them so they're like facing over here and up towards the HPS yeah they're definitely loving it all this all that right there that's gonna be real fat plump buds basically top colas you know any mean but way down the branch foot foot and half down the branch that side lighting is gonna help quite a bit and of course you know side plants are nice if you have the plant out in the room but if you actually have side lighting over the side plants they're basically not even side plants at that point you just got to manually feed them just kind of a pain in the butt because you know I set it up for flood grain so I don't have to do that but you know we're getting quite a bit of a benefit out of these two turbine poisons a great babe on the side so a little extra effort is certainly worth it let's take a look at the temperatures real quick we are slowly rising and it was 77 degrees when we started I I turn off when we do these videos I turn off this exhaust fan I guess it's more of an intake fan over here but that's blowing cool air in from the other room so we're not getting that cool air while I shoot these videos and that's why the temperature does usually rise a few degrees but it was 64 to 77 degrees max in the last 24 hours and you can see that forty seven degree or forty seven percent humidity up to 85% humidity and that's just because this morning our dehumidifier got full and you know it's probably a couple hours before I got to dump it so I just did that now we're back down to that 58% she slowly crap prepped from about 65 or so to that 58 since we started this video or maybe since I started working here I should say I'm gonna go ahead and have a couple sips of my morning coffee here and then I'm gonna get to foliated we got a lot of work to do in here there's gonna be probably at least one bucket full of plants or of leaf material coming out of here certainly could throw those in some smoothies or something like that but I don't think I'll be utilizing them necessarily and maybe miss a girl will be dumb for making a massive smoothie or something but shoot it should just make some salad for lunch how about that oh yeah as you can see there's a lot a lot a lot a lot and someone didn't mention they're like well you know why are you deflating if you're growing or why you lolli popping if you're growing for extracts because you know it might be like lar fee like kind of popcorn e buds down here but they're sort of produce trichomes right yeah absolutely right that's you know it's a good point but I'm not doing a super-high lollipop I think I mention that before normally I'd go like almost all the way up to the scribe net here but I'm really only gonna do like a 15 of maybe 25% and I'm not doing it on these plants I'm just doing it out of the plants they're really just not gonna use the that material at all and it's not gonna get any light it's eventually going to die off so if we have leaves material like you can see already here if we have leaf material dying off that's only going to contribute problems to the plant so I think for the overall health of the plant and the overall efficiency of the plant I think it's a wise idea to do some some defoliating and or lollipop being regardless unless you're just you know that quick and veg and have that small of plants that you know there's no reason to but what I'm doing here even though are we are growing technically for extracts I think it's gonna be a wise idea to take at least 15 to 25% of basically these back rows you know each side that aren't getting a lot of lighting [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys we are back here I am done lolly popping I did a bit of defoliating as well as you saw I didn't take off quite too much but I I did just take off I think just enough to give it a little bit of boost in terms of penetration now I certainly can't get back to like some of this in here so that's pretty much just gonna stay as is but a lot of the kind of central part of the tables and then along the sides here I D foliated just to allow the penetration to get in as well I also cut my thumb pretty good with the scissors and yeah that's always fun don't have too many injuries in the garden to be honest if anything is just gonna be me tripping over stuff or bumping my head on things but those scissors will get you from time to time so let's go ahead and take a look at the undercarriage if you will you definitely see quite the difference here you see on these back ones I took them up a little bit higher than I did on the front and you know I got some of these branches kind of hanging down and the sides in the centre and just you know allowing them to kind of find their space so a couple home might come off still throughout the next week or so but we're pretty much gonna leave what we have on at this point let me go ahead and take a brief step over this table you can see as well quite a bit taken out it's pretty difficult to get back to the especially those flows in the back there but you're really gonna kind of maneuver and just lean into these tables you almost need someone to like be there to hold your belt or something but I'll go ahead and walk you down the tables as well I kind of see there's there's quite a bit here still in terms of foliage I did take up a little bit on the sides here but most of it is still there you can see a lot of a lot of side branching and stuff coming through so there's still plenty of foliage a lot of node sites and this light will be blowing out everything here so it's metal-halide is probably going to be I don't know how to describe it but the best test results I've gotten have been when I run a metal metal halide pretty much throughout the entire flowering cycle not just the last two weeks now of course you know more photons more light that's always a good thing as long as you can keep the environment in check but I think it's you know it's certainly a spectrum thing too so I'm gonna go ahead and move these side plants back here and call it a day I appreciate you guys watching definitely check me out at for girly calm I've got hats and stickers on there plus my feed charts my vapor pressure deficit chart right here that's on there you guys can download print it off throw it in your garden hang it up do whatever you got to do with it maybe save it on your phone or just pull up a website for reference if you're just kind of working in the garden what else Instagram check me out an Instagram you follow me at for Olli lots of bhl kind of related stuff on there I've done a whole lot of BHO videos lately but I've kind of covered everything in terms of especially the equipment I have so I think there's maybe one or two videos I want to kind of complete that series out with but we'll be getting on to rosin pressing here soon and that'll be of course available here on the YouTube channel and maybe parts of it on the Instagram as well but subscribe if you haven't already give it a thumbs up because I can't there's no bending of this thumb right now just got the biggest band neck band aid I could get but thumbs are up throw a comment down below and until probably like maybe we'll get one in around day 21 and try to get back on that like weekly schedule that's seven days schedule but if not you know we'll be in the next five to seven days probably have another update ready for you guys so I guess that's going to be it until next time good luck and grow big", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more reviews and if you've tried wild please leave a comment below and tell me what you thought about them again guys my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will see you guys next time you", "WrYwIhzUods": "hi I'm dr. blue wolf and today we're gonna be talking about how to learn the basic metabolic panel or the chem 7 and under two minutes let's get started first up is sodium so since it's the first one on our list of ranges and limits let's think about the character limit for Twitter or at least the old character limit the old character limit was 140 characters so roughly it's about 140 millions per liter of sodium so the range is 135 from 145 next up is potassium and if you looked on the periodic table of elements its abbreviate as the letter K so if you make the okay sign then okay you're holding up the number three the circle kind of looks like in a dot or a decimal point and then open it up 5 so 3 point 5 2 5 milli equivalents per liter and now you know potassium next up is chloride or chlorine chlorine always makes me think of swimming pools you want to go swimming when it's a nice hot day 95 to 105 degrees so just remember chloride 95 to 105 millions per liter next up is bicarbonate the prefix bi means two so this is all about the twos 22 to 32 you got that be UN or blood urea nitrogen do you agree mind you don't touch it girls buns went under 18 years old because under 18 milligrams per deciliter is the normal lab value hey hey hey hey we're talking about a girl's bun on her head get your mind out of the gutter cranny is the normal breakdown of muscle tissue so when you go to the gym and you're trying to do your reps you try to usually do about 6 to 12 so remember 0.6 through 1.2 12 lastly we have glucose just think of it this way if you pass the test you get a lollipop okay sugar they say C's get degrees right so 70 to 100 percent would be passing so 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter is the normal range for glucose so there it is there you have it I hope it was hope for you for me it was helpful to know the general reference range for these labs so if we quickly decide what was normal what was not normal I was about questioned on it while rotating through the hospital almost every place I went just know that every lab has slightly different normal values so as long as you know the general reference range or you know you have a set that you can remember in your mind I think you should be okay let me know what you think good luck studying", "9SKrai-jQeY": "hi everyone welcome to the September headset data analytics webinar I see that people are starting to virtually file into the room I'll be back with you in one minute to give up another one-minute warning and we'll jump in and get started hi everyone welcome again to the headset edibles and beverage market insights webinar C people are still filing into the room we will get started in about one minute hi everyone I'm Steve from the customer success team here at headset it's my pleasure to welcome you to another in our series of webinars about the adult use cannabis industry today's topic is a yummy one will be discussing discussing beverages and edibles and we'll jump in shortly please be reminded to post your questions in the questions section in the zoom and we'll handle as many as we can at the end and first of all just a little bit about headset our mission here is to help businesses easily understand the cannabis industry through data analytics and market intelligence enabling them to make better informed decisions unlocking success and pushing the industry forward and whether you are retailer trying to eliminate guesswork about inventory or a vendor trying to avoid stock outs and streamline distribution or a business trying to understand trends and opportunities the headset team will be there to assist you and here to assist me today and our presentation is my colleague and mentor and all things data Liz Conners welcome Liz thanks for having me Steve tell me one thing about how you're accomplished in French pastry yeah well I was a pastry school a few years ago not really related to analytics but just so that I could bake for co-workers to get more favors though I did spectacular leaf flop a cake today so not not bring it in well they're over there why don't you jump in and take it away I know you've got a lot to cover yeah absolutely so hi everybody I'm happy to be here today like Steve said I'm our director of analytics here at headset and today I'm going to take you through what is mostly an audible and beverage webinar we've done to market reports we did one back in August where we focused on the beverages market and we did one that was released I think it was just this week maybe last week sees on the edibles market it's very fresh yeah absolutely just like out and you know you like your animals super fresh for sure so that's the freshness of the reports but so we're going to examine some of the insights from those but actually did quite a bit deeper and see if we can get an idea of the landscape of both of these markets but before we do that a lot of people in these webinars are sometimes new to the cannabis market entirely they don't know much about the market or what data we're looking at so first I'm just going to go through the total market size in some of the adult u states and we're going to have a brief Canadian interlude where we talk just a bit about Canada not a lot just a little bit just enough to whet your appetite for the edibles have I used too many audible puns already no keep going excellent all right so without further ado let's look at some of had such insights market data with just a little bit of adieu first let me tell you about the data that we have here at headset so I want to give everyone an introduction to how we collect our data our insights data is transactional data it is not from survey it comes from point-of-sale systems from consumers when they make purchases at the register our insights data product offers market level trends to help businesses better understand the competitive landscape of a recreational cannabis market insight specifically focuses on helping business businesses make data-driven decisions related to product innovation pricing and demand planning to create our insights market data we start with data collected from our participating retailers point-of-sale system currently there are over 700 retailers connected to the headset retailer platform and that number grows every day it has set we protect the privacy of our retailers and our first step to do that is we aggregate anonymized and normalize the data of our retailers only retailers have access to their own data via the retailer platform the rest of the data it goes through an anonymizing process from their machine learning algorithm step in to help us normalize the disparate products in each retailers catalog as you know Steve there's no UPC's right now in cannabis so it can be very difficult to relate products to one another our first step is to have robots help us in that process go robot excellent yeah so after the robots are done we have some human data entry specialists that go through and categorize the product and assign metadata including the product traits these are things like what segments perhaps it's the amount of milligrams at each seeing the product perhaps it's the strain of the marijuana that's in the product so they assign a lot of product data for us finally we take all of that data and we cleanse it to reduce noise and skew this involves a lot of inferential statistics which I can't see people in person but I imagine their eyes would glaze over so I go to much deeper than that all all I'll say is those methods their help to take our sample and forecast it out to the total population and finally we take those sales and put them in our insights platform so that people can take that information and make business decisions just like the ones we're going to look at today alright so before we get started let's look at the total adult use market in a few of the adult you States this isn't all of them but some of the larger one so they're in the last we see California which is the largest market coming in it at over 200 million dollars for the month of August these numbers that you're looking at are for the month of August and less noted down there at the bottom of my footnote for Washington just under a hundred million dollars Nevada is about half that five at sixty million so Washington about half the size of California Nevada about half the size of Washington and finally Colorado is coming in order around 130 million these states are are for inside states you know the ones we're primarily going to look at today but I do want to call out that there is the Oregon market which is about 60 million dollars of adult use sales and Massachusetts which is growing and I think in June I believe both organ and Massachusetts and Canada here Jim numbers they were about 45 million dollars of sales and finally I have some Canadian information in here so the Canadian market is for all of Canada was it about 60 million dollars that's been converted to USD in July so still small but definitely growing let's dive in and look at these four insight states a little bit more so here what we're looking at is August sales year-over-year so this year like I said August rang in for these four states at just over a half billion dollars for the month compared to last year that is about 34 percent year-over-year growth so it's still a very healthy market growth there Oh prior year 2017 or 2018 there was even more growth but a lot of that was the California market coming into play the California legalized adult use in the beginning of 2018 when we look at that growth from 2018 to 2019 what's remarkable to me about that Steve is the fact that that came without the addition of a new state when we're looking at just this data so that 34 percent growth is organic growth within the state now let's quickly look at Canada for those of you that didn't pay attention in your Canadian geography classes there are 12 provinces in Canada the largest of which is Ontario which contains Toronto the second largest is Quebec as alluded to by population size that our largest they are also the two by cannabis sales that are the largest as well so you can see those down there at the bottom for all of Canada in June of 2019 sales ring in at 91 million dollars that is Canadian so if we convert that to us to compare for us market size that's about 70 million I want to specifically call out Alberta there though Alberta had about 18 million dollars in sales in June Alberta is one of the provinces that is the only province in Canada that we offer insights in Steve so we have the four states from the US California Colorado Washington and Nevada but we now also have Canadian insights starting with the province of Alberta that's relatively new I think we launched that within the last month or so they're still super new insights but I wanted to point them out so as we think about Canada let's look at some of the month over month growth so when we compare the month of June to the month of May we see that in total Canada grew about 6% with Quebec and Ontario taking a little bit faster than average growth rate and Alberta's in there right around 5% what I want to point out about these numbers is these are month over month growth numbers so if we took that number and forecasted it out to be what would the year growth be we would see sales almost double within a year if that growth rate continued so it's growing a lot faster even than our US States for sure we hear a headset are really expecting to see Alberta grow over the late summer and early fall because they've been issuing a whole lot of retail license I believe in June there were fewer than 200 retail licenses and as of today 279 has been issued so we'll probably see a lot of retail traction pick up there in the next few months but let's head back to the US everybody grab your passports means back to the US and here in the US for our four inside states what we're looking at is a breakdown of the category sales in August so the first thing I want to point out is the bright green square that is flower sales a headset we take the total sales and break them down by format or category and we have nine major categories flower is the largest category though I do want to note that flower has lost its majority market share so Steve flower is ringing in now at only like 43 percent I think of total sales down from well over 50% just a year or two ago paper/pencil in our next largest segment and that is a little bit more than half the size of flower and surround our are in Haleyville segments we also have concentrates and pre-rolls so you can see concentrates there in a navy blue at about 38 million and pre-rolls just a bit larger than concentrates at 45 but today what we're going to focus on instead of the inhalable is the non inhalable so non inhalable czar seventeen percent of the total market with the largest category being edible coming in at sixty million dollars last month we also see tinctures and sublinguals topicals beverages and capsules that's what makes up our non inhalable market today we're going to focus just on the edibles and beverages so these were 65 million dollars of sales in August annualized Steve that would be just over three quarters of a billion dollars in those four states alone those four states wouldn't just edibles and beverages mm-hmm yeah sixty-five million a month works out to just just over three-quarters of a billion these are very very large markets for sure in fact they make up such a substantial portion that were really excited for when Canada begins allowing these formats in the coming months so right now grab your passport will hop back to Canada yeah absolutely here's the sales mix mal Berta as it stands over the last three months so we see flour being very dominating for sure and pre-rolls taking up out the rest of that space a lot of this is because beverages out of bowls and favorite pens those really large segments that we were looking at before are not yet legal in Canada so they will be soon and so we're really excited to see those come into the pie and make this pie a much bigger piece I would probably have to get a bigger screen for your computers for us to see it alright so now that we talked just a little bit about all of the categories let's go ahead and dive into our edibles and beverages so in the four states that we have insights in in the u.s. like I said we have about 65 million dollars of sales in August this is from a very rapid growth over the last few years the one thing I want to note we see a really big uptick there Steve at the beginning of January 2018 that's the California recreational market coming into play we also see some peaks and valleys here a little bit of that is due to some months having more days than others but a portion of it is due to seasonality in the data both edibles and beverages tend to be a little bit seasonal if we look at this growth what we'll see compared to last year so this do you remember we had beverages coming in at around 5 million dollars that's a 22 percent growth over last year an audible today's 35 percent growth over last year so super quick growth rates there absolutely but as things grow what we wonder is do they grow outside of the rest of the market so our edibles growing faster than everybody else especially those in Haleyville segments remember I said flower was losing its market share so it must be going to someone so if we go and look at market share what we see is the edibles increase their market share since 2017 so in 2017 in July a table for making up about nine point four percent of the market today that stands at just under 11 percent so because that market share increased what we know is that edibles are growing faster than other categories beverages are relatively flat we see about a 1% 1.1 percent market share in July of 2017 over to 1% today so we're going to dig into that trend a little bit more and diagnose it it sounds like all the sales are flat that's maybe not that great of a thing but when we look at it we'll actually see some healthy growth underneath that market share change it also sounds like a pun if you say it does yeah yeah beverages are flat no one likes flat beverages I'm gonna try to make them not flat here in a bit okay so if we go through and look at market share remember just a while ago we talked about the non inhalable products they were about 17% of the market in both July and August of this year but they were comprised of five categories so when we think about the categories we're talking about today of those non inhalable products these two categories make up between two-thirds and three-quarters of that marketplace it does vary a bit by state with California having a slightly lesser share to these these two categories a lot of that's because temperatures are quite popular in California and with Colorado Nevada having a bit of a larger market share I do want to point out Washington where we see a bit more beverages than other places and we'll come back to that in a while so let's begin two beverages on their own so we're going to do a set here on beverages and we'll hop over and do a set on edibles and really get an understanding of these markets and what they're made up of so the first thing I want to talk about is the pricing and the market size for that matter so remember I said Colorado had a much bigger portion of their sales going to beverages so does Washington we knew from our very first slide that Washington is about half the size of California in terms of recreational marijuana sales however they actually have more beverage sales in California that was a really interesting finding to me with Colorado having the most sales of all so that really shows you how the difference in market share can play out across the different states the other thing I'd like to talk about here is the average item price so average item price is the average amount you would pay for a given product in the marketplace and while we see that there is some variation with the most expensive beverages being in Nevada and the least expensive being in Washington those are all the blue numbers that you see along the along that graph this actually isn't a lot of price dispersion we use a see prices be very different across the market for beverages we I see them be relatively close to each other this is an interesting finding for me as well these prices are going to raise an eyebrow Liz so we should probably mention taxes and discounts here yeah absolutely so when we talk about prices here at headset we give the price after the discount the discounting is common I personally my favorite is the industry discount but there's a lot of discounting that can take place especially when there are promotional days or we see a lot of discounting on 4/20 for instance Green Wednesday these numbers are after discounts as it relates to taxes these numbers are exclusive of taxes played paid explicitly by the consumer so for instance as always sales tax when you think about the receipt you get when you purchase something you'll see the total amount of the product and then the sales tax will be called out right there in some states I believe Washington is one of them the excise tax was also explicitly paid by the consumer in other states excise taxes paid before it ever gets to the consumer and is built into the prices so that would be common in California I believe and so these prices are should be the prices that the consumer would be expect to be paying before they pay any of the sales taxes thanks yeah worried all right so moving on let's look at that market share remember I saluted the beverages where it had a relatively flat market share but let's break that down by state and see if we can figure out why that trend exists so here what we're looking at is the market share of beverages in 2017 hovering right around one percent in most states in 2018 all states saw increases in market share for beverages and we see the introduction of California with a market share of 0.6 so this is actually one of the reasons we see the market share remaining stable it's growing in states that had had beverages but when California entered the market it was a little bit of a lesser market share and so that's actually what makes the trend look flat because again if we have 2019 here what we see is sort of flat there in Colorado definite growths in Washington a little bit of a contraction in Nevada and some growth in California so really when we break these down by stage is going to get the better idea of how the trends are occurring now that we know a bit about market share what I want to dig into as we're trying to wrap our brain around what cannabis beverages are is what that category is composed of so here it has set we break every category down into segments or subcategories in the beverages category we have four segments I'm sorry a six segments with one of them being others a little bit of a capsule there but primarily we see it being dominated by carbonated beverages so as you're looking at this graph everybody the bar at the very top that's the first quarter of 2018 and we go quarter by quarter until we get down there at the bottom to q3 of 2019 which is a partial quarter but we see carbonated beverages being the leader and kind of retaining that we see drops mixes and elixirs relatively maintaining their market share the one I want to call out is the teal one that is the mocktail segment that's the one that we have really seen a lot of growth in lately and we're going to dig into those just a little bit more and try to understand where it's coming from but just like we did with market share it's always important to look state-by-state when you have these aggregated numbers because what we'll find is the each state is quite different so here what we're looking at is the market share by segments across the state this is what's currently true today in Washington we see about 80% of our beverage sales going to carbonated beverages we're very heavily dominated by carbonated beverages that's very different from Nevada in Nevada the most common beverage segment is iced tea lemonade and fruit imagine up fruit drinks not fruits now I think this makes sense when we stereotypically think about the states there's not a lot of months for us here in Washington to kick back in the sunshine and enjoy those iced teas and lemonade's but in Nevada where it is usually warm usually sunny if perhaps there's a bit more space for that in addition in Nevada we see mocktails being a very important segment it is the second largest tech and again I think this probably plays into a lot of the market in Nevada so a lot of the market Nevada is around Las Vegas and as people come it's a really nice tourist option it looks like something you're used to not everybody wants to purchase in Haleyville to take back to their hotel room nobody wants that smoking fine so those mocktail beverages do seek a bit of growth there colorado is different still here we see that drops mixes elixirs and syrups are the majority of the market this is a lot of this is small packages of dissolvable powders in fact they're mostly unflavored powders that you pour into your own beverage so BYO liquid and then you have that powder of the THC to mix in there and you can mix it into anything you like it also makes the most common flavor in Colorado be unflavored which is interesting to me yeah most common flavor is none and then finally if we looked at California what we see is the carbonated beverages dominate that space but again pretty healthy market share therefore mocktail and the thing to me that stands out a lot about California is the tea coffee and hot cocoa segment which is about a quarter of the market a lot of that is Kiko cookies in that space all right so moving on that's one way that we break down categories here at headset is by segment the other way that we break down categories is by their package size and when we talk about package size here headset what we're talking about is the milligrams of THC in the package not the fluid weight not the ounces we care about the good stuff so what we care about is that THC so here what we're looking at is by state the unit volume by the amount of THC in the package so the first thing I want us all to note is that dark maroon bit of the graph that it looks like it's a majority in every state those are 100 milligram packages so very large package sizes there the next thing I want to point out is that in Nevada we see a whole lot of 0 to 5 milligram package sizes these are more single serve beverages they're things that maybe you'd grab a couple of them at once they're also our Hevy CBD to THC so there's a whole lot of CBD in it just a little bit of THC those are quite common in Nevada as well in Washington we see a lot of 10 milligrams a decent amount of 30 milligram but really again we're still dominated by this 100 milligram packages California again a little bit more dispersed there where we're looking at everything from maybe the smaller single serves all the way up into the big packages and then finally Colorado Colorado has the largest share to these hundred milligram packages and that trends really interested me so what we're going to do for the rest of the section on beverages is dig into the 100 milligram package size in Colorado I was just interested are people in Colorado do they have really high tolerance is that what it is or could it be something else going on you said Mountain there it is yes yeah really increases your your tolerance to THC I don't know that that's true please don't use that you won't have a good time but let's dig into that and see what those are composed of so what you're looking at here is a landscape a product landscape chart on the Left we have the milligrams of THC in the product so that's that y-axis there at the bottom or on the x-axis we have the segment's and then the chart is populated with the total unit sales in the last 90 days and it's colored by the amount of unit sales so it's kind of like a heat map the first thing I want to point out is anywhere that you see white or no number no beverage no beverages exist in that space so for instance there are no iced tea lemonade and fruit drinks in the 0 to 5 milligram segment in Colorado at least the vanilla so what I want to point out is the biggest thing remember we're talking about these 100 milligram package sizes that's very dominated by the drop makes those elixirs and syrups and actually what that is is a whole lot of hundred milligram packages that have either 10 or 20 individual serve powders to mix into your drinks the other thing that we noticed was really large in Colorado was the 10 milligram segment and here that's primarily dominated by carbonated drinks these are sodas with with 10 milligrams in them so those are kind of the big players we also have in ice tea lemonade and fruit drinks a lot of 200 packages but anytime you're looking at the landscape to me what I always wonder is this is what's true today but what was true before and I think that's one of the places where there's a lot of opportunity to really understand how the markets are shifting these markets shift very fast sometimes you can see big shifts with it within even a 30 or 60 day date range so I'm going to compare it to last year because there have been some very major shifts since last year so to do that same graph there on the left is the graph you were just looking at so that's this year and then we're looking at the same time period last year they're on the right still in Colorado still in Colorado yep still in beverages and what I want to do is point out how different things are so transformation Tuesday here on mocktails for sure there were very little of them last year absolutely not a lot but this year what we see is those are really coming into play so we see a lot of small package sizes there Steve up at the top you see 3,600 units sold in that 0 to 5 milligrams I there's also some in that 100 milligram segment but this is one where this is a segment that's growing quick and we can see sort of what types of beverages are making up that space as we try to decide whether that's an opportunity for us to do some product innervation not you and me us our customers up or whether it's the face that we should be concerned about the hard thing that caught my eyes straight away was that last year the most common type of beverage you would purchase at a unit level is a 10 milligram carbonated beverage this year it is a 100 milligram it's actually a hundred milligrams drops mixers elixirs and syrups so the most common segment has shifted that's always something to keep an eye on when we see someone kind of fall from the top and someone new come in and take their place the other thing I want to point out is that last year in this drops mixes and elixirs and syrup segments that really weren't very many units sold in the 10 milligram package size with this year we see about 7,000 units that's a 7x growth over last year no again another trying to keep an eye on I would really want to look at this next month and see if that continues to grow so that I understand that segment also I don't think I have it highlighted but just above that in the drops mixes and elixirs we see the 0 to 5 milligram last year at 10,000 units up to 25,000 this year so again here we're looking at some really rapid growth two and a half times growth over a year these are some places that I would be keeping an eye on if this is the space that I was either in or thinking about being in the other way that I would look at this graph is if I were a retailer it's important for me to watch this data over time and make sure I have the right stuff in the back if I was using just things that I learned about last year even a few months ago I might go really heavy into for instance those 10 milligram carbonated while they still are a really common segment I think I would want to make sure that I'm really covering these drops mixes elixirs and syrups as well because it seems like something that consumers like alright that concludes our beverages section so now we're going to move on into edibles and do a similar exercise so inaudible let's start about looking at the total market so remember I think we saw that edibles were about 60 million this month in a 90 day time frame that works out so you know around 180 million dollars before remember Washington and Colorado has the largest sales now we see California that's what we would expect California's about twice the size of other states but Steve that teal bar there in California is not quite twice the size of it is that it is in Colorado and maybe even Washington there's a little bit lesser than inaudible space so something to think about the other thing I pointed out when we were talking about beverages was that the prices were relatively close together across the state here we see a very big difference in price with prices in Nevada being over $20 and here in Washington our average edible cost under 14 so good for us here in Washington with our not too expensive edibles so let's dive in again and see what it's made up of oh I'm sorry first let's see how it's growing oh my gosh Steve I almost got ahead of myself there I'm just so excited about edibles don't get ahead of the growth yeah no we got to talk about this growth because it's great growth so if we look we see that Colorado has the largest market share there edibles this is in 2017 if we add 2018 everybody saw increasing audible sales and California entered the market again pretty strong with 13% there California has had a bit of a decline this year but everybody else again we see market share gains in edibles what that means is the added the edibles category is growing faster than the other categories around it at least the average category now we can look and see what it's composed of just a few more segments here inaudible there are in in beverages for sure I'm only going to call out the big ones there are some smaller ones in here that I'm not going to focus on today things like savory edibles or cooking ingredients but our big ones the first that I notice is of course gummy and remember we'll read this graph the same way we read the beverages one so that bar up at the top that's the first quarter of 2018 and it goes quarter by quarter all the way down to the third quarter of 2019 so what we see with that blue bar there in the middle is that gummies have really increased their market share throughout this time I don't think that caught my eye was that chocolate market share was declining I'm not actually going to dig into that today but that would be something really interesting to look into to see if we could figure out why gummies are growing so much faster than chocolate sniff there's anything there I do believe that in gummy as we see a lot of CBD and THC combined products and in chocolates it seems to be a bit more teach be or CBD so perhaps that's a bit of it if I could jump in I just want to have you distinguish chocolate from cookies because the colors are real similar there can you comment on that oh absolutely yeah so chocolates are the teal color so those are ranging between about 30% back in 2018 to 17% today and then cookies are that greener color sort of there between the chocolates and the gummy again a bit of a decline there from about seven and a half percent a little over a year and a half ago to about 5% today cool now let's look again at how the states are different remember our stickball is really different before here what we see is that three of our state relatively similar in Washington is the odd duck so in our three states that do look similar we see that gummies are a really substantial portion of the market one of the reasons that gummies aren't quite so large here in Washington is there was some regulatory stuff with them a few years ago there are a lot more government entering our market now I imagine that chair will probably change so for those folks who are not in Washington the regulatory stuff involved making it harder for me to get my gummy open Oh what it was I see yeah you don't want it to be too difficult to open alright so looking at this I think we can kind of get an idea the most of states are similar the only other thing I wanted to call out is that chocolates are less common in Nevada than they are other places and that California is starting to see some mints so the very dark purple maroon bar up at the top in Washington it's nine point two seven percent of our sales go to mints in California that's six percent so those two states do see mints come into play though not as much in other states so next remember we looked at things by the segment they belong to and now we'll look at them by the size they are so here we see a space is very dominated by 100 milligram packages so in beverages they were most common they were a decent port of them a portion of the market but it was about half maybe even laughs here in edibles we see about two thirds all the way up to 84% there in Nevada of the total units sold are going to be 200 milligrams packages so the only other thing to note maybe their Washington is this really big group of 10 milligrams we don't see maybe quite that large of a group anywhere else in California at California has a whole lot of colors there right so maybe a lot more choice options in California but since this market is pretty dominated by 100 milligram pack rather than me investigating the landscape where we're looking at this segment and the package size what I'd like to do is think of a third way to investigate these categories and that would be by the price since we saw the prices were cheapest in Washington I mean go ahead and I'm going to investigate that and see what that could mean so first before we do that what I want to make sure because I'm going to do it by segment is that all of the segments are dominated by 100 milligram packages and that is the case so we see in Washington not of those five large segments any one of them all on the staff you wouldn't be able to read it for sure but other than most larger segments what we see is they are all dominated by one hundred milligram packs perhaps a little bit of an anomaly there in mints with a lot of 20 milligram packages but for the most part we're seeing the bulk of the sales coming from 100 milligrams so we are going to continue to dive in 200 milligrams we're going to stay right in there 900 milligram so first let's look at the prices remember we had just the average prices of everything together and now we're looking at it by a category so we see that gummies caramels chews and Taffy's and chocolates all right they're together maybe 15 16 dollars whereas candies maybe something a little bit cheaper but the average price call before I do this one I'm going to go back sorry to spoil her that for you guys the average price isn't always the best way to look at stuff and so what I want to do is break it down by price bucket and the reason I want to do that is just to give a very easy example is let's imagine a segment that has only two products than it sees a product that costs $10 and a product that cost $40 so the average price of those two products would be $25 but $25 doesn't tell us anything about how that segment actually looks so what I want to do is investigate these segments a little bit more what I want you to remember is when we were looking at average price gummy caramel shoes and cafes and chocolates all looked really similar when we look at it by price bucket they actually look kind of different so while the most common price range in caramel shoes and Taffy's chocolates and gummies which are these three bars in the center of this graph the most common package headed average item price between $14 and 16 dollars that's a teal color they're in the middle however in gummies we see about 50% of units going to products price at 16 to 18 dollars these distributions are really different from each other so while the average item prices were relatively close what we see is in chocolates there are a lot more that are on both ends so we see a lot of higher priced item greater than $20 that's the navy blue at the end that's 15% of chocolates versus things that are under $12 that'd be the purple in the red there on the left is another 15% of the market so chocolates have a lot of expensive products and a lot of cheap products whereas gummies have mostly products all in the middle so one of the reasons that when we compare prices across categories we want to make sure that we're not just looking into averages but the way to the price breaks down the other thing I want to call out is that candies remember we did see a slightly lower average item price for that those are very dominated by products that cost between ten and twelve dollars and then mints are very dominated by products that cost more than $18 so over half of the sales 66% of the sales in fact are to products that cost more than $18 so those are the two blue bars the bright blue in the navy blue just like we did for the beverages what I want to do is compare this across time and see if it's different a whole lot of colors here no need to panic I'm going to highlight the stuff that's important so the thing that I think is most important I'm going to do it segment by segment is that when we're looking at today which is the graph there on the left and we're looking at a year ago just the graph there on the right today we see that a lot of the sales are dominated in this candy segment by that 10 to 12 dollar range is what we saw that was fewer before we saw more expensive candies in the marketplace before about a year ago the same is going to be true there in caramel shoes and Cathy's so here when we look at products in the $10 to $16 price bucket that's almost 50% of sales before it was very small we had a lot in the 16 to 18 dollars there 48 percent so again we shifted there to the left so we're shifting to cheaper products if we go to chocolate same thing here if we look at the bright green the bright blue and the dark blue last year we're looking at most of the sales occurring to product over $16 has shifted today we see most of sales happening to products that are under $15 again that's oddest this year on the left and August of 2018 on the right yes it's exactly what you're looking at Facebook similar story same song different chorus here with gummies again this graph is shifting toward cheaper cheaper priced products last year 36 percent of sales were to products that were priced between 18 and 20 dollars that's that bright blue bar there on the right only 10% today though we really see a pretty big shift and then finally our outlier every every statistician really loves an outlier our outlier is mints so if we look at mints the way the market was last year we see that 31 percent of the sales were to 10 to 12 dollar products that's the red bar only 19 percent today in fact if we look at the very expensive products those print over 20 dollars that's about a fifth of the market today or 21% last year was like 15 so while all four of our other segments have started to shift to lower price buckets mints are actually going in the opposite direction and becoming pricier I thought it was a very interesting trend it's definitely something I would want to keep an eye on and see how this is pricing whether I'm a retailer or a manufacturer manufacturers to set their price with the retailer's but retailers to know what consumers are seen on average so we do see mints going up the price but their sales growth seems pretty healthy so I think that that's really about the marketplace so what I would like to do a quick recap for the total market we saw about a half billion dollars of monthly revenue coming from our four state the entire country of Canada sees about 90 million a month right now in Canadian dollars though that is growing faster than the US is growing in fact it's growing at about 6 percent month-over-month which is that rate continues we would expect to be a Canadian market to double by next year Canada was dominated by flowers but I think a lot of us because there are no beverage in the edibles yes yes but hopefully I'll be able to do this again for everybody in the bring up next year and we can look to see what Canadians think about edibles especially because there you saw that our edibles and beverages were dominated by Center milligram packages I believe the limit Canada is only going to be ten milligram we're going to be a really different product landscape there and then finally we looked at the beverages market where we saw it's about one percent of the adult youth market but the assortment is really different by state and then we look into the edibles market which is about ten percent and was dominated by this one hundred milligram packages so the pricing was fairly different so I think the one of the big takeaways for me if I'm in either the beverage or edible space is that perhaps I should be looking for inspiration outside the state them in to see what sorts of things exist in our growing because it could be an opportunity for me to bring something new and interesting to my state and that's really about what I have well that's fantastic Liz so what we're going to do is turn now to some of the questions you all putting through the zoom Q&A section please do continue to put your questions there and as Liz goes to review those I just wanted to call out that we're helping D tonight's all around the country so watch for us in your area and if you don't have a day tonight nearby let us know and we'll get one set up secondly we've got some industry reports available to our subscribers and nonsubscribers there's one on edible solid sales steady growth and then one on beverages is weed the new beer it's a deep dive and then the cannabis infused beverages also produced by liz and her team if you're not a subscriber just go to headset Daioh and scroll all the way to the bottom and you'll see links to recent industry reports there Liz yeah absolutely I have a whole lot of questions popping up if you do have any other ones feel free to submit them here I'm gonna answer as many of them as I can but if we don't answer your questions you can always reach out to us and we can get you answers for those I have a lot of questions about the beverages space so I'm gonna do those first and one of the first questions was do mocktails include cannabis beer and the answer is yes so for those on the phone that aren't from with Kanna beers is what they're usually called it is AD alcoholized beer just been infused with THC CBD or both and those are that we put those in the mocktail segment here as they're definitely a growing segment for sure they do not contain alcohol so it is something that is why we call the mocktails there's no alcohol in them mocktails also includes some faux wine so again at the alkalized wine that's been infused with THC or CBD it also includes we're starting to see a lot of I guess faux alcohols pop up or faux cocktails who we see things like a mojito for instance it'll be in a jar it looks like a liquor jar or like a real fancy bourbon bottle and it may be you know lime and mint flavored like a mojito but instead of alcohol it's infused with THC those using multi serve beverages so it's like a bottle and you would share it among people versus the kin of beers we definitely see those be single serve I've not seen any like really large can of beers and then the wine again are usually packaged as multi serve we do also see at least one or two cannabis infused champagne I think you have to calm sparkling wines I don't think they're made in France ah alright so I just wanted to point out something that someone brought up one of the people on the line brought up it in Nevada there's a big presence for to root in low potency levels so for anybody not familiar with to roots it is a can of beer company I think they do like an IPA and lager maybe you're an ale they might even actually I think they have a handful of product and those are they're packaged in I think twelve ounce packages and again low potency levels we're talking two three five milligrams so you kind of consume those more like beers right maybe even someone is a short as me can maybe even have oh god maybe even three of those about how many beers I can have two they really dose was out right didn't they alright so continuing along our beverages question another question I had is is the cost of beverage for single serves or multi packs the answer is both so the way we think about the way when we're looking at those cost me think about package size we're actually really just thinking about the amount of PHC in it I think it is probably safe to assume that for most users the hundred milligram packages will be multisearch maybe save for a handful of enthusiasts their high enthusiasts who I got a pun in their volumes absolutely yeah so but other than that I think when we're seeing the hundred milligram so they're generally going to be multi served and those lower milligrams are going to be single serve I've got a question in which category are shots I've not seen shots like a buttery crown or whether I don't know kamikaze but it could be in mocktails if it's faking a or not faking if it is a faux alcohol drinks like a lemon drop or something like that if you mean energy shots those would be in other I believe depends how they're packaged some companies are packaging their energy shots actually as tinctures and those going to temperature spec category so really just a pen that's a new question for me I never thought of workshops for alright so I had another question what about the lounges for cannabis edibles this was posted by an anonymous attendee and I assume it's anonymous because I'm not yet aware of many places where it's legal to have a consumption lounge there are a handful of cities and a handful of I think that San Francisco now those event venues where you can consume on premise but we really don't see a lot of on-premise sales just yet for either beverages or edibles if beverages are we're out of out of bowls were sold at a legal adult youth retail establishment as part of an event or they had that license then it would likely be trapped in our data but definitely for the most part that consumption lunges I've run across might still be a bit gray market which we don't cover I was asked if will offer a series on CBD either edibles or beverages and I'm happy to report that we already did so our last webinar covered CBD and we basically we looked a bit in the topicals a bit into edibles but all of our data at nights right now are covering cvd edibles and beverages so we're doing those we've done them in Washington we did one in San Francisco and in Los Angeles there's one coming up on the 26th I think in Santa Cruz as well on the 26th in Denver I'm sorry in Portland him so the 26th is Santa Cruz in Portland the 10th is Denver so if you're in Denver and you were really excited and thinking oh that's too far away don't worry we're doing it on the 10th in Denver if you're interested in learning more about those webinars you can reach out to sales at headset thought i/o and they get you signed up for sure or if they're not in an area and you want to reach out I believe we have some links to recorded webinars on it as well I had someone on the line ask if we can send out a copy of a deck because lots of people in their org need to see those numbers man that's a great comment I didn't even put that one in myself yes we will send up the deck it will be available I am not 100% it'll be sent out afterward I think to everybody that has RSVP'd looking at my my marketing guy over here to make sure I'm not not making them things up again I had another question if we do reports like this for CBD not only do we do reports which we did do a market report we have hold dashboards that are just focused on products that contain CBD in all five of those non inhalable categories these DVD sales are CVD at recreational dispensaries so it's not the CPD that you see in perhaps places like CVS but it's the CVD containing product in these rep dispensaries so there are a lot of CBD only products and then a lot of products contain some CBD and some THC so they're legally sold in recreational dispensaries and those can't be sold now that places didn't get to attribute gumgum II sales to their potentially containing a lot of simi beyond the get-go yeah absolutely I think that's a big part of it so if you are interested in learning more about CBD or getting insights like this and actually even deeper insights like you can reach out again to sales at headset Daioh and they can set you up with some demos of those dashboards they're really excellent products let's see I had a question about what falls into ingredients in edibles those are usually things like oils and butters so I think there are a handful is like a couple flowers and some some powders that are like a sugar substitute or they might actually be sugar even with some THC in them those are things that you bake with so if you're someone with a degree in French pastry let's say who likes to bake maybe you don't want to buy your cookies you want to bake them for yourself so those would be those types of products that the Baker's buy let me know sorry I'm getting questions as I'm doing this so let me awkwardly read through the question Steve you want to make up some things to talk about real quick while I do that yes please reach out to us at sales at headset dot IO for links to previous recordings especially on the CBD topic happy to share those with you and perhaps we'll do a refresh on that in the very near future to let you know what's going on in the CBD space maybe in Canada or how it's changed a quarter yeah all right before I let Steve make up too much stuff I can get back to the questions now so someone asked if the Canadian sales numbers include exports to other countries they do not so when we're looking at the Canadian sales numbers those would be sales in retail establishments in Canada the top-line numbers that I was giving you the total sales by province those are actually from stat Canada Statistics Canada they publish retail numbers so I'd encourage you to google that I think it's just statistics Canada comma cannabis retail and you can find those numbers yourself the numbers when we're looking at the percentage of the category or the prices or the brands even again that is just sales within the province of Alberta that's insights data and that's data that we sell so if you're interested in learning more about the Canadian province of Alberta and what it's composed of please reach out to us and we can hook you up with insights for not province I believe that is all the questions that have for today I do have a couple of questions about the FDA's position I try not to speak for the government so I don't really know much about the FDA's position on stuff I would encourage you to to reach out to maybe someone in more of a legal legal career path for that sort of thing and then I the last question I had was does my audibles data disregard sales that include CB d like did I evaluate teach the only product and the answer is no I evaluated edible products sold in recreational dispensaries so it could have been THC only it could have been CBD only it could have been a combination of the two and if you're interested in how that breaks down and how it affects growth and prices I'd encourage you to reach out to our sales team and they can demo you those CBD dashboards I think that's all the questions if you think of any later though reach out to us and we're happy to help awesome Liz thank you so much for what has been lavish and and I'm out of gustatory adjectives for now thank you very very much as always it's a lot of fun listening to he will run down the data like you've done here so for everyone out there listening you will have slides in a recording and I don't know can we call you back for an encore or oh man these are my favorite yeah for sure okay so we'll send out notifications as to the the next topic and scheduled date for a webinar and we're very much looking forward to it so for everyone on the call thank you so much for playing and we'll see you on the next one you", "IeYVffYJWjQ": "okay i think we'll go ahead and get started because we have an awful lot to talk about in the next hour uh so welcome everyone really glad that you're with us this morning thank you for making the time for this very important topic my name is kim porter i'm the executive director of be a part of the conversation we're a non-profit in southeastern pennsylvania we serve five counties including montgomery county they are our hosts today and our partner in this and our funder and we are very grateful to them um today's program is funded as part of the youth marijuana prevention project this is a five-year initiative that started a year ago in july so we're just in the start of our second year and this is something we've been really looking forward to so really very grateful to have you all with us today thank you for being a change maker in the state of pennsylvania so i want to let you know that we are recording this presentation um we are you are all in just viewing mode only so we cannot see or hear you um we're only going to be recording the presentation portion of this we'll stop recording when we get to the q a section we don't want anyone to feel at all intimidated to ask questions but just so you know if you're asking questions throughout the program during valves or ben's presentations um you will we will not be the recording will not pick up those questions they will just be um you know within this this meeting so don't worry about that um the link uh to the recording will be available later today so we have this program scheduled to go until 9 30. but uh ben cord our featured presenter today has agreed to stay on with us um he originally talked about an hour maybe 30 minutes where his schedule's getting a little bit crazy today but if need be he'll stay on for at least a half an hour after this program if there are additional questions that aren't answered also um there's a page on our website that we've dedicated to this program and this topic our website is as you can see at the bottom of your screen conversation dot zone uh if you go to conversation dot zone slash lead as in taking the lead then you'll find the follow-up page which will have the recording of the presentation this morning it will also have loads of other information we have a q a section where we'll try to get to some of the topics that are or some of the questions that are coming up that we've already noticed in the advanced questions that many of you submitted that there are some themes and a lot of really great questions about the developing adolescent brain and all of that lots of information will be on our site about that and it's there right now but it's not there yet is of course the recording because we're live uh and also this is something that we're doing um separately from our our um agreement with the county but this is something we're presenting ben has graciously agreed because we know that we have a lot of questions out there he's graciously agreed to come back and visit us in october on the 15th we're calling it lessons learned from colorado because as you will find out ben court is a marijuana policy expert from the state of colorado so he certainly has a lot of lessons to share with us so we're grateful that he will be with us on that date at the same time at 8 30 we're going to make that at 8 30 to 10 a.m presentation so we'll have information about how to join that meeting uh soon that'll be on the follow-up page as well uh we also have a program coming up this is part of the youth marijuana prevention project uh this is at the end of october the 27th cannabis it's complicated especially for kids so we will be talking about the way marijuana cannabis impacts that developing teenage brain we will have someone in recovery from cannabis use disorder with us we'll have a clinician talking with us so i think that should be very interesting i just want to give you a very brief snapchat snapshot of what marijuana use is looking like in pennsylvania these days and i know that we have some prevention providers with us so you've seen this before but i think all of us need to just have a quick look at this past 30-day use um the pennsylvania youth survey is done every two years in grades sixth eighth tenth and twelfth so we're looking at 2015 2017 and 2019. so it's the same population being surveyed every other year and when we look at this in pennsylvania past 30-day use this is not lifetime or past year but past 30-day use of marijuana you can see you know 12th graders are up to about 20 percent of them are over the last six years have been using um cannabis if you look and vaping of course this is something that wasn't even measured before 2015 but you can see how it has increased um in the last three or the last three surveys that were taken you can see that the use has gone up in vaping when students who said that they were vaping were asked which products they're vaping um when we then when asked about marijuana or hash oil oil these are the numbers um of students who were vaping in the past year indicated that they were using marijuana or hash oil there's a lot of other data and we have the full pays report on our website on that follow-up page so we encourage you to check that out we also have the montgomery county results there as well so at the end of this program when we're finished you will have an opportunity that something will pop up on your screen inviting you to take our survey we really appreciate you doing that because it helps us to know we've been effective what else you might need to hear from us in the future um and we really encourage you to do that helps us tremendously in our future programming and just a reminder to follow up on that page on our website so it is my great pleasure to introduce you to dr val arkus she is the chair of the montgomery county board of commissioners so i will stop sharing my screen and say welcome to you dr urkush thank you so much for being here oh you're muted val all right let's try that again good morning everyone and kim it's so great to see you and i want to thank you and be a part of the conversation for putting this really important discussion together this morning be a part of the conversation is such a critical partner in the work that we're doing in montgomery county through our office of drug and alcohol around a number of issues around substance use disorder and other challenges across our community so just want to thank you for convening all of us and to thank all of you that are attending this morning at an early time on a friday morning i know there were close to 300 people registered and it looks like you know the vast majority of them have signed in and i'm particularly happy as i was scrolling through the attendee list to see so many members of our montgomery county community that i know individuals that work for the county across multiple different departments we've got members of law enforcement on this call members of and representatives of different community groups so i just want to thank all of you for participating i do believe this is an issue that affects all of us and is one that is something that is actually very complicated in a lot of different ways there are issues around youth use particularly as kim has already mentioned the developing brain but this also dovetails with issues of social justice and criminal justice in our communities and there's been we know historically very real impacts there as well so this is a complicated issue and i'm very grateful to hear ben court's perspective on this issue i have been as you all know i'm a very data driven individual i'm a physician by background for those of you who don't know me and i have been very interested in watching what has happened in colorado over the last several years so i'll be interested to hear the latest on october 15th and we'll definitely try to tune in for that but i think it's really important that we see what's happened in other places both good and also things that are cautionary notes and that if we do end up moving forward in in the state of pennsylvania with some sort of legalization of non-medicinal use of cannabis i think it's just very important that we look and see how that's gone in other states and what can we learn from that here so i'm very grateful to have this conversation very interested to hear the multiple perspectives on this issue and kim again just want to thank you for your leadership on this issue it's been so important to our community thank you so much dr kush really appreciate you being here and for your kind words um ben i'm not going to do a big introduction because i know people will learn about you on our website we have your bio there but ben has presented with us many times you can find other videos of his on our youtube page which i'll also be sharing but if you want to unmute and say hello to our guests and we'll let you get started thank you so much ben unmuting good morning everybody um thank you very much dr akush and kim of course thank you i'm sorry that uh this is virtual um i'm always excited when kim calls because uh my my little sister is in upper box and uh so every time i i do something with um kim and her amazing organization i get to go and stay there and make a little bit of trouble with uh my 11 year old nephew um so i'm going to see if i can share my screen here you would think that after all of this time doing um doing this i'd be better at it so kim just to clarify so um i know we're gonna go until uh 9 30 and then we're going to open to questions is that correct correct um well we were going to have you try to get to questions earlier than that if we can because we've we've told folks that we would have this program from 8 30 to 9 30. so if we can wrap up before 9 30 that would be great um and we're looking at your desktop right now yes ma'am okay 30 minutes to discuss this subject uh means that you gotta get ready to drink from a fire hose even if i'm going to be judicious and what i'm going to um share with you as we go through all of the questions and as uh i've had conversations with people in pennsylvania um it was my wife's from theirs uh where we met were married uh i know the state um i i tried to figure out a couple of things that might be of the most interest to you uh and as we were doing this even just getting into the uh a couple of points it might be just pulled kim there's just no way we can do any of the justice so um i'm asked i could come back uh i'll be back in a couple weeks to do more but i'm also going to give you some resources at the end because the reality is that um when we made this decision in colorado we did not have anyone uh who went ahead of us and that that means that we weren't able to look at and consider uh a real world application um you in pennsylvania are able to do that with multiple different states and and the trick is like anything that is politics i mean my goodness in a presidential election year uh this is a factor 10 like anything is politics uh a lot of the times the information gets drowned out by the the volume of the police that are yelling um so i have always attempted to stay apolitical in this kim did you have something yeah your audio is a little bit um choppy i don't know if there's anything you can do on your end i'm not sure if you're using you know i don't see earbuds but just so you know you're a little i'm not using okay i'm not using it um it's distracting enough that i should shut applications down and things i don't think so i would keep going all right i'm not gonna move except for to advance the screen so uh all of that time wasted to tell you i'm not gonna waste my time on this i'm going to try and go quickly um so listen the the bottom line is that um you absolutely have to make sure that we're looking at real and valid information because of the money involved in this and because the deep deep politics here a lot of what happens ends up being spun pretty hard by both sides of this and here were a couple of different decencys to start that i thought you might be interested in because um there's such solid uh data so real science is general publishing and peer-reviewed real science is is not a survey uh they have very little interest most days what's 32 percent of america believes because last time you checked a majority of this country thought that the bachelor was the best show on television kim am i having trouble here yeah a little bit and i also want to make sure that you're not showing a powerpoint right now correct because we're still looking at your your your fault your folders i don't know why your audio is still kind of choppy kim can you see this yes and any better on the audio well right now it is we'll see how it goes there you go all right i apologize everybody no i should have stopped you ah stupid internet all right so these are a couple of nice studies for you to consider at first um but again there are quite a few uh my um personal belief in this is that you should always give these things a little bit of time to breathe because what will happen a lot of times just a preliminary data summary will be monday and by tuesday you've got people writing articles about it saying that it was the silver bullet that i was waiting for um so i i kind of like to give the science a little while to breathe but these are a couple of really nice places to start the reason why i i so prefer um the metastatic entire volkov game here is that a summary of um all things known up until about 2014 uh about cannabis and i think the most important one that we have considered as one that's bold originally published february 2015 please please look into this one it's called the effects of hypocrisy cannabis and psychosis and that's published in lancet and there have been multiple follow-ups since so the most important thing that you have to understand uh and what happened in colorado was that cannabis changed fundamentally and this is the new school campus it's not what you spoke in the 70s i hope that you can see see this kim just give me a thumbs up making sure you can still see my screen now i'm all tech self-conscious here um what we did in colorado was not simply um here's just pure uh opinion on this i've always been somebody who's been comfortable with and and you've advocated for the decrimination of uh what we did was we opened up a full commercial market too and as you know uh this country commercial markets very very very well so fundamentally what happened uh in colorado was the advent of a new um really a new substance and it's based substance but uh our market is not made up of the plant anymore plant plays a role in it but it's um products that are based on the plants so uh let me explain to you a little bit what happened here so colorado voted in 2012 in 2014 january 1 2014 we opened up retail so these data are um absolutely beautiful and unfortunately we have not seen a continuation and it doesn't look like we will see a continuation uh because of some some poor decisions made at the federal level um but beginning in 1960 and ending in 2011 uh university of mississippi uh tracked a record to the symbol of all of cannabis confiscated inside of america as you'll see you see this red line right here is thc chc is the psychoactive ingredient inside of cannabis if you don't have thc you have hip you have a very interesting textile favorite juice and um used to make a boat and probably have a lot of uses than that but no thc no high more ta18 high oversimplified but that's all we got time for this one so as you'll see uh beginning in 1960 and steadily rising until 2011 we got more thc bred into our marijuana and the reason why is that we have a guy around here and uh this is a country that supersizes its big mac and if one is good two's definitely gotta be better so um the thing that i'd like to point out to you before i switch slides especially to those of you who are more interested in the science of this uh is that if you go back to 1960 here we're going to follow this line into perfect uh backwards to perpetuity we're we're to look at this um into you know crawling out of the ocean or coming down from trees or walking out of the garden or whatever like um that line would have stayed the same because naturally occurs inside of cannabis is somewhere between a point two and point five percent the agency um that's what humankind has been interacting with for millennium uh and what we started was of course there were exceptions to that particularly in certain religious traditions ben i'm going to interrupt you um we're getting some complaints about the sound so it's just very hard to hear so i'm wondering if you could try um signing in from your phone like keep your audio on mute yourself and then and then if you can join from your phone would you mind trying that not at all a couple of people have made that suggestion so perhaps they've experienced this as well you can continue to share your screen and all that it's just that the audio i apologize folks hang in there and you know when we talked with ben when we were getting started he sounded perfectly crystal clear and the three of these that i do a day all worked out great until now of course are you able to get signed in ben yeah but i've joined it as an attendee i i wonder if this has gotten any better at all than if i can try to keep it sounds okay right now go ahead go ahead so um cam maybe katie could you send me another link so it's at the top of my uh inbox and or kim sorry and if we have to switch back over we will okay all right keep on going for now okay if you can see everybody good on the slide kim you see it you go okay so what happened then uh was the introduction of the commercial market and again the continuation of these data looks highly highly unlikely as does the continuation with that from colorado which is um very frustrating so what you see here if you go back uh we were looking at increments of 2.5 over the course of 50 years and it's here to increment a five uh just to get that in the blue lines colorado and unfortunately we probably won't see a continuation of that past 2016 because those of you who are a little more cyber-minded public policy-minded um there has been a very very poor job actual data collection uh i don't think there's a ton of interest in determining um what's what's really happening inside of the substance we paid you know what's happening in the sales of it but not in the actual growth of the substance so um if you'll look at the green line beginning in 1860 the um the bottom line to this and what i'd like to tell folks is i think that what we did in colorado taught you how to turn a plant into a drawer because there is the difference between a point two percent two percent ten percent tc and a thirty four fifty sixty seventy percent uh is profound and part of the problem is that uh very very little was known about what concentrations that high we're doing inside of the human brain and body and the science still fairly emergent but we do know what it's doing from a mental health standpoint and it's very very concerning um so if for no other reason um i i show you this to show you that what most people perceive this to be which is a market about a plant is fairly benign the planet used to be pretty benign um and the the roots of why we criminalized it at the beginning uh were insidious they were racist to their core however we're not talking about that plant anymore uh we're now talking about a pretty well developed substance uh that there's huge commercial interest in here's what happens when we go from uh good farming to good chemistry when it goes from the street uh with a couple of acres to monsanto and there is not an interest in the interest part um sustained foreign practices for um moderate products there's an interest in some more that they they have so let me shift really quickly here to share with you is dr kushner any other physician uh knows well that the diagnosing of a chin is is not something that can be done uh subjectively uh one must meet diagnostic criteria there are eleven um so here are the eleven i'm afraid i'm not gonna take time to unpack this but when i need you to understand is that addiction the field in which i work um is not diagnosed arbitrarily like any other medical condition you have to meet objective criteria and when it comes to understanding uh addiction to thc campus um we should be saying thc not canada as a whole to thc bsm which is the manual that the physicians and mental health professionals find all of their uh criteria in uh four years ago the dsm-5 came out actually uh listed cannabis withdrawal as a diagnosis for the first time ever so that's the physical withdrawal for tv which i think like 10 years ago if somebody was talking about withdrawal from cam cannabis um we probably meant that they were eating way way less yes and goldfish and yani's music sucked again um they weren't physically withdrawing from anything but this fact that in the last couple of years we now have changed the substance to lunch um a person is can be physically dependent on is a really big deal which it makes all set up and the the side of this is just weed it's just when it's tweed um that's why i would challenge you that it was it was just a plan and for a long long time that argument was true but it simply isn't because the plant that humankind interacted with from millennium has been replaced by something pretty significant so uh going back to considering the addiction the addictive potential of this here's some simple numbers for you uh when colorado opened up retail in 2014 we had fewer than 300 uh licensed campus facilities in the state as of the last year we don't have any data for 20 to me yet as of last year that number went to 2709. um so that's a pretty significant factor it's a a factor of about nine uh but it's grown in five years and so the the reality to this is that the only way that we can continue to support this amount of growth is we have a market throws with it and there are only two ways market uh this is econ one um there's only two ways to go to market it's one you capture new users or two you prefer current users more frequent users now the problem is with an addictive substance or a substance with potential addictive properties which cannabis simply is um objectively you can't argue that without um throwing the science out of it less addictive than some things more addictive than others um the reason why this matters so much is that the majority of the market ends up being made up by the problem user so what we've already seen with alcohol and tobacco sales uh in about 60 years worth of tracking these data is that uh roughly 20 of the consumer population will consume about 80 of commercial sales of those um the alcohol industry is not interested at all if in her occasional that's going with dick they do however love the guy who found mad dog 2020 when he was 12 years old um but unfortunately i beat the game i got so in colorado the last ad that we have from 2017 shows us that 84 percent of the thc in colorado uh is being consumed 15 of the consumers so when you unpack who those consumers are that's why it's important to understand the addictive work is the the va majority of this market is not made up of despite what the advertisements would we would love to tell them show the world the it's not made up of people who look like me going home to work trying to decide between a nice bottle of merlot or an edible um it is made up of the problem user and the problem user uh as the one who drives that market you have to understand who they are because they are my people i work inside of a chemical dependency and i'm someone who has some long-standing mental health issues i've worked with were through myself depressive disorder as well as ptsd those of us with um mental health conditions the minority population both sexual minority as well as ethnic minority um and the lower income communities in colorado are the ones who make up that 20 percent now here's where i will um tell you that there's maybe an opportunity for collaboration kim uh between uh the world of the organization and uh if you guys should move forward with us in pennsylvania what might happen um is i i know how interested you guys are in preserving the the minds of the kids estate i know you guys love kids what we have found in colorado is so does the cannabis industry because when you are are considering the three factors that put somebody into this group of people consuming 84 to build the problemed user i.e the better consumer there are three factors well there's four but we can't control anything to do with genetic predisposition um those three factors for age of onset frequency of use and thc potency so the earlier summer starts the more frequently they use and the stronger the substance is the more likely they are to be from my perspective a problem user from the industry's perspective a reliable customer and it is the same as it has always been with addictive substances it's the same with um same tobacco it's the same with alcohol and uh the reality here is that we know better and so that's why i encourage everybody to be uh to familiarize themselves with the symptoms of substance use disorder so that you can get more used to asking the questions around the ac dependence so let me just show you a couple things that have happened in colorado is to work to capture more users that's actually cookie monster on the side of the dispensary down here with a plate full of dope by the way now they're not selling an invitational kid who's gonna walk in there of course not but what this is is long-term hearts and minds campaigns and this been one of the hardest things to challenge here in colorado is this generation who has grown up with this is the norm uh with with uh the the smell and the sights and everything as the norm and then when they actually get uh and you know they've got 10 11 uh symptoms for cannabis use disorder they're still not a big deal we have facsimiles of things that are clearly used with pardon me young people you know here's the emoji store um on that's all cannabis related not to targeted towards adults there's actual back to school special uh in colorado um this was the open house guide for high schools and junior highs that we had last year that they gave all the kids in boulder county where i live and as you'll see the first open enrollment community the the first page had a half page color app bringing dispensary that was coming to town that was branded to look like a starbucks um here's a moving special cu boulder so specifically targeting um uh freshmen and talks just comes out of the battle though messages tell me to smoke weed every day don't forget daily there's really no in this and then messaging that the kids have grown up with is stay high and um it's changed the way that we have to interact with people in our hour here because this has always been the norm form um so just a very brief tour through here so so here are consumption trends because the majority of the market from a thousand cents standpoint it's made up of concentrates and then after that it's edibles and and this is why i say that it's not the plant anymore that we're talking about uh sales of or green organic material that's dried out that yeah rolling and joining smoke they're there they're a much much smaller part of the market so uh beginning in 2014 marijuana enforcement division has released an annual update and for the first three years of it uh we didn't even consider concentrates in there so if you're not familiar with concentrates hang on a second because i'm gonna do what the market looks like um in 2017 support the first time they actually report um sales on it so we did our market into three right we have our market our market black market completely under the table gray market one that is either grown legally and sold illegally or grown illegally and so deeply and then our white market where everything above taxes so inside of our white market which is the smaller um in 2017 we taxed the sale of just about 28 000 pounds of concentrate and um in 2018 that number moved to 40 000 pounds of concentrate now the reason why that matters if you can see the antioxidant over here to the right it's um it says the top line says more is not better cannabis concentrates are potent start by consuming a small dose about half the size it's a pin head or less so in a recommended dosage of half the size of a pen head selling 40 000 pounds is a really really big deal and this isn't from juice this is what the young people are initiating on um multiple times a day this is how we've had to change the way that we um discuss recovery from abstinence to cannabis because to the younger generation cannabis is concentrate um and concentrates are up to 99.9 percent hd so the reason that lancet study i mentioned at the beginning the effects of high potency um cannabis psychosis is so important is it has given us uh um kind of a long-term glimpse of the cohort um using 16 thc and know what that's doing to their mental health and it's um uh not good uh the psychosis is associated with and the mental health issues are a big deal the reason why it's so important is we have very very limited information above 16 potency because this is all happening real quickly and if you consider that and then thrown around here um his 99 thc um be the uh humankind knows very very little about this substance except for we don't make it we know how to sell it we know how to market it we don't know a lot more about it um it's gone very quickly this is like sensors all the time not to consume i'm sober but to research um and these are this is called distillate these distillates are absolutely everywhere it's some you get um you get basically people purchased a lot of different places that's because this is something we're trying to move people forward so we're gonna skip our videos um i am going to show you some specific pictures of this commercial market and as i do i want you any of you i'm 41 years old maybe for me your mid-20s consider the maybe maybe what it is that we know and are going to attempt to regulate is an old model t maybe get going 30 miles an hour down when in reality um what we need to be considering and regulating and thinking about is you know the body that's ripping around at 140 miles an hour because when i was young if you could see this um can you see my cursor kim where i'm kind of highlighting it here was that okay so this that was weak that um bud this um grown uh thc leaf leafs trimmed off but today uh this is almost a forgotten market because the market looks more like butter and wax and shatter today the commercial market is growing so quickly to support the needs of those of of that small of people who are making the majority of the market that this is what we looks like today um here's something that we would probably call uh uh honey or honey well this will be in the 60 ish here's something called a live resin um this is 60 percent shares are what pushed the upper limits getting 90 this is percent live resin this is not fringe use this sort of thing is the majority of the market in colorado the market doesn't look like a plant the market looks like the glues so this is the distillate that i had mentioned before the 99 um and this is really what we see everywhere and where i challenge folks when they just plant it's just plentiful listen concentrates are to weed what crack is to the cocoa plant and it's it's simple uh this is not a plant this is a refined product from the plant here's what it looked like if you're going to the amount of scientific activity that has to go from a green organic material to this clear liquid this is the 99 and this is what's in every dispensary on every counter in colorado um the distillates are the beginning of our market uh here's a syringe infused here's a chapter honey oil i'm just wanting to give you an idea of what this actually looks like yet the um the narrative remains this that uh it's natural i just love this ad because i think it's a little bit more honest fueled by or powered by science fueled by nature based in something natural but really pretty scientifically advanced business and um no matter how hard you try uh and this is going to be a significant part of the market and i don't care where you live in the country this exists there uh and this is what a lot of the young people are are using and thinking about so just through a couple of definitions in from last year's best of guide uh two years ago as best of guide um shatter and and backs and uh live resin and sauce that's because i'm more than happy to share this presentation with anybody who wants it um but uh oh good here here you go here's the definition of a distillate i did let's create one of the pure canvas products on the market to spin cannabinoids down to molecular levels uh into delivering high tac content this is across this hospital that's certain cannabinoids api's generating different types of highs um so what we actually are doing is separating t to the sub molecular i split the building high in thc pull the disc bullet out it's very very advanced tough and we've got good at it here and these this is everywhere um first one's free [Laughter] uh this is just industry in america doing with industry in america that's not working or different than um the other ones they are just big business so vaping and quite a bit of information about this kim so uh go to the website learn more about picking the only thing i wanted to tell you about that is there's no smoke no smell no mess um so the majority of uh the pain that takes place is taking place because you can do it with impunity you don't smell anything um here there's a good ad amazing fun flavors no canvas smell and what people are vaping now that you know a tiny tiny little bit about kind of just concentrates i usually take it take about two hours to really teach about um but now you know a little bit you can look in here and see that that's clearly a concentrate oil so most of what's being vaped almost all of what's been invaded um is could be some form of concept and then our market supports these kind of incognito products uh the functional pan and the heat or that it's the 700 degrees that's great for the off um lighters and asthma inhalers and then just for fun there's your classic bubble gum clear that every intervention jumps up down about so edibles um the big issue with edibles is that we have not um we've not managed to shut down the putting multiple servings inside of one patch uh and and so what colorado decided on um the 10 milligrams would make up um a a legally appropriate serving of of edible the issue is we didn't really have anything to base that on um everybody has since based it on what we've done for some people in milligrams they don't even feel um for other people 10 milligrams is going to be enough to come on back for a day and a half well a day you just don't know there's so many factors involved in it but the problem is that the what colorado has done is um and what everybody who's on since this time because they keep asking of course politicians like we're awesome at this we're the best colorado is fantastic everything we do um everybody's based what they've done on on us um these ten milligrams are an issue because multiple servants inside of one package so before i show you that let me uh here's a challenge to you pennsylvania um anything that can be introduced into the human body it's being commercially produced in colorado with the hsp and in all the legal states because it's big corporations that are set up in all those states now so any way we can produce a human body is taking place with thc check this out here's a great example of that this is um a gummy in this size it's really little and it has a hundred milligrams so colorado law this has 10 legal servings inside of it so this package with a warning on it that says um power law separate each one into tenths so one nobody's doing this and then two the the problem is we continue to do it by weight even though we're not really considering potency with it because the difference between 10 milligrams of um organic material of bud and leads and stem seeds stuff like that and 10 milligrams of a distillate is profound and it's again we need new vernacular because it's not even the same thing um to consider the the plant in a distillate yet we haven't kept up with it so what were the problem is that people will ingest more than intended obviously uh because there's 10 servings inside of something you know the size of half your finger uh and it's conservative some really really potent stuff and once it's ingested this is where problems come from and this is uh nothing will solve it in the short term uh activated charcoal induced vomiting that will do what you've got to do and i i teach quite a bit on this and there are much better minds than mine that have written on it you can uh uh hide it intervening easily but you could short-term anti-psychotics for what we do and we just sort of keep the verse cool um and a lot of the times that means keeping cool inside of um a hospital environment because we don't want somebody having um a psychotic episode and going after hurting skulls or others because it processes very very differently the fact that this ends up going through your stomach and your liver and you can't stop it is very different than entering your blood or your lungs so here's another great example this is a thousand milligram graham cracker so this thing's the the size of a cracker and it has a hundred people servings in it i just uh found this advertisement this week um up to a thousand milligrams in cake pops and sodas and gummy bears and chocolates this is not a market focused on responsible adult use in the exact same way that the tobacco market isn't focused on responsible adult use and the opiate market wouldn't have done what it did if the the sacklers and all those other people didn't figure out amazing ways to market that substance to everyone this specifically look at it and targeted to people who will have issues with it just like every other addictive substance and for us to think that it's different that this one time we're going to do it magically different we're still thinking so here's some condiments barbecue sauce and ketchup and coffee and k-cup pop these are all phc infused products here's the thc infused lemonade and diffused hard candy granola bars wheat ice cream um cans uh nasal mist so you can just spray it and nobody will know anything there's no smell this is a really interesting new thing that's started in the last three years this is an intoxicating topical cream it's not the cbd that can you ever serve your medicine cabinet this is a thc based intoxicating um topical so you put it on it enter it goes to the layers and energy blood stream gti here's the dhc pill here thc lollipops particularly this one's at seven legal servings per lollipop and uh weed tea hc um gummy ac looks we have these things that are built to look like um other classic candies obviously this isn't a joke i think a lot of the times people write things that aren't true this this is real this is a pot box um if you see down here this is a pot box that can have up to 10 servings per so like pop rocks you know um sweet tarts and dc induced alcohol it's infused soda to me this is the scariest ones because these have between 80 and 120 milligrams of sugar in them and they clearly clearly are not made to appeal to the adult and these are very popular um keith cola tonight into youtube you see that they have 350 milligrams of 35 liters on the back of this container it says um for 135th which is gap and really i want you to watch this on youtube tonight because the young people and they're young people um aren't 35th if you keep up with culture at all there's thc syrup juices there you go there is a thc infused water to me this is kind of like the top of what we have accomplished um anyone anywhere anytime can be drinking tea i'm not all gonna be the wiser the new school resource officers um anything you pull somebody over they could pop in some thc gum just to get a good laugh out of it chai and mints and blah blah blah blah blah but i have time to go into all of these caffeine and dhc underarm applicators so thc deodorant spray sex lube suppositories um all of these remember that we have no fda oversight whatsoever because it's a schedule uncontrolled substance right wrong whatever it's the reality it's a schedule one controlled substance so fda and the decades of consumer protection laws fda do not apply so i'd like to read this to you this product this is the bag of the candy bar that i bought uh this product contains marijuana in its potential and allowable plus or minus 15 variants this product was produced without regulatory oversight for health safety or efficacy you're not gonna have the feds to help now with this uh you're gonna have to figure out how to keep this regulated well so listen the mental health consequences again much much better minds than i that have written on and thought of this so um i'll give you a couple of resources at the end but the bottom line is that um it used to be very benign and what we would see uh the case you would find in the literature um i i wrote a book on that i've written extensively this is my world um the cases that you would find in the literature where there were um psychosis associated with canada's use were great and they were people who had um probably some pretty significant condition prior to like that fire was burning already and that just got a little bit louder um what you think here is is there's actually some um good indications that some of these significant mental health issues um is purely causal it's not correlation that's causal all the citations are at the end if anybody's asking questions about that but um what we see with regular use of a 12 percent thc regular use being twice a week we see a two-fold increase risk exposed and you see a two half an increased risk in the diagnosis of schizophrenia um if you use before 18. see some very very alarming trends we see things like listen if i were to show you these numbers if i were to cut all of these numbers in half and and show that anybody uh at fda or one of these big governing government agencies and say hey you know we found this to be true in a chemical inside of water bottles tomorrow there will be a cold ban on all those water bottles until we got to the bottom of this because right now there's so many big um so many indicators that are scary from a scientific standpoint that we would love to have time to fully understand this however um that doesn't work with the inner employee which is well you did great last quarter what are you going to show me this order how much can i earn in 2020 versus 2019 that's why we've got this big bush and this money behind so there were quite a few questions about impairment in germany that so for law enforcement there um the biggest issues that we've gotten i know you're trained specifically in this i provide postcards i'd love to do this uh explain this to law enforcement compare motor coordination slowly increase singular focus um make it uh a challenge for people to drive the problem is that we have no 0.08 we do not have um a way to determine intoxication roadside other than what would call a tre drill recognition expert which is a long official specifically trained to recognize this occasion so the method of ingestion also makes uh testing very very very in and probably the world's thought leader a brilliant um uh woman by the name of maryland uh has told me that in all likelihood i will not see um a solid way to test intoxication uh in my lifetime because it's so complicated so colorado settled on uh five nanograms per milliliter in your blood as intoxicated however we have multiple examples of people with 15 milligrams stone colds over and an example actually right down the street from my old ass of a young man who was um two uh nanograms per milliliter who controlled a six-year-old crossing the street and drug her forever who was stoned out of his board and he was half of the legal limit so we have not figured out how to do a job of um actually testing this and we're quite a way a ways away from it so here are a few resources for you if you're interested in the politics of it there's sam the national institute for drug abuse is not um sansa smart colorado's group parents who attempt to track data and i would say that there are lots of other and use a critical eye with all of them because the politics of this are insane and what i will kind of leave you with is just because something has been politicized doesn't make application my opinion here is that this is a public health conversation and it's been it's been made into the political realm uh but it's really this is a conversation that should should be um taking place with more public health eye and if you're interested in a not so great book um but one that's maybe i think it's important it's not really well written um i wrote a book on this and it's a simon schuster brand so here are your things and i'm going to stop sharing an attempt to answer some questions take a breath and i really want to thank our attendees for hanging in we we really apologized for the audio i know it was consistently choppy ben i'm sorry to tell you um but but thank you all for hanging in there with us we do have a couple of questions that i want to get to quickly um and by the way dr arkoush has to jump off right about now so um thank you val i think you're still here with us right now but thank you so much for being here um we really appreciate it thanks kim and thanks ben really really interesting and eye-opening so appreciate your time and all your efforts take care everybody thank you doctor thanks so much all right so ben can you have decriminalization without legal first let me stop and say it is 9 30. if you have to leave us um i'm going to go ahead and put that link uh to the follow-up page in the chat boxer judy can you do that for me actually if you can put the chat to everyone um find the link send the the hyperlink out to everybody um for the lead page conversation dot zone i'll do that thank you uh so bad can you have decriminalization without legalization for recreational use yeah vermont did it dc did it um yeah for sure great uh can you remember well hang on before you do the next one let me just say that a lot of states have a de facto decriminalization colorado um possession of up to two ounces was uh a hundred dollar citable offense if anybody did it so yes you can absolutely have decrement without commercialization great great okay um can you repeat the name of the cannabis and psychosis study and and actually maybe what i we can say too is somebody else asked if we can share your powerpoint on that follow-up page and i know that your answer is going to be yes because you always say yes um so we can make sure but do you know the study that she's that they're referring to yes um the biggest and most interesting is called the effects of high potency cannabis on psychosis originally published in the lancet journal february 2015 volume two number three and it has been since updated annually got it you are crystal clear now i think it was the sharing for some reason yes okay um ben is the relationship to these mental health risks casual or causal it's both um it's it's both uh well one you'll never fully be able to isolate if it's um causation or correlation uh for all of them but there are several of them that we have absolutely isolated as causal um and the correlation is um something that's being worked out on on both of them um think about it this way what we have determined uh to be true in our world as a person uh this this tends to make these issues much louder um if they don't cause them it makes them louder but we have seen um in in the biggest study that was looked at in the last couple of years a quarter of all of the psychosis isolated was isolated as causal all right thank you someone has asked what they can do to affect the decision regarding legalization in the state of pennsylvania don't know talk to somebody who knows more about politics than me contacting elections obviously right okay um can you explain the dui requirements for marijuana i've heard that if any amount is in your system regardless of being from weeks ago you can still get a dui and i know we have some law enforcement folks on if anyone wants to reply to that not not in colorado so you actually have to um it was a uh five nanograms per milliliter was what we decided on in colorado but that's been so successfully fought in court so many times that now you got to be really impaired and realistically people just aren't um charging for that if there's anything else law enforcement can charge with they're they're doing that because um it's so hard to get a conviction for this um so no we we don't have a sound 0.08 okay great um pennsylvania is looking to allow legal thc to bring in tax money to help with loss of money due to covid what i've read in states that that uh the state of colorado is not making money off of thc less than one percent of the state income is from thc but they spend more money on police regulations and other expenses your thoughts please well um less than half of a percent actually and i i've written fairly extensively about this you cannot tax a vice substance you cannot tax any vice substance to a level that you will pay for the um societal costs associated with it we can't do it with booze we can't do it with tobacco with alcohol for every dollar we tax nationally we lose about nine with tobacco for every dollar we tax we lose about 11. you can't do it so this is this is where the politics of this get incredibly frustrating to me because it's people like well let's make money let's make money um you're stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime and it's not about making money in fact our governor uh governor hickenlooper former governor said multiple times no state ever should do this for the money because there's not actually money in it yes you will see more money coming into the coffers but it's going to cost you so much more to get this done and the percentages are tiny i mean we have a furlough on um teacher raises i'm sorry moratorium on teacher raises we are um cutting services inside of our law enforcement inside of our fire departments uh inside of social services all over denver because our budget shortfalls are so significant uh and here where the state grows and all of this huge weed money no that's just that's that's hype and the politics of that are very frustrating to me when people tell you that challenge them to justify it question what does dre stand for regarding the test a drug recognition expert so that's a member of law enforcement who's been specifically trained to recognize forms of intoxication of particular substances um are there efforts to make ads targeting children illegal as they did in the 90s um this writer is old enough to remember the joe camel commercials being a cartoon and i remember that as well um any efforts to curb that well sure yeah but every one of them is met with a uh freedom of speech argument and uh there's also okay so so here's the thing there's a lot of what i can show you i could show you illegal after illegal tactic like the the selling after 10 pm for example or drive-throughs or things like this however there is simply no bandwidth to police this it's not like we've got this task force of folks who are going around in policing these 2 700 uh facilities like we we've got a handful of people inside of the marijuana enforcement division taxed with doing this so there's a pretty big difference between saying you're not allowed to do that and actually stopping somebody from doing it like for example we can't have billboards in colorado i could show you a picture of two dozen billboards uh we can't have it on the sides of cars and buses like they do in vegas if you've been there um same thing i could show you dozens of pictures of buses uh and cars with advertising on them um there's this idea that um there's always been this idea that there's this um omnipresent they out there somewhere that's going to enforce it and um right now in colorado what they're getting done doing is uh going after the high level distributors and the um organized crime that's behind this certainly not the folks who are advertising using cartoon characters that's going to take a lot a lot a lot of torque in the same way it did with tobacco what is the colorado legislature done with this information of anything in other words commissioned studies etc also is there any industrial hemp being grown not for cbd in colorado uh last question first totally tons of industrial have been grown not for cbd um interesting stuff most of it takes place on our eastern plains um not where i am which again i'm all for i recognize the difficulty of that for law enforcement and a lot of my friends in this world get pissed when i say that um but the only issue is that it um it's really it looks like a it looks like a cousin that makes trouble for law enforcement so the fact that it looks so much like weed is an issue um as far as what the colorado legislature has done we we're continually trying to to chase the car on this and the problem is that the industry is better funded and a hundred times smarter on what these these products are so they can you know make in effect subtle little changes inside of the law that any person uh you know sitting in in the chamber in the legislature might say oh that's a nice idea um and they don't really understand the practical on the ground application to it so the issue that we have here is we have allowed them to get so far ahead of us both with money and with knowledge that we're having a heck of a hard time um actually regulating these things right and then the other thing that happens is you have somebody like um our don't don't worry if you if you wait for me to um if you get angry at a political statement i make don't worry because i'll make one about the other side any moment you have people like our senator cory gardner who at the beginning of this thing was this is terrible this is a bad idea no no no no no and after about 220 thousand dollars in donations from the cannabis industry in colorado he's like wheat is awesome colorado's doing great we know exactly what we're doing here so that's the nature a lot of the times of politics as well is where the money flows um the votes go of course not to you politicians on the call you guys are well well above that i'm sure uh and we are grateful that they're with us um is there any age requirement to purchase thc products 21. and you can purchase them online isn't that correct yeah not really you can order them online and then go up and pick them pick them up um but what we've done colorado talk or california taught the world how to do this we now have um delivery options which are pretty profound so if you want to see how that works um download an app called weed maps and um look at how the delivery works because that's pretty incredible so yeah you can order them online but you still got to go to the store and pick them up got it okay um but there are other you can order paraphernalia you can order vaping products i know for sure um which a lot of times are hijacked and used to put in the thc oil but not the cannabis product you're saying um are lawful are lawsuits starting to be filed against the industry for damages or injuries from marijuana use yes um there have been several wrongful deaths um there have been um property value losses um employment issues yeah for sure uh you know there's an old adage uh that sometimes you have to let the wolf kill the fox and um the wolf in this case i think would be um trial lawyers and lawsuits it's the way we got through to the tobacco attorney um the the fox here is the industry behind it so ultimately yes ultimately we have to end up squaring up with this in the same way that we did with tobacco but we're not going to get there any other way than lawsuits i don't think which is i guess the american way right yep um so we had one we had several advanced questions many of them you've covered um i you may have touched on this i apologize if i missed it how much thc is sold black market compared to shops that are taxed in colorado i'm afraid to ask an impossible question to answer because the nature of it is that it's it's black market and it's underground um so we we don't know that but we know that the black market in colorado is considerably larger larger than it was pre-legalization um pbs did a great study on it and npr did a great piece on it lots of people have done pieces on it it's easy to find um we don't know i think that uh i could make a guess on that but um i'm not going to do it in a public format right here's a really great question exactly how has the legalization affected youth use despite the age restriction in colorado recently a student tried to argue that if it were legal it would decrease the rebellion of youth use that seems like a um cute idealistic thing that a child would say i have three of them myself i could hear that argument coming from them uh and in reality the lower the perception of risk the higher the youth use i mean we have almost 100 years worth of um survey data that shows us that that uh that sounds that actually sounds like a kid that kind of wants to get high um the the issue always is the the less perceived harm the more they use and when you have dispensaries on every corner and when you have advertisements that you see everywhere i mean like the last broncos game i went through and went through with the kids and there literally was a plane flying over the stadium with uh uh weed advertisements behind it like yeah good luck convincing kids that it's um not a good idea then um you're no the youth use in colorado has uh is considerably higher than the rest of the country the youth use in colorado has gone up considerably since we legalized the last thing uh the the place i would direct you to would be the last monitoring the future survey um kim you're giving me some great ones but they're all kind of softballs isn't there anybody who's frustrated or has some like uh let's see they're challenged yes rebecca it's monitoring the future so right okay so can you provide a source for the increase in youth use you just mentioned monitoring the future but i'm wondering too um you know we've heard about studies that show that in states where it's legalized some studies are saying that youth use has gone down and other studies say that youth use has increased can you speak to that um yeah there's a pretty big difference between a study and a survey and between the okay so for example um one always has to look to the real science of this that's why i like to give them all a minute there was some um there was some talk at the beginning that the numbers had gone down in colorado uh the great david that's a wonderful resource to hide one um in reality the survey that they did in colorado that they showed fairly stagnant numbers of youth use had excluded all of metro denver as well as all of boulder um whereas the ones before hadn't done that so the parts of the um state with high obviously the highest use rates um so uh one of the things that we don't do a great job of in this country is reading the fine print you know we see ahead and we're like oh fantastic actually take a look at the methodology behind that is probably a good idea great um i just shared that hide a report with um all of the attendees so that's in the chat box could this become the new or will this become the new form of medication-assisted treatment um well no because matt's got science behind it uh and that is something that's actually prescribed by physicians we're saying matt we're talking about uh buprenorphine and vivitrol and things like this this is a a non-prescribed only recommended substance that we know very very little about now maybe to the core of your question is uh or at least from my perspective the core of it is are people substituting um the answer to that is yes for sure you've got a lot of folks who are um stepping down to thc if you will for those of us who work inside of chemical dependency though um we don't like seeing people transfer because it's not about the specific substance it's about the feeling and the escape and the dopamine and the etc um if you quit a drug and just start another one um a lot of times you miss the core right and i think too you know we one of our presenters uh in july was uh joe garberly who's the medical director at karen treatment center and he he was sharing with us that he does an entire presentation about how the fact that that marijuana use as a harm reduction for cannabis use sorry for opioid use disorder is is absolutely not effective in fact increases um opioid use in his in the studies that he's viewed so um it's it's very true and for those of you in the northeast in the mid-atlantic who've been hit harder than the rest of us with the opiate crisis um you gotta under like we we have macro level data that is valid and intense and um you actually uh at the individual level you actually prime opiate receptors towards misuse okay so um the more thc you invest the more you're sort of priming your opiate levels to do something wrong and when you when you look at it on a macro level like when you look at societal level data the more thc is used the higher the the abuse of opiates is so this isn't something and this is what's just triggered me out so much as everybody's doubling down on this like okay the opiates are getting worse that means we have to decriminalize legalize let these things out there that um whereas it really should be the other case um kim i saw a question pop up and i didn't read the whole thing but it was from a dare officer and if i could answer any questions for a law enforcement i'd love to do that yep it's uh where did it go i'm looking in my feed uh is dare still being taught in schools in colorado is le trying to use trying to still educate students the dangers of thcs law enforcement so educating students about the danger of thc use nope uh in boulder county dare hasn't been taught for two years and we actually three years and last year this was awesome i actually asked my daughter to um record her drug education classes because they've got their ipads and their everything and um we don't deliver an abstinence message for kids in my county anymore i can't speak to the specifics of others i go to a lot of different counties and do it but there is no um you shouldn't do drugs message in my county anymore which is uh because kids shouldn't do drugs period anything that's not uh anything that's going to alter that brain chemistry that's not a well understood medication prescribed and supervised by a physician should not be going into a pre-myelinated frontal lobe ben smoking is linked to the increase of relapse would you agree that this is the same with marijuana use yes okay issues that someone uh who knows you is running into in somerset county is the idea of you thinking marijuana is not dangerous it's a medicine you know and lots of times parents aren't educated in fact oftentimes parents are consumers and that's my ad add-in do you have the same attitudes in colorado making prevention work difficult as there are so many surveys in instead of science published and gaining attention yeah totally um totally and i i mean frankly listen i'm not trying to sell it because i think i make a dollar every time somebody buys one but that's a part of why i wrote the book is i've got some specific stuff in there on it um but yes we absolutely have to change the way that we discuss and engage with young people uh because they've gotten a different message right we're going to try to get through there we have some more in the q and a box here how has legalization impacted the use of other substances uh colorado has never recorded higher numbers than the last five years uh look at our overdose numbers look at our amphetamines but uh so this is one that causation or correlation nobody can answer that uh you know from an addiction standpoint poly substance abuse is a really really big thing but then again i've got pretty tremendous sample group bias working inside of a treatment facility it's been good for our business right can you discuss horizontal and vertical integration and if pennsylvania were to legalize which would you think would be best for pennsylvania given the current state of the industry within the commonwealth of pennsylvania so i don't know anything about the state of the industry inside of the commonwealth but um i'm not a big fan of seeing vertical integration horizontal on the other hand listen i like small tiny not well funded corporations behind these things and the more vertically or even horizontally integrated you get the more money you stockpile so like i'd mentioned before i would much prefer to see an environment that was purely mom-and-pop and purely inside of the communities in which they live if the people who owned the dispensaries in my communities lived here i think they would look and smell very differently so um i would be a fan of doing anything that you could to wake up something really just went you have another device on okay try that again try talking again sorry it just got really you're okay now yeah that was weird sorry okay i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you no not at all i was done i was just rambling okay you got really quiet now i wonder what's going on with your audio okay um all right here's a question is there an opportunity for pennsylvania implementation to have better outcomes because of first implementing medical marijuana and the use of the medical model as the starting point for recreational use or recreational model of course and and i mean colorado had medical first of course there is but the and what i wrote in my book uh is that if you're going to have a better outcome you have to build the infrastructure prior to this ex post facto law um cannot work so the the the fact that i i would guess that most people don't even understand what's inside of all of the legislation that will be voted on is a big issue like to do this right i i was over in new zealand last year um with with their uh um mps and their their lawmakers and things considering how they could do this well and responsibly and intelligently and it could be done but but you're sure not going to do it with the legislation that you got now because i've read it and it shouldn't be written by lobbyists in the industry there that's about as much politics as i like getting into okay got it are we able to prosecute for illegal use such as parents who allow children to use child and family services um didn't respond in regard to a 15 year old using yes of course you are you you can but um again it's a matter of bandwidth sure right um so i know that you have to be on another meeting at 10 o'clock so um and i know we still have some other questions so i'm going to ask folks to please join us on october 15th um submit any other questions you have that you would like ben to answer to me on the email that is on actually judy if you want to put my email in the chat box again that would be great um and uh and also the follow-up page you know we have a lot we're going to be we're going to and visit that frequently we're going to continue to build it we'll continue to add information um about other questions that come in so that we can share that with everyone and um and also please visit the section called who knew and our on our website we have a lot of data a lot of research that's gone into understanding this especially the impact on kids which what is what today's program is really and truly all about um so we really encourage you to visit that as well and i cannot thank you enough and and i apologize again to everyone for the confusion with the sound and technology you know we're trying um you're such a friend thank you so much for joining us again as always take your stomach", "WDgDnNerFqY": "welcome to diy or die today i want to talk about cloning this is the third episode in the cloning series today we're going to get into some actual mixing something that i know you've been looking forward to so here we have jam monsters pb and j strawberry and we're gonna try and get as close as possible we can to this e-liquid now in this episode we're going to break down batching and what batching is is essentially the first process of configuring your recipe to get to a point that puts you on the right direction now if you haven't watched the last two episodes i implore you to watch the last two episodes because they are imperative to understanding the next process that is batching if you don't know what defining characteristics are if you don't understand how to properly look and evaluate your e-liquid that you're trying to emulate then this process is not really going to help you so make sure you go back and you watch the first two videos now batching to put it more simply is just making different batches of the same profile the purpose of this is you can narrow down your recipe hunt you can narrow down your development to get to a point that puts you on the right path so in this particular case we have jam monsters pb j strawberry here we have identified our defining characteristic which is that combination between the strawberry and peanut butter that really makes that tick it's sort of like a jammy strawberry it's a little sticky it's sweet and then you get you know a pretty vibrant peanut butter uh on the finish so now that we know what the defining characteristic is we can take that and batch it out so we can try to really hone in which path to go down where we're going forward we're going to start to add in our accents and finish the recipe so here we're basically trying to figure out what pair of flavorings or what combination of flavorings gives us that defining characteristic and obviously you can't do this in just one go you're not gonna be able to vape something and then immediately go oh it's this flavoring in this flavoring you're going to need to do some batching where you're gonna take the recipe and just split it up across a spectrum of profiles that are within the realm of your defining characteristic so here we have the strawberry and peanut butter defining characteristic and here i have three different types of batches that will that i think are gonna get us to that defining characteristic they're all across the spectrum though so for instance this first batch we have tf is dx peanut butter we have flavor arts juicy strawberry and we also have capella's sweet strawberry so what i was trying to do with this particular batch is get like the most basic generic strawberry peanut butter blend right capella sweet strawberry with flavor art strawberry is a common strawberry blend here i wanted to add that with the most common peanut butter which is the dx peanut butter and what makes sense about this particular batch is that you know commercial companies they want reliability they want flavor houses that are going to always be in stock that have a really good distribution network that are just always reliable and also have good prices so that's why you always want to kind of look at the main flavoring companies when you're going with your batching or your recipe development now here in batching we want like a wide spectrum so we can kind of pick and choose where to go and really refine down the recipe and that's the first batch now the second batch we have one-on-ones strawberry jam chem nevadex strawberry and we also have tfa peanut butter the nandy version just regular tfa peanut butter and in this particular instance i'm utilizing two sort of left-field strawberries right one-on-one strawberry jam you don't really see it in many recipes because it's not the most popular strawberry but it does have like a jammy deep strawberry flavor so i kind of want to see if it's close to anything that is in the original and the same kind of goes with the chemnovatic it's kind of got a stickier jammier flavor though it is brighter than the one on one strawberry jam and then the tfa peanut butter uh mainly because it's just like the standard peanut butter so it would either be that or the tfa dx peanut butter in this case i just wanted to choose the different peanut butter the difference between the two is the dx version is a little bit thinner but it's still just as textured it's still just as flavorful and the reason you choose dx over the over the non-dx is that it lasts a little bit longer and then our last batch here we have wonder flavors strawberry baked and we also have flavora peanut butter yes flavor peanut butter which is a little bit more of a natural peanut butter and just a little bit more uh has kind of like an earthier note to it so i want to say when you're going about your batching you're probably going to do many more batches than this i'm just doing three just for the sake of the video but you would probably do along the lines of like i don't know a thousand two thousand batches like this is a long arduous process this is the most difficult aspect right once you have a defining characteristic translating that into flavorings is very very tough and that's where it's going to take a really long time so we have the more sort of mainstream strawberry peanut butter blend we have one with a few different strawberries and then the other one we kind of have one completely left field right so we're covering that spectrum all right so let's get mixing here let's do our mixing we have dx peanut butter at four percent and remember this is mainly to give it a little bit more longevity as opposed to the original tfa peanut butter which is arguably better in flavor but not necessarily in vapor experience and then that simple strawberry base blend that we have where juicy strawberry at two percent um which is gonna help give it some brightness and then we have capela's sweet strawberry here at four percent to just fill out the rest of the profile the rest of that strawberry easily one of my favorite strawberries to use i i always have like six of these little 30 mils now when you're doing batching and you're doing testing i always get asked should i add super sweet i think you should because it's going to just if you're going to put it in your final recipe well then you might as well put it in your tester so you can understand how the sweetener or the sucralose reacts with your recipe and with your bases especially with your defining characteristic which is what you want to be really accurate right now someone also asks i always get this should i add nicotine to my final or to my testing batches and i would say yes to that as well mainly because without it there is a slight difference in the way that the vapor feels you know it's not necessarily the flavor that gets affected but you'll notice a pretty big difference in saturation and vape experience without even one percent which is what i use in my testing it's what i use here now something also to keep into consideration is steeping right so when you're steeping your batches you want to make sure you're keeping note of that sometimes what i'll do is i'll make a bunch of batches and i'll forget to write down the date that i mix them at so when i try them later i'm like oh man how many days have it has it steeped because sometimes that steeping does matter should you always steep your batches you know it really depends on the profile with custards and tobaccos probably you know when you're going for your defining characteristics but with other fruit blends or if you're more of an experienced mixer and you can tell how a steep is going or you can tell how a profile is going you probably don't really need to steep it that long now we have our second batch here which is tfa peanut butter at five percent and this is um going to really give us all the peanut butter flavor we need you really kind of want to push your peanut butters a little higher especially tfa peanut butter mainly because it does fade a little bit again that's why i was using the dx the other one with this one we're going to go five percent because it might fade over time the chemist strawberry here at four percent so it's a higher percentage um base here and um this is a newer flavoring right this is not a flavoring that you're gonna see in a lot of recipes but that's why it's good to batch it you wanna know where it's at you want to know me hey maybe they did maybe they had some sort of secret contract or something you know we have our strawberry jam at two percent which gives us a little bit of that sticky strawberry flavor and now we have our last batch here which utilizes flavor peanut butter at two percent which i don't necessarily think it's gonna be close but again you want you want to batch you want to cover all your bases just in case maybe something pops up something special or something uh unique and that's kind of where you're going to find that defining characteristic you just never know you also want to know how far off you are you know you want to know how how far off is this batch maybe we'll you know take something uh from it and here we have the strawberry baked at four percent also try to get your percentages spot on you know um try not to be a little over or a little under you really want to this is the most important part so you really want to uh to maintain a lot of accuracy and don't trying to rush through it like i'm doing here all right we have all three of our batches mixed up and before we start to test them let's just go back to our desktop here and let's just make notes right let's just make sure we put down what type of notes we need okay we're going to go down to our recipe notes we have to make the date here right so november 19th 2020 and then we're going to put whatever it is our notes are for the first batch maybe you didn't have tfa dx peanut butter and you used a different one that was something that i don't know you didn't expect to be in there it's just good to know like writing tfa dxpb was not yet available but could be useful stuff like that you know just mark everything down stay organized make sure you're dating everything make sure you're just being completely uh detailed with all of your processes with all of your tasting notes and with just the the entire thing you know it's only going to help you and what's great is that after years and years of your mixing you're gonna have this library of notes and library of experiences and just just a gigantic encyclopedia of mixing knowledge that you can constantly go back and reference to and you don't have to keep that all mentally all right here we go we're going to do our testing i do want to make a note uh it's a sort of you know do as i say not as i do type thing but when you're going about your batching it's a good idea to swap your cotton out you don't want to really keep the same cotton when you're testing between flavors sometimes you do though sometimes you do but for the most part you might want to have three different builds or be ready to to wick a few times because sometimes those subtle differences start to blend and it's really hard to tell what recipe is giving you what um but again in this case uh do as i say not as i do i'm just you know trying to speed this up for the sake of the video so here's our first batch to me this is already pretty much right on the mark of what the original tastes like which is a good start right because that's going to allow us to understand oh [ __ ] we're on the right path we are on the right path we've made the correct decision in identifying the defining characteristic and now all of it is a matter of refinement and balance and making sure we get the right ingredients to do the job and we hit the right percentages so in terms of the first batch with the sweet strawberry and the uh flavor art strawberry we're pretty dang close already like it's pretty nice already now it's always a good idea to to always get a little reference so going back to the original and just testing the original against your batches so there's something a little bit deeper about the original something a little bit more saturated less bright it's just kind of a little bit lower on the palette so let's go and let's test the third batch which is the flavor peanut butter with wonder flavor strawberry here strawberry baked and let's just see where this one falls in line and we'll see how close or how far away we are with this specific blend and this one is just too deep right it's bringing it too far down the peanut butter is a little too prominent the strawberry is just a little too deep and not quite as sticky and sweet and bright as it is in the original so we've kind of went too far on the other end of the spectrum now we're gonna have to pull ourselves back and go towards the more of the center now we're gonna try our second batch here and our second batch in my opinion is the closest one i'd say it's between the first and second batch where the the original profile sort of resides and what that means to me is that all we really need to do is figure out the rest of the recipe the rest of the accents and try to just enhance what that defining characteristic is to push it towards whatever is uh is giving this the flavor that it's giving it we figured it out right we've got our defining characteristic we've did our batches we've landed on uh kind of where we need to go and what we need to kind of do to get us to the promised land the next step is putting in the accents the next step is building out the full recipe and putting pretty much filling in the spots that are lacking from what the original is giving so hopefully this helped you out hopefully this helped you in your batching processes and remember that the batching process is the longest process this is what's going to take a really long time it's also going to take a lot of resources buying all the different ingredients that are available testing them pairing them all up is a very intensive process so just be ready for that but just know that this is where like that 70 to 80 of your is going to come from it's going to come from this specific part the rest of it you know that an extra 20 to 30 percent that's going to come from finalizing the recipes finalizing those percentages and finalizing those accents and that'll be the next step putting in the accents building the rest of the recipe out and the step after that will be finalizing it making sure everything is refined and that'll conclude the cloning series

but very popular aspect of vaping C B D what is CB d now CBD which is an abbreviation of canna video is a completely legal non psychoactive extract taken from the larger cannabis plant now unlike the illegal yet far more popular tetrahydrocannabinol or THC CBD has had all psychoactive compounds stripped away from it meaning it has all of the shall we say physical effects of the plant without any of the mental effects of traditional cannabis now people have been using cannabis and cannabis derived medicines for years to treat many different symptoms however many are a little bit nervous about engaging with the devil's lettuce due to elements such as it illegality the sometimes complicated nature of procuring it wherever you are obviously you should be doing that because it's illegal and also the slightly nerve inducing or paranoiac aspects of it that many people do suffer from when trying to use it as a medicine now traditional THC operates on the body's cb1 receptors many of which are located in the brain CBD is a little different CBD operates on the body's cb2 receptors which are located primarily in the body's inflammatory system meaning that the effects of the substance are entirely physical and whilst not straying into language that I cannot use all of its effects are going to be those which operate on your body's inflammatory system so if you find you are having issues that involve inflammation CBD can be a very powerful compound now as you're probably aware by this point you are watching this video after all CBD is growing in popularity at a rapid pace here in brighton and hove alone we already have CBD specialist or CBD products told from help senses CBD dispensaries even cafes and kitchens which specialize in CBD infused cannabis and other foods containing CBD but you're here because you're interested in vaping now what would be the benefits of vaping it there are some when vaping CBD it enters the bloodstream far quicker than when ingesting it orally or using it as a topical balm this immediate and strong onset of effect can provide a lot of its users with a greater sense of control over the symptoms that they are choosing to treat with it and generally speaking when people vape it they can be very confident in the fact that they have a very determined idea of exactly what their dosages and when and how they're going to apply it now if you've chosen to vape CBD there are a couple avenues you can take some of which are related to ease of use other ones about more precise dosage and control of dosage now the easiest thing that you can do would be to purchase something like one of these ten mil pre-mixed CBD infused e-liquid by us here at mist the e-liquid clocking in at a hundred milligrams which is a fairly reasonably strong dose one that you'll certainly get the chance to feel and a great way to experiment with the subject with the substance without having to worry about it being too strong too weak anything like that using something like this all you would need to do is purchase yourself a simple mouth to lung kit or some kind of POD system and then like usual just go about filling it the way that you normally would no complication to it and those strangeness and like usual just pop it in the side and fill up to about the top of your window I do specify the use of a mouth to lung machine like this because the majority of pre-mixed CBD II liquids are going to be very PG heavy they're rarely very thick however there are as an alternative we would recommend these these are what we refer to as CBD booster shots these are effectively CBD top-ups all you would need to be doing is getting an empty tank popping in something like two to four to six droplets of this substance in there and then just filling it the rest of the way with your favorite eliquid these booster shots generally are going to be a little bit pricier than the pre-mixed ones but this is because they are going to last you these are far stronger coming in 500 milligram and a thousand milligrams spectively you will need to be adding this by the droplet now don't worry about getting nervous about measurements here on our website just type in CBD calculator we have a very simple to use robust system that will take a few details from you like how much CBD do you have let's say 10 mils of it how strong is it let's say 500 milligrams grant how big is your tank probably a 2 mil tank if you bought it in the UK and then what's your preferred daily dosage and then you just type that in hit the button that will instantly tell you how many drops of CBD booster to add to your tank so as to infuse it and infuse your favorite a liquid with your daily dosage now there are a couple different varieties of CBD that are used in a liquid and the mist range uses a particular one known as full-spectrum CBD as opposed to the previous industry standard of CBD isolate CBD isolate is painstakingly extracted from the plant and it's an extremely pure process they just take the absolutely necessary CBD from the plan the CBD we use here at mist is referred to as full-spectrum CBD full-spectrum as a post isolate takes everything it legally can from the plant so as to give you the most possible good in your substance we hope we've given you some good explanation as to the ease of vaping CBD today if you would like some more info please come on down to any of our retail locations for a good in-depth chat about your personal circumstance and how CBD could be of help to you we have a lot of customers who just come

not satisfied", "bKr5cDLNnZE": "hey everybody it's me from really here and we are back with the introduction first episode of cycle 9 growing four extracts I'm really excited to bring this serious you guys and not only the videos but of course the garden here check this out four tables nice fully scrubbed out we've got a total of 15 plants in this garden the only table that has three is the one in back there and before we get to strains let's just take a quick walk walk around the garden here give you guys kind of a good look see before we really dive into what we're doing here and this garden has been setup for quite some time and we've ran a couple cycles in here but this is going to be the first cycle at really full capacity full automation or at least as much as you know we've done it so far and really some great strains in here so let's go ahead and get to it first we'll cover that cover the lights we have in terms of the hoods themselves and height and an extra Sun hood from Hydrofarm this was one amazing Rouge original hoods it's a little bit smaller in terms of the square footage I guess for the hood itself but it really puts out some pretty intense lighting in a really focused area you can't even see it there a little bit more dark over here whereas like this area is getting a lot of light and then we have this Sun system hood and this one definitely as you can tell has a little bit bigger footprint and also on the plants themselves you can kind of see doesn't really have quite the dark spots over here that that one does now grow vows and green jeans and those guys will tell you to use like a par meter or something like that or maybe even a lumen meter to really kind of figure out where your lights are and how much you know kind of like you're putting out in different areas of your canopy unfortunately I do not have one of those so I kind of have to rely on a my experience with these bulbs and you know how long they last what they really should look like maybe not naked eye but to the the method seven eye if you will and then you know kind of what the canopy it looks like and it's sometimes it's hard to tell what the canopy looks like especially if you're not wearing glasses like these but when you shoot it through a white balance video like we're doing here it's a lot easier to tell so going over to these hoods these are also Sun system hoods but they're the low-profile ones and you get about five and a half inches more space out of these ones compared to that one so this is just like the newer version there's a magnum like xxx owls or whatever they are all eight inch hoods but as you can see up here this is like an oval in your exhaust and your intake for it it's still round insulated 8-inch ducting but you just kind of flex it from that round to that oval and it fits right on there I don't really noticed any like reduction in CFM's or anything there might be a minor difference but I think it's really pretty much the same kind of space or you know hold that you have to go through in terms of like your total area of the the hole so they're working out pretty well and since we have about five and a half inches more space on this side I put the stretchier plants on this side and then the kind of less stretchy kind of shorter squatty maybe indica plants on this side and of course last but not least is you see in the center here and you know it's not a light mover and you think it'd be pretty easy to avoid if it wasn't on a light mover but it's sitting at about oh maybe like five foot you know six foot right in that gentle range right where my face is all the time so especially when I'm like working down here and the reservoir is that I go to stand up i clunked my head on it a few times so really gotta kind of get used to that one but we have been running kind of this central metal halide lighting for a couple runs I did it in the early farm even and I have mentioned that we kind of typically do it the last couple weeks to really boost the production of the cannabinoids and finish out the plants but I'm actually gonna be running it this entire cycle all the way through now it's not on 12 hours a day right now it's only on like nine ten hours a day and I'm slowly boosting it up to full lot edge I think it's actually already at a thousand watts right now but these are all on super lumens mode or you know the ballast boost or whatever you want to call it and they're rocking about eleven hundred and forty watts each or so last time I checked them with the wattage meter I mean none it recently but you know assuming they're still kicking around 11:40 if we take all the lights together we should be running around fifty six to maybe fifty seven hundred watts in this garden when everything is said and done so it's pretty decent amount of lighting you know we don't have any any plants in the center here yet that's not to say we won't we're definitely getting plenty of cross lighting between these four hoods and of course the sensual metal halide which by the way those are all HP S Plus bulbs so they're all HP s and the hoods but this one's the thousand watt metal halide from Porter Lux yeah so there's plenty of lighting and I really do want to take advantage of the space here it's just gonna be a matter of basically pulling out those plants every time I need to you know mess with the reservoirs or if I have to get back in the corner or something like that could be problematic so if I can manage to fit even a couple small plants in here I probably will so you may see that coming but again we're only at day three here now and things are already starting to look pretty luscious all right so let's go ahead and well let's go ahead and take a look at the ballast here so behind me on the other wall here we have our ballasts you'll notice we have our three galaxies grow amps I've been using for those for quite some time they work really well they have that kind of super lumens or boost mode if you go they call it turbo charge is what they call it so they're adjustable they're digital and I really haven't had any like problems with interference or anything like that this one is going kind of along with the extra Sun hood over there is the solace tech ballast so this is one of our older ballasts as well whereas at least two of these are pretty new possibly three of them I know we filled out the other room first but I know I still had balance to bring over so I think maybe one or two of them are new and I think that ones maybe the old one or something like that but in any case those are all again rocking at that kind of turbocharged super lumens mode in terms of exhaust I mentioned it a little bit already that's all eight inch ducting that's going through the entire system here our exhaust itself is coming through this 8 inch by I think it's like a 36 inch or something can light filter so let's call it 8 inch by 3-foot filter that's like 800 to a thousand CFM's somewhere in that range so plenty big enough for this max fan pro series 8 inch fan and that's on a controller that Titan controls controller we'll take a look at in a second but you can see I only have it set to 2 and it's adjustable from off and then slow medium and fast so this will give you kind of different CFM and since it's on an automated controller I want it on a somewhat slower mode that way I can kind of slowly move the hot air out versus pumping it full of cold air real quick I think when it comes with like maybe later in the cycle when it gets a little bit warmer due to just the weather conditions outside here in Michigan I think that I will probably maybe either have to turn I'll probably have to turn that up higher just to get out the exhausting hot air what we are doing kind of a two-room split here and we do have booster fans that are exchanging air in between the rooms and we're only gonna have lights on in here while the lights on in there are off and then vice versa so we won't be like blowing out of this entire room with a lot of heat or anything and here's the other one but I did I did turn it off just for the sake of this video because these things are pretty darn loud so so that's our 8-inch kind of exhaust we got a wide splitter here and then it just gets routed through each side and then it comes out and gets connected to another Y and then gets exhausted now our intake is back here that is also a the same 8 inch max fan pro series fan along with a same can light filter the 8 inch by I believe 36 inch and that's rockin also at the kind of medium speed and it's not set up to the tight controls like environmental controller that we got over there it's actually set up on its own set for one controller these things are really awesome if you guys just need a little automation or basically aren't growing in a tent but aren't big enough to like have fully automated room this is almost necessary to kind of get that step in between so as you can see in the daytime it's set to go off at about 78 degrees and the night time it goes off at about 81 82 degrees and yeah it just keeps the if it gets that warm then it brings in the cool air from outside now I've thought about kind of putting it or connecting it to this so that the intake and the exhaust go off at the same time which really is what I should be doing but I've got to run some like electrical because it's gonna take some extension cords and stuff to kind of connect the two because it's on the same controller it's on this cooling output outlet so you can see up here I have it set to go about 78 79 degrees the fan will turn on and then this is the humidity control so this this kind of just controls the temperature not independent of day and night so it's kind of you know I can't have that extra change in temperature with the day/night so I don't know I'm still figuring that but right now it's everything's running pretty smoothly and of course we got our humidity monitor there and that's I've got it set up to a dehumidifier which is right here and this will just auto run so continuously run as long as that turns it on so it's not set to any certain humidity level or or high or low or anything like that it just turns out and runs as long as this allows it to turn on and so I've got that set to about 60 62% so if our humidity in this room gets up to 62% that'll turn on is just bring it down to that or below and then I'll turn it off in the other room we have a humidifier and that's going to be blowing you know mist into that room and then again with the exchange of the booster fans back and forth it'll kind of allow us to find some sort of even spot between the two or maybe ideal spot is the right word but over there I wanted to use the humidifier well it's been a while since I've actually had to deal with this camera turning off I mean after like 10 or 12 minutes or whatever that was because I haven't done this kind of hoji style like I used to do I kind of got this style from eddy cropper and some other growers here on YouTube but you know I've really kind of enjoyed doing the voiceovers and a little bit more higher production value in my opinion but I know a lot of people have requested this style kind of just the walk through some of you in the grouchy Roundtable panelists have mentioned how they kind of miss that old style video so I figured you know what the last cycle is all in 4k it was all kind of a lot of point of view stuff so we head that down but this time we're we're gonna go we're gonna rock with this 1080 use my Canon camera may be a variety of different lenses probably get some more photos than I've been taking you know kind of the entire process and better shots of the trichome productions and stuff like that with the macro lenses and I'll post that out an Instagram app for goalie but yeah we're gonna we're gonna rock this old style so with that for those of you new subscribers my camera only films for about 10 or 12 minutes and HD before it cuts out I know a lot of the new cameras go a lot longer than that but this camera is years and years old I've been using it for a long time and you know I've got the best SD card that's currently available you know some 64 gig like super extra speed whatever you know not just the reading speed but the write speed as well and that's just all I'm getting out of it so until I get a new camera or something else DSLR wise or other I'll probably just be rocking this thing probably at least the duration of the cycle maybe even longer but I have looked at several other cameras there's a lot of sweet stuff out there but in any case I'm getting off track just figured I'd throw that in there while we kind of hit that point but back to the dehumidifier humidifier I wanted to run the humidifier in that room because I really want to like push like the weight I guess you know what I mean and I know that keeping the relative humidity really high with the vapor pressure deficit which that chart is in there you can also go to for goalie comm / VPD and check out the vapor pressure deficit chart that's something important to take a look at especially when it comes to the environment of your room it's really gonna help not only the health of the plants but the overall production so one of the things that I've been hearing and reading about in terms of the growing for extract side of things not necessarily wait is that drying the plants out or creating an arid environment at least a couple times throughout the cycle up to maybe even more once a week it's possible that it's gonna increase track home production so that's one of the things I'm looking into and one of the things I want to try and try to document but with that this dehumidifier is gonna come in really handy and I might even hook up another one in here and we'll just get the room super dry and then let it go back and then get them you know just bring them through the week and super dry and let them come back so that's kind of the idea at this point I haven't gotten there yet again we're only at day three here so I'll probably get more or less through the stretch phase before I do any kind of stressing on these plants so then maybe a little super cropping oh yeah that's where we're at with I guess the the relative humidity side of things all right so we've talked about the lights and the wattage we've talked about kind of that air flow with air movement you see this fan up here it's a I believe 18 inch I think it's a 18 inch hurricane fan it's running on medium cuz running on high will kind of hit those plants a little bit too hard but you can see it's blowing right over the canopy it's hitting that the surrounding heat from that light and then it's pushing air all throughout that canopy so nice air movement coming from that fan we've got this fan over here kind of doing the same thing hitting the tops of the canopies of both Scroggs and then a little bit maybe through - that one's running on I believe low I think it's either lower medium because we can just look yeah that one's running on low because if what's not a lot of air movement as well and it's I believe only a 16 inch hurricane but these things work pretty well the only problem with these it is on a stand so I've been kicking that thing left and right you probably heard me trip over it a few times of this video already but I do have a couple 16-inch hurricane fans that are wall fans that I could probably hang up but there's just not it's not really necessary at this point I feel like this is working pretty well this setup and then last but not least we have that box fan over there and that really is just to help the air flow and air movement from that the intake get through here because that's really the only source of co2 I'm not burning co2 in here so other than you know my mouth breathing self and the intake over there don't have really a lot of co2 in here so between all that though I think we got quite a bit of air movement seems to be plenty I don't think I'm going to add any more I don't think it's really necessary I suppose I could maybe put like a table top one over there just kind of push air back over this way or something like that but unless you know they start showing signs of transpiration problems or something like that I'm just going to leave it as is all right let's get to these strains themselves I know you guys are really wondering probably what I'm trying to grow in terms of growing for extracts I've got a decent library of strains to choose from a lot of great ones as you guys have seen on the channel and part of it was just what was available to me part of it was selecting for what I know are going to be good extracts and then a lot of it was just kind of organizing the tables together and whatnot so let's start with this back table over here because this back table is all flow Flo's a one heck of a strain it's probably one of the most equalizing strains I've ever smoked I'm not sure if we've tested it even yet but it's gotta have a decent amount of like CBD or CBG or maybe not crazy amount of THC but it's really really nice strain and definitely like kind of at any time of the day smoke really very therapeutic and you know we got four pretty sizable plants of it in here I believe all in five gallon pots actually you know what looks like those back to my yeah I think the back to our three gallon pots the front to our five gallon pots but the back two are actually a little bit more veg so that'll be interesting to see how these kind of compare and some of these some of these plants were put in here pretty quickly after being transplanted and only given a couple days of veg time under these lights and then kind of went straight into flower but again we had we had actually had a couple days of engineer and that means downtime of flowering mode and I don't really want any of that but we had to fill out this canopy fill the Scroggs we did pretty dang good job out of it I'll get back to those we'll talk about pest management in IPM in a minute well yeah there's stuffy some little bugs crawling around alright to this other table right here I'm really excited about this table the flows get fairly purple so I'm really excited to see like a real nice dark table back there in the autumn flush this this table three of them this one that one and that one right there are all grape Apes and grape Apes are definitely like those shorty short squatty indica plants but super super frosty and very very purple so it's gonna be a very very purple kind of side of the room over here but last but not least in this table we have a Durban poison which is probably the most requested strain that we have and unfortunately I only have one in this room but she's nice and chunky or not chunky she's nice said like thick with the vegetation I'm glad how big she's gotten already a little nervous that she was going to be a little smaller than I wanted as you can see she's not quite filling out like the edges like kind of the rest this entire strong all the plants in it but she's nice and full I'm not gonna do a ton of lollipop being on her and she's gonna be the standout on this side of the room because she's gonna be super lime green when it comes on flush but yeah all those plants they don't stretch really much at all I expect them to maybe grow another like six inches but that'll give us you know anywhere from zero to nine inches or so above the canopy which will be plenty for just one layer of scrog nut I want to have to do a second one I think that's all I gotta say about that side it's gonna be super dark in like eight weeks or so and the flavors are just incredible the flow is pretty again it's kind of equilibrium strain really like therapeutic the great babe definitely like indica heavy heavy hitter super purple super frosty and then the dirt employees are just amazing flavors nice effects but just that chirping only in it or as I was corrected recently turpino leaned that terpene is just really amazing and pretty common in the sativa type strains we have it in our lime skunk as well I'm gonna go ahead chop this video real quick before it chops on me unexpectedly and we'll talk about this side all right guys before we get to these strains I wanted to bring something up I just realized my Instagram was blowing up I posted a picture of these three hats I now have these hats finally available because let's get in some light here at four girly calm I had a lot of requests to be able to purchase hats and we've got several different colors I've only got a few of them right here but we've got this royal blue with the white logo and that's a snapback we've got this camouflage which I'm a big fan of I might actually have to get one of these for myself my scent girl mouse one of these and I know he's gonna like it so much that whole wear all the time of course even under that giant girl mouse head of his but yeah you may not be able to see it on his channel but he's got one of those and then this white one of course like the standard one I wear on the grill to brown table this white one comes in both fitted and the snapback but they're all the the flat bill and I'm just excited to be able to share those with you guys I've had several people order them already and you know a couple of them posted on Instagram and tag me and stuff so if you do order one deftly you know throw out the you know a tag on Instagram or shout it out and whatever you know social media you guys are on take some pictures share it with everybody I appreciate the support and for as long as I have the stickers available in the next like batch or two of hats I sell because I'm doing them small batches just because that's only what I can afford like you know maybe a dozen or 15 or so at a time right now anyway I'll throw in a sticker there so I bought a bunch of us like not quite bumper stickers or like you know vinyl slaps whatever you want to call them but I'll throw you guys a sticker there the next couple batches so head on over to Furillo comm check out this hats I want to get some shirts and stuff on there soon too but the hats and the stickers are available now and I appreciate you guys support everything does help and like I mentioned I want to get a new camera so maybe that's what we'll do with those funds but right now it's just kind of going in back to ordering more hats so I appreciate you guys but getting back to these strains I'm really excited about this side too you know that side this is actually gonna be a pretty purple room come the end of flowering and into the autumn flush like I said the flow is gonna be nice and dark grapes are obviously gonna be dark dirt boys are gonna kind of stand out but in this side of the room we have a biochem and three cookies and creams so four out of the seven plants on this side are gonna go dark as well this back table we'll start here first in the back we have two cookies and cream and that's from exotic genetics and she stretches a little bit she's not I kind of wish I put this 24-carat in the back but I knew that I was gonna have to scrub her out even more so because she stretches so much initially really tries to like compete with their other branches that I'm really just gonna try to strong it out left to right and I know I had so much work to do it that I didn't want to be reaching over to other plants because it's it's kind of hard to get back there I'm not gonna lie so even with this long of a wingspan inside cot it's still hard to super crop and kind of stocks on these out but these cookies have cream in the back will will let them stretch a little bit just try not to let any one or two nodes get too much higher than the rest of the canopy but yeah cookies and cream for exact genetics super frosty not very much you know not a big producer at all but super frosty and the trim is just amazing on it so it turns axsjax it's going to be great this 24-carat as I already mentioned that's DNA genetics we've only got one of those in this room I've grown this several times we Fino hunted this it's not quite the original kosher tangi that I had but still definitely has that tangi chirps a little bit more of that kind of hash EOG or whatever is in it but she stretches like crazy like I said in the initial couple weeks of flowering you can see I've done some pretty aggressive super cropping and you know like there's another one right there super crop right at the scroll net but then we've got you know these giant branches already coming off in both of these right there are from that same super crop spot pretty much so she'll continue to be pulled out it's kind of weaved even through the scrog net and I want to keep this low enough that the cookies and cream in the back get some of this kind of side lighting here so that's the probably the stretchy astable I'm gonna have and while we slept some stretches over here they're not gonna be quite as stretchy because like this one right here this is actually a cookies and cream as well look how much smaller she is compared to those ones back there those ones are looking at like you know 20 to 25 nodes this one's looking at maybe like a like 8 to 8 it's really not that many nodes on this one so it's she's more or less a filler plant but she's gonna be getting a lot of light with the cross lighting and this lighting right here also kind of creating that bowl effect so everything around it can get the side lighting as well but she's gonna be a nice plant she'll be nice than probably nice and dense you know and a nice blood production and everything but she's just not going to produce a lot back here biochem I mentioned that already that's gonna be another one of those dark turning plants so I'll kind of goes back to this cookies-and-cream and his bio camera all gonna be nice and purple and she is one of my favorites in terms of the flower so I don't I'm definitely more of a concentrate guy but the flower on that is really good it's pretty immediate it has probably I'd say similar effects to like you know taking a small dab so I'm happy with her again not the biggest plant she'll be a decent producer and that she isn't a five gallon bucket let's go to this one first so this one right here this is chubby bunny and we actually were gonna put her on the chopping block we have a bunch of clones of her we're kind of like man like I don't even know if I really want to like use these clones for our plant cow like maybe just get rid of the chubby bunny like the first test we did on it wasn't really all that impressive but the last round we did of it that we harvested she was just like wait frost here way frost here so the floods or the floods the flowers and the buds seem to be much more potent and much better this time and I don't think we had a big enough batch of it even to to test but I will probably hopefully be testing this batch or maybe another one if we have one in the other room and I know we have plenty of clones coming so chubby bunny it's kind of our little project sort of here trying to figure out what we've got and she's going to stay for a little bit we'll see we'll see what happens over here with the extracts and another run just maybe there's something maybe just environmental or something so last but not least we have this white cross over here and I just called it white cross because we didn't really know what it was we're still not entirely certain what it is but I am told by the person that we kind of got it from the Caesar whatever that it is the white cross with critical kuch so if that's the case she should be a real nice plant we have grown her out once before but it was very small like side plant and kind of just to see what it was and now this time we're really gonna give her a nice you know boost of light and nutrients here and we'll see what happens another one that could be on the chopping block we don't have a ton of clones over or anything like that so more or less just assume what we have but that is that's well let's see four tables I think seven strains and 15 plants let's see one two three four five six eight I think H strains so maybe H strains 15 plants four tables we're gonna have some nice buds in here I'm really excited about it one thing I should mention is if they do stretch up too much you can already see they're kind of like pushing up on the scroll net there they get too high I'm ready to install another skog net for extra support so really this is these scrag Nets are kind of serve dual purpose a lot of that most of the time is mainly for support just so those buds don't flap over but the other thing is for training and not only was like like the super cropping but with just like pushing the plants under or maybe weaving them through and getting them to a point where they're held down and stretched out and you get those auxins flow into the lower nodes so that you have a nice even canopy for solid production and even light distribution now with light distribution and air movements and strains and all that kind of stuff which before I get there they're all in five or three gallon pots and either Mother Earth or with tannic air cocoa we normally just use Mother Earth straight cocoa and using that for years but they recently ran out and our girls started and it's been like a couple weeks since we've been able to get it so we had to use botanic air cocoa which I'm not a big fan of it was pretty chunky not a lie and then more recently we actually picked up several bags of the Mother Earth cocoa with perlite which is 30 percent perlite it's quite a bit especially for cocoa it's gonna be quite aerated but none of that is in here this is all just straight mother earth or botanically rococo so no perlite attic but cocoa is really good for wicking water and you know that's what we're doing here we're flooding and draining so we're feeding from the bottom now sometimes I'll do like organic top feeds especially if we're doing like a silicate silica based supplement but I haven't got there yet and I don't know if I will this might just be straight up flood and drain I might just do the extra work of cleaning these reservoirs and you know seven to ten days and just dealing with it basically that heavy workload every seven to ten days versus a little bit lighter workload but you got more work throughout the week so again I'm gonna chop the video here this is gonna be quite the long video what's this sure if is going to be a you know 12 minute 20 minute or 40 minute video but I want to get through everything here at day 3 so you guys have really good footing of what's going on here before we start seeing the blood production all right so let's talk nukes as you guys know here at the fmg canopy we run our old water so basically all the water that comes into our garden is put through a reverse osmosis system those filters are changed every six months and they were actually just changed right before this cycle so before these reservoirs were filled and so we should well I know for a fact that that water is 0 ppm s we've tried it with two different EC meters or ppm meters from blue lab and they neither of them detected any kind of electrical conductivity or PPM's or anything like that so it's a hydrologic system and it works really well and I would definitely encourage you guys that you can afford it or have the space or whatever for it to run reverses us reverse osmosis water and you guys can definitely check out those cloning tests I did some reverse osmosis for tap water tests and you know with some clone acts and whatnot and got some different results both times so kind of interesting to see the differences but these are all 4x4 flood and drain tables and these are all botanic air forty gallon resins now I used to use those black and yellow like 27 gallon totes from Home Depot HDX when you Lowe's I think has some I use them for my cloners you know those things those are great they really do last for seven to ten days probably with a you know four by four table maybe seven days that like minimum but these botanic air rez is their lower profile by like four or five inches and they also they're wider and like sturdier plastic so they actually hold 40 gallons of water maybe even a little bit more but that's what they're marked up to is 40 gallons of water this lasts or this first batch of feeding I only put 32 gallons in I may put more when necessary but I'm kind of seeing how much we're gonna actually use over the course of seven ten to ten days because I don't really want to push it to like past ten days in terms of cleaning you could do pump in dumps you know and maybe go like 14 days whatever but I really want to make sure I'm cleaning these reza's pretty much every 10 days so that's could be kind of important to me it's a big hassle though cleaning like the pumps and the reza's and the tubes and all that kind of stuff and then resetting it all back up it really is a pain in the butt but it's important to you know maintain a clean garden for obvious reasons we've talked about that even in our last cycle so each res has 32 gallons of reverse osmosis water in it I'm running an airstone in each res so there's a four hose pump over there that's pumping air through air sones medium air stones and each row is just one that's keeping the water aerated and oxygenated and then I also have a like 180 gallon I guess recirculating pump is what we call it so it is those flood pumps it's the basic water pumps or sub pumps you see at your gross store very small though they're 180 gallons and that's just mixing water through the res essentially so it's constantly moving the water not only the air stone is a little bit but it's really shooting the water around and that's just keeping things mixed up I think that's maybe not entirely necessary but it definitely helps and you know they're pretty cheap they're like 10 bucks or something like that so it'll last you at least the cycle prior to cycles so yeah give them try I mean you do have to run them all the time so I do run those 24 hours a day but the other pumps there they are four hundred gallon pumps and those are connected to the flood kit I guess the flood connection it's is a I think like half inch rubber hosing and every day in the morning half hour after the lights come on I flood each table for a half an hour with water and those pumps help push all the water up at a fairly decent rate you don't want to use something too big or too small too big you just I mean it's just too much nope it's don't point you know and can flood too quickly depending on how you know how you adjust your timers maybe just adjust your timers for the pump but I think the 400-gallon pumps are perfect for this so that's what I've been using and that's all continue to use now in terms of the newts themselves and actually so these are getting fed once a day for a half an hour right now I'm kind of waiting around and after this video I'm going to check I think they might be getting fed twice a day for a half an hour at this point and then they'll probably slow down in a couple weeks after kind of that stretch phase but right now first three days they've been half hour for a half hour after the lights come on they turn on for half an hour then drain all right so newt wise as you guys know I'm running kena nutrients again now back in this garden we've been running Houston Garden in the fmg canopy I learned a lot about Canada newts from Vader og shot up to him including flood and drain pretty much learned all about that from him but I'm gonna run Kenna newts this time instead of heavy sixteen instead of housing garden and some advanced nutrients is sort of botanic here instead of all those other things I've used in the past and we're gonna go ahead and run canna newts so I'm not going to pull all this out but the feeding that they got this week or for this rest change this first reading was per 32 gallons I'm gonna go with that we're gonna go per Red's they got two hundred and seventy five milliliters of cocoa a and B they got one hundred and seventy five milliliters of raizo tonic they got 150 milliliters of boost and those are all the can of ones now yeah I am missing a couple I actually don't have Canada's I'm yet because they were out of that at the girls store but that's supposed to be in I think like yesterday or today so I guess I could probably go pick that up so I will be getting Ken as I'm added very shortly and I feel like there's something else I'm missing but they also got some products from other companies so instead of using Canada's I'm I did use an enzyme I added sense design and that's advanced nutrients that's normally what we do use in the garden and that's what we also do in our autumn flush the enzyme portion of the enzyme carb and humic we use a sense ease I'm so I did add 200 milliliters of senses I'm to each rads but you know upon the next best chance they are going to get can design hopefully I'd like to keep the brands consistent and I I do trust and believe in Canada's I'm I have any problems with it before so there's really no point in changing that I also added 100 milliliters of cal-mag from botanic here I think I might even up that dosage a little bit next rest but that's something I'm only going to use for about four weeks and last but not least because we are growing for extracts and I'm trying to get these in flower mode basically as soon as possible which I did mention that yet but I should note that I did give them a 24 hour dark period before they went into the first day of flower so I'm really trying to initiate that flower production and while I could use like those flower initiating lights think we're kind of a little maybe a little too late to get one of those in I mean I could order it like overnight it and all that stuff and really try to blast some but I think it might be already too late for that to really get the full benefit so instead of using like any kind of flower initiators with lights I tried I decided to give another advance nutrients products they go and use but igniter so I bought a one liter bottle of but igniter and I put 250 milliliters and each Reds there's pretty much max dosage and I'm only gonna run that for a week and I'm just I'm thinking that it's gonna kind of shorten up the stretch phase a little bit because in my experience with advanced nutrients which I have run their full lineup you see that under the channel as well I did through like a drip system that was what I really first got like you know basically got out a tent so I was kind of following that I guess so maybe year two years ago probably now at least years but in any case but igniter I'm hoping just kind of quickens up the flowering stretching portion and it really gets into the trichome and blood production so that's the idea with that it is like a hundred dollar bottle so I'm not gonna use it more than one week it was kind of disappointing just watching all of that immediately go all into the res and then just be empty but you know I think it's gonna help me in the end and I think the hundred dollars will be worth it alright so that's the new for I guess this rest change I am gonna be doing our autumn flush I'll be doing you know some other stuff adding some other nutrients I don't know if I'm gonna run Hugh makes or Silica's or anything like that if I do run those two in the flowering phase that will be top feed only because those are the tubes that really like really dirty up the reservoirs and tables but I will definitely be adding buds old bat guano it's another thing we were out of right now so I couldn't add it mmediately but it'll be something that will be added probably before these resins get changed I'd like to get that in there immediately because it really does help with the flowering production and really just overall plant health it's special it's awesome it's great works really well I so the newts themselves it came about about to a 1.5 to 1.6 ICI and the res is and I just checked them before starting this video and they've got up to after 3 days now to about 6.8 East our pH so I'm going to put a little pH down in there before the next feeding and I actually I'm gonna check to see if they need to be fed twice a day so if they do I'll put it in probably as soon as I finish this video what else I guess Celestia to talk about this kind of the outlook of this grow and what the general plan is for it we're gonna start the flush a little bit early so most of these strains are kind of that eight weeks train like CNCs pretty much an eight week or grape ape is definitely an a Tweaker we've taken Durbin poison all the way to 12 weeks before but ten weeks seems to be really good for it but I'm not gonna let her go that long the flows those are pretty close to eight weeks maybe maybe push a nine but again that'll be closer to eight weeks 24-karat I mean alright so she's definitely like a late pusher I think that if I don't take like the top 20% just for the nugs I will take her early and just blast the whole plant but I you know especially with like the flow table I'm not gonna blast you know or extract a full full table like that like I'm definitely gonna save some of those nugs it's great flower but some of these like single plants and stuff I'm not I don't really have a choice unless I mix them with something else I'm gonna have to probably extract them all together because it's just not enough of it so like this white one the biochem might not even be big enough where the white should be this chubby bunny hopefully will be and then you know of course of the CNC between those three will definitely have enough but the 24-karat by itself like I might would really like to let her alright the camera got me this time but you know with this 24 I could let her go you know 9 10 weeks but I'm H I will probably have to address it when we get there but a lot of these are like those eight week strains and that'll help not only get my flush in quicker but it'll help you know kind of get these plants chops quicker that's the idea is to move them in and out and grow for extract so part of that part of the reason you chop quicker with extracts is for the color of the the resin itself if you let it mature too much you just everything's gonna go amber and I'm really trying not to harvest really much amber at all I'm really just trying to harvest clear and cloudy trichomes mostly cloudy of course but I'm not gonna be mad about clears as much as I am about the Amber's this round so people could talk about maturity of it and all that but again we're not growing for like flowers blood production anything like that I'm growing for extracts in this cycle and that's what we're focusing on and you know let's just call it growing for resin you know like we really are just trying to get those trichomes out get as many as possible and bring them to maturity as quickly as possible so that we can get them off the plant and then you know put the next plants in here at day 14 I'm gonna do the full and final lollipop so sometimes we've been going like 21 days 23 days even to do a lollipop but I and I didn't even do one as we went into the flower is that don't want to force these plants too tall I want to keep them as short as possible I don't want to encourage vertical growth I really want to encourage growth like up to the canopy so we're gonna focus on keeping the canopy low and bringing the lowers up but at day 14 I will do a full lollipop of this room and then that'll be pretty much be the final training and it'll kind of be set it and forget it other than the res is at that point now come day oh somewhere in the 40s maybe even like 41 42 maybe as far as 45 we're gonna do our autumn flush that I'm flush consists of humic acid a carbohydrate and an enzyme that really helps bring out the flowers the colors flush out the salts and you know encourages the plants to use up the sugars I really want to reduce the NPK s pretty abruptly at the end not so much taping them off for a week but really just kind of end them and then get right into feeding the sugars and everything that's left because while that might reduce the availability of the nutrients for that final push of blood production which sometimes you see in strains like really like kind of in flush almost again we're going for extracts that resin really gets produced around week 3 and 4 and matures until well I guess until harvest but again we're not trying to mature late trichomes we're not trying to go for heavy blood production so we're just trying to harvest the trichomes when they're appropriately ready after that after about two weeks of that maybe a little bit longer we'll do water only for a few days and then we will harvest so that's kind of our eight to nine week plan in this garden I'm really excited to bring this and share this with you guys you know five thousand-plus watts it's gonna be I guess I don't quite know the watts per square foot but you guys can kind of calculate that based on what you see here but yeah a lot of great strains some awesome nutrients while veg and trained plants and then a quick healthy growth cycle that's what we're looking for let me know if you guys have tried or grown any of these plants the great babe flow of course Durbin poison cookies and cream in 24 karat are gonna be poor more readily available because their DNA genetics and exotic genetics but so many as others are really just killer strains and we got told recently by the lab technician that our Durbin poisoning is in the 99th percentile for terpene volume so we're really excited about that and it definitely shows and smells so that's going to be it for this introduction to the growing for extract series cycle 9 at the fmg canopy I appreciate all almost 7,000 of you guys now subscribe to my channel I really do appreciate it just as many of you over on instagram check me out over there at furred Rolly tons of videos tons of pictures you know some other fun stuff on there too and of course check me out in for girly calm and get those stickers and the hats and every Friday night you can catch me on the grow tube roundtable on crazy degos channel at 10 o'clock Eastern Time and that runs for about two and half hours always discussing different topics bringing on awesome guests and getting over a thousand viewers concurrently and like almost 10,000 per week at this point so shout out to all you guys out there we really appreciate your support and until next time guys good luck and grow big", "UHGOd7ryTjY": "good morning everybody thank you for joining us today and for special launch of the micro granule technology in the United States so it's a first for us and we're really happy to share this moment with you with natural partners who we partnered really recently like last November so well with me and the team are really delighted to have this chance to share this with you today so let me go through the presentation of our laboratories so we are called Activa we're based out of France as a JSON just said we have a history of more than 20 years of innovation distribution of nutritional supplements our founders are doctor Patrick vorrei who you see here and it's son Amari Gray who's also our CEO and who's present in this room today facing me so we are really happy that he created this these laboratories together with your father because as you'll see we've been able to create very exciting things as I said we are headquartered in France in a little city called Cohoes house is well known for being the Silicon Valley of the nutritional supplement in our local area because you have lots of different laboratories but they are not doing as well as we are doing or for it so on as you've seen we're a family company so we're really close to our employees but also to our business partners we are looking for close relationships but also long-term relationships so this is what we're looking to creating together with you natural partners so in terms of our company's specifics we hold our own R&D our own manufacturing marketing and commercial operations why am i high lighting this because it's not the case of many laboratories who most of the time subcontract part of it the manufacturing and other parts of it we put a an emphasis on the fact that we own our own manufacturing because this is of course very important in terms of quality traceability and everything we'd put into it which I'm going to comment a bit further on our products are sold directly and through partners they are sold worldwide but in the u.s. we partner with you you're our major partners so I want to highlight this too when we sell in other countries we sell through pharmacies to most specifically in France where we started out we have our own sales force and this has enabled us to get direct feedback from the field like you get feedback directly from your own partners and your own audiences so this has enabled us to create products that answer as close as possible to market needs to the consumer needs we signed the contract with you all since last November so it's pretty fresh and some more about our mission now we develop high-quality and leading-edge nutritional supplements that provide biocompatibility and bioavailability to the human body I'll be commenting on these two concepts further on but they're very important and this is where some of our key differentiators lie our passion we are here to create the perfect symbiosis between nature and the human body it's not just a question of taking what's in nature and try to enforce it in the human body the important thing for us as we see it is to create this perfect symbiosis because you have to translate what nature is to adapt it to the human body this is where we are putting our efforts ok call it in compliance because this is also very important we work from titrated dry extracts you will understand what this is also in a minute we have to use these very difficult terms to make ourselves important and prove that we're compliant and quality compliant but no it's very important you see where it makes a big difference our products are high in trace constituents you also you will understand what I mean by this in a moment we of course trace all our active ingredients so the traceability is is very important in our company we run systematic analysis of raw material and where GMO current solvent gluten and pesticide free we use vegetable capsules in terms of compliance with FDA of course we're compliant with FDA regulations here for 21 with European directive and we are compliant with iso 9001 let me get now to our core technology and know-how i mentioned that we're working from titrated dried extract what does that mean most of manufacturers of nutritional supplements use the plants of course but they just take the whole plant they don't spend time understanding which part of the plant has the most active ingredient that you're looking for to be specifically acting on certain part of the body we do this we select the part of the plant that will specifically work where we want it to work so it takes more time more money but this is where it makes the quality that we're looking for high interest constituents of course because we take the core of the core of the core of the plant so the active ingredient is highly dosed of course we get with this up to five times more efficiency than the full plant it could be the flower the root the leaf we take what's needed to address this engine that's what we want to address let me now get to our proprietary assembly protocol and dosage that looks to be complicated but you will understand the concept in a minute we take an active ingredient and to combine it with another active ingredient instead of taking everything like most manufacturers would do all that is putting them in a bottle shaking it and producing a product we instead take the active ingredient that will when it's combined to another one potentiate each other so that it makes an active ingredient number three which we will then combine with another one and then with some others that have been combined together to also potentiate each other always together makes it a blend of multiple natural active extract up to ten plus active ingredients that we mix together according to this proprietary sonic protocol that makes it so efficient with this we get what of course synergy of active ingredients but also a global action and we can do this as many times as needed let me get now get to the micro granule because this is the heart the core of one of our key differentiators on the market why a micro granule bear in mind that it is that this is a pain patented pharmaceutical process okay so we own a patent on this and what's wonderful about the micro granule versus powder is that it enables us amongst other things to protect active ingredients and where we are able to protect in a range of 96% the active ingredients powder does not protect more than 15 to 20 percent what does that mean you swallow the capsule for micro granules the stomach the first business he wants to do is destroy everything every seize so with the micro granule we are able to protect 96% of the active ingredient so that the active that we're looking for are going to go to the intestine because this is what the surface of exchanges is going to happen powder will contribute to keeping only in the intestine 15 to 20 percent of the actives I could stop my presentation here because if you've understood this you know the difference that you can highlight to your target audience but there's more - no of course it warranties the ability of the product what does that mean well think about the level of humidity here and there it's important to not to have a mud created inside the capsule but still have the micro granules as it was initially so you keep the efficiency of it it increases the shelf life hey that's also appreciable it maps the order and the taste because even if it's encapsulated in a capsule you can still feel the taste or the order and when it comes to kids and you have to open up the capsule I can tell you to another story to try and have them swallow this with a micro granule which you can give to children starting from 36 months of age you can open the capsule put it in yogurt there's no tape no order nothing let me continue with what the micro granule enables it enables something very smart which is called chronobiology chronobiology is what we call the controlled release you can obtain anything you want with the micro granule you can decide on an immediate release on delayed release or extended release of the active ingredients you cannot get this with powder so that makes a whole difference and you see how it applies to the products we're going to highlight today so we're going to cover more of the key benefits of the micro granule and for this we have a something visual that we're going to put on the screen now so that you will understand immediately the difference with powder [Music] so that was a short video to show you that when you put a micro granule versus powder into a glass of water what's being created by the powder and the water is mud this is what happens in your intestine these little 15 to 20 percent that get to the intestine or colon do not create a large surface of exchange like the micro granule would so if you have just one point of big mud start to one part of the intestine you have a peak of action that lasts a few seconds and then it's gone and it's only 15 to 20 percent active ingredients let me remind you so let's get to what we call bioavailability of course we're talking about a high level of assimilation thanks to what remember the 96 percent release into the intestine we've protected the active ingredient thanks to the micro granule the concentration of actives thanks to the assembly protocol dosage and so forth and the greater to face of exchange which I just mentioned because a micro granule will dissipate throughout the colon and you have several points of exchange versus the slurred made by the 15% of the powder biocompatibility this is thanks to what synergy of sense because we've optimized interactivity between the different plants you remember this potentiation of each plant with each other it's also it also enables to avoid side effects because thanks to the targeted action which we call virtualization we enable the micro granule to address the targeted cells instead instead of randomly shooting the overall body we have selected the part of the plant that's been combined with others that go exactly where we want to go instead of if it's the full plant you just enforce everything to everybody in the body you don't want that because it's not because it's natural that it does not create side-effects we are very careful at that no side effects with us with our micro granule we are targeting the cells that we want to address reduce dosage one micro granule capsule is sufficient because of all what I've just said you need five powder capsules to equal 1 micro granule capsule doesn't this make a difference everyone wants this higher efficiency is your intake that's the message let me get now to what we call this intelligent release of the micro granules remember we have three different ways of delivering the active ingredients one is immediate release we have a set of products and as we speak more products are being invented by our team done in France but you have an example here of a few that apply the immediate release what does that mean 90% 96% of the active ingredients remember they have been protected so they are passing into the intestine our release progressively over an hour so it starts to be to them within the hour because you one directed ingredients to be released immediately based on what you're looking for here you are able to decide that it's going to be released immediately extended release that's very interesting you can work over eight hours thanks to the micro granule eight hours of efficiency think about when you want to go to sleep of course you can bombard and enforce a full plant of actives into the body fell asleep almost dead but you will wake up four hours later that's the biggest problem of people suffering for lack of sleep what we do thanks to the micro granule were able to add another four hours because we have this extended release delayed release that's also very interesting you can delay it light until two hours especially for products that use symbiotic which you want to release after two hours and release during the rest of the time quietly I'll comment a bit more on this product later on let's go to some of our top sellers first of all bear in mind that we have two big families of products one family is the well-being products well-being products are intended for prevention and in-depth actions these are products that you're going to recommend for a full month based on either 30 caps or 45 caps if you have to take one or two capsules so we have a whole range of products 20 of them but again more are being created at this time so you will see us again with innovation these products address a whole range of pathologies and they are actually very well priced based on the innovation that we're bringing to the market you have two sets of prices thirty four point ninety five dollars and thirty nine point ninety five dollars okay and it's about a month in take so again this range is for prevention and in depth action another range which makes a very big difference on the market we're the only ones today to have such a range of products in the nutritional supplements area these are called the chronal Activa chrono products kronole because they act ultra fast and when I say ultra fact after ultra fast I mean some of them act in less than 30 minutes what people are used to in the nutritional supplements area is to hear that well take this nutritional supplements and we will see each other again in about a month time see how it went this is fine but what happens when you're in crisis when you have an acute problem and you need to solve it right away like cystitis like diarrhea like a tension like a stress and well we will comment or acid reflux what happens you don't want to wait a month until something happens this is why we have created the chrono line so these are high level dosage products they are very low price 1695 1995 and they are backed up by the well-being range what you will see that if you get for instance let's take the circulation chrono circulation which is aimed at maintaining a blood circulation vascular maintenance etc you a woman has a problem of swollen legs this happens very often she needs immediate action she will take active a chronal circulation but at the same time she has chronic whole problems of circulation so the prescription will be when you have a crisis of soul and legs take this but please get an in-depth treatment with well-being circulation and take it throughout the month you will also see that the packaging of these products kronole is very nice very different it's a one-week intake it has all the explanation here of what the product is and it's magic for practitioners doctors because they can write the prescription here walk the patient through all the explanation of the different plans and their action and add its stamps for renewal other products at the back this is unique on the market not only in terms of efficiency but also of packaging and ease of use you slide it in your bag let's continue on the products so you've seen our two main lines so some top selling products again we have with the coronal line we have nine products we have twenty with well being you remember so we have about thirty products at this time some of the top sellers sleep remember the eight-hour efficiency the four plus four you bet that sleep is one of the best sellers because what happens when you wake up in the middle of the night yes you've taken this stuff for hours earlier but what you do next and it's too late when you've woken up you don't want to wake up take another pill on weight because your walk up with that you don't have to wake up at all eight hours of efficiency another top seller is our well-being blood pressure we are today the only ones on the market with the natural preventive and curative product 100% natural they said that enables to regulate blood pressure so also note that one capsule a day is enough and the action happens excuse me within the next two weeks this one is spectacular I encourage you to have your clothes bicycles wants to try them actually you have one sample of these products top sellers in your bags today another top seller is symbiotic because symbiotic is we could say the root of natural defenses of what makes us more create more immunity in our bodies and remember we say that the intestine is the second brain it's not the first one sometimes so we need to be very careful and maintain it properly symbiotic from Activa has is a two product in one it has both the prebiotics and the probiotics I don't know of any of any other manufacturer that does those two into one with as many different stem cells that's here including by the way invented which for some of you if you know that kids which were born through cesarean do not carry this stem cell so for them it is compulsory to take symbiotic twelve billion probiotics 100% gas were protected remember everything happens in the intestine we protect thanks to the micro granule technology 96 96 percent of the active ingredients where powder would only protect 15 to 20 percent in the chrono version because symbiotic also existing from a version for diarrhea to enter ital these crisis stuff 24 billion of probiotics so remember and try them again you have a sample elimination this product is also fantastic one in kernel version to cite it you can take as many antibiotics as you want women with societies for instance get accustomed get used to those antibiotics when it's Chronicle what we do when we open pharmacies in France because I tell you opening new accounts in France is difficult as anywhere but opening a pharmacy in the world is difficult opening a pharmacy in France if all of them possible so we are a laboratory that comes with innovation yes but we have that what they tell us so many other different nutritional supplements you know it's so fashionable these days we have more than we need with not only the chrono version but also the micro granule technology that makes a difference we open those accounts because no one has this and once they buy this they also buy the well-being because they need the in-depth action so the crust cell is natural and immediate so an easy one low price and for the crisis coming back to elimination for cystitis what doctors do is that they sell both the antibiotics but also try this because it's going to potentiate the effect the antibiotics it's low price and it's natural they buy it it has 100 milligram of oops sorry of the THC which means rito and t.v toronto CN n sorry it's a very technical word and I'm not so good at saying it in English which is a high concentration of the cranberry action that we're looking for and I tell you for all women who suffer from decided try this it's amazing chrono gastric which also exists of course into in the well-being version this one is for acid reflux again we are the only ones to have it on the market and I tell you even our map rizal which you may know of which is the chemical medicine that is very highly prescribed worldwide for people suffering for lack of acid balance in the stomach do you want to wait for a few weeks before you get better when you suffer from acid reflux you don't you cannot afford it same thing doctors now prescribe even when they prescribe a map result they prescribe this together with it low price and it acted immediately and then they just drop the only result and there is a clinical study in support of this clinical study that we didn't run that is an independent one that has highlighted the fact that comparing vinaigrette finis Greek which is the active ingredient in most majority that we're using this product to our map result the results were that fenugreek has more efficiency than all my pros all in preventing ulcer lesion formation so we're going really far into the symptoms acid reflux immediate action chrono gastric another one serenity what we've seen on the market dispatch few months unfortunately is that the level of anxiety at the human being level has increased dramatically at all levels even youngsters in because you know this anxious environment that had been created by well all sorts of attacks but also the media animating it etc so chrono serenity has an immediate action to within one hour again low price you can give it to kids when they have their to go through exams or whatever anyone anxious it doesn't get you drowsy it just makes you serene you have a sample of it if any of you is a little bit anxious today I hope not during this training but after the training or tomorrow try it and combine with sleep you know if you don't want it be anxious during the dinner time but you don't want to get drowsy easy either take this first and then 30 minutes before going to bed take sleep you will see the difference alrighty so let's get to our summary now innovation micro granule remember enables a lot of things higher efficiency and chronobiology remember the control release immediate delayed extended and limited product development opportunities as I speak as I was saying products are being developed in our lab encouraging trends because you can mix as many different active ingredients as you want thanks to the micro granule we can have 5 6 10 products into one with one intake versus 5 remember the dosage versus powder Packaging sells seller they all wanted support for prescription hey doctors love that easy prescription because broad range of applications mean large number of patients if you can address all types of symptoms remember efficacy thanks to the gutter protection that enables high concentration of active dry extracts five times more efficient than powder control Rudy's we've seen this and the krona line one way when we cover within hours if it even if it's not in 30 minutes for some of the products these of use producing takes you take one capsule instead of five other and taste masking easy to swallow remember that for kids you can open up the capsule and put the micro granules into a little bit of yogurt or milk or so safety of course because you can we have those control the stability of the product and pharmacy grade quality manufacturing remember we have twenty years of history behind us and the pharmacy feedback I now want to thank you for your attention and we're going to open for Q&A so we'll be happy to receive questions from you and we have here in the room our CEO or mark very who's going to be happy to join me for answering questions and a natural doctor or natural practitioner Lawrence Hoppus is going to also join us so he can also our witness the testimonial of his use of active our products in is the daily consultancy thank you very much very attention [Applause] good so our natural practitioner who's been using our products so Lauren Papas almost 20 years and our CEO and founder America very so ready to take questions so I think there was one down here yes see a lot of time that we see their patients have compromised digestion do you see that that may impact that kind of biology and the attempt to either have something really immediately or delayed response do you see an impact at all from somebody already had compromised digestion with me most people together we can get up my possession and clinically what happen is immune system is then attacking the substance that you're putting out and if identified limited should be a friend as an end and there could be autoimmune considerations then which can exacerbate a problem and trying to give we'll help them and for that reason what you put down there is especially important and so what's happened here is because of the way and we use the word symbiosis but the ways it compounded these formulas how the kind of smoothness that is unparalleled in my experience in the planet it's not just balance it is not just clean everything that we needed for everything also it doesn't do any harm but these are the kind of things that when people take them it there's no burping there's a pace there's no resistance in the body to accepting them for some reason that they could go into more detail if they created a matrix that provides information and structure together so these things are well received and the nonchalance at the lumen is my experience great question so you I'm assuming you have like some clinical trials that we can see for we mentioned the blood pressure Phil I'd love to see the trials that you've completed with the one pill a day the market that it lowered and stuff like that I'd also like to see you mentioned a power versus the micro granules so 15% to 96% I'd also like to see kind of the studies you did on that to show the doctors and do you have a product that lowers cardiovascular markers outside of just the blood pressure do you have one of those because I'd like to see that product and also the clinical trials of that product that's something that I can sell again just to answer one part of you of your question that Michael gallis confront and deserve from Africa and in fact is use for the top three stage Michael in the power strength behind Muffy to protect and also the only four adorable from forget ticketed process what you forgetting is when and when approved by a pharmaceutical technology trip so all the people to do you have a younger delivery stands for sensation we redrawing the possesses a very well-documented I hate it we need this general study see I'm just a cook than the question that we're gonna get one from the practitioners you know every time I'm selling a new product to noodle this market practitioners always want to know that in that experience next we've brought new brands from overseas before organization and they always want to know that stuff so so we'll take it action item to provide them okay wonderful and then as far as a second question I think the circulation product is probably acting on the party maybe that term broad actions but they didn't actually explain that very well and so what's happening is is that whole body systems are being dressed like this now when you're taking a client comes in to see you is a that's about what you really want to be as alleviate your symptoms quickly if you know they're not going to come back and so every natural practitioner has a sort of abyss for that vocabulary and Arsenal's they've developed overtime like wow this will help the person but not just in symptoms depression we want to get a pattern on pause and I think this split there between the chrono where they're giving something is rapid acting is a disaster Senta why it's coming back this doesn't actually create the whole solution are solely media so it's going to give you is acutely addressed while the underlying premise it is something you're going to want separately but with this situation tonic they're addressing absolute fear microvasculature and arterial structures as well as heart valves in the heart muscle itself through the lollipop they're going to take the blood pressure reduction and then clinically is up to you as a clinician to know oh I need to handle the stress piece for this person by adding the serenity for me to be able to kiddie component with the elimination piece so the majority of products that we distribute here are temperature sensitive and looking at the symbiotic it appears to be shelf-stable said the big questions an important question so anytime you have a protocol needle is it we have something living its metabolizing and one of the town rises it produces waste product and the waste products that produces are poisonous to the life-form so it's very common in the industry you want to sell something with a guarantee of a hundred million two hundred million or five hundred million because you know the time it's going to be great as you cool things down is slow metabolism and so a lot of times people have resorted to refrigeration but these things are a lot and they are selecting themselves based on the environment that they're in so if I mean cultured in refrigeration they are preferential to colder temperatures and then they look less well in the warm body in other words they get in you and revised rate low they're like whoa they're being knocked out of 96 degrees so by working with probiotics that are naturally more adapted and suited for one iron plus the actual electric manual because they did to explain very much about the detail of that in calculation but they're controlling the environment within there so there's no there and though moisture getting in is so what's happiness because that secatur it is not metabolically active and you see these things like a pond that's been dried for twenty years add water and all this microbial life can be driver twenty years because they D build structures for desiccation into themselves and so because these are perfectly hermetically sealed the action allows them to revive themselves even after a very long period of time it's ready I want to have to that a lot of time visited a bacterium do not love surviving enteric channeling so given strategies well if we put 21 billion down or something need a few stragglers we'll run it down there but that's not harming you know there's a war going on down there so the idea that you can deliver 96 percent we can see the large intestine means that your whole armies arriving fraction impact and it's difficult to orally colonize the large intestine clinically but this is a solution yes for PDF if you have a child who's on the opposite spectrum and they're anxious at a high level and anxiety and also high level of activity do you with having Julie was on the Ottoman with this clinical experience with autism and they're not interactive and a lot of times there's a lot of emotional things under plane and they don't respond about with something new so if we try to introduce in these foods or take away their favorite food and every practitioner that works on the autism feel has their own set of tricks and techniques which are cool what we found is is they've been like we'll just put them on a movie so they're not so they're too dot they're not paying attention and then they want their favorite food whether it's a soy milk like a chocolate soy milk or an applesauce or something that they'll actually eat it yogurt too and then we open up the capsule make is a serenity which really supports the lowering of anxiety their minds noticing it when they're when you're in taking it and suddenly with calmer and more interactive at that point you can start to work with some of the deeper things that you need you to detoxification cellular intelligence communities think that's happening with young people these days if nerve attack right there attack their psyches render attack so much stress in their parents and of connected with assessing the parents so we actually tell them to the parents to take the product to and so the actual parents body is informing the child's body while we're giving Oh mom call be speaking of this Trinity help to reduce anxiety also reduce the cortisol is a single word beautiful or specifically that is this one so the body's built on something that there's really not enough here is on the tension there's on a projection is on the form not up immunity and because of that the body has to lose prioritize like budget I want to spend my energy this way and so when you're budgeting trailers Reserve understand my man like one time I turned a corner these are folks probably 21 or something and an airship caught she's hired at the same time open up Kurt cantata and at that point if you to ask me if I could you know buy two new tires I would have said there's no way but it was amazing with Ben's like a day I have two desires on my part because I found a way so when your body's in this the stress cortisol channel and keep the internalization frankly if I would like to resist wanting to lower that to become ecstatic it's just that it was nervous but it didn't like getting it but doesn't want to talk and so using something like the serenity you're not just suppressing the body cortisone response but you're actually looking to give about this without that it wants and so it opens the door with is yet how we let that acting hand and that's why I create palm and then your body can't digest and do-hyun and regulates blood sugar off they're two questions on so typically a lot of products that we sell for sweet primarily they'll have milk only associate with it obvious form own and other things but we decide to go instead and put the melatonin in the Serenity instead of asleep which a reason or methodology for yawn is that's the back door so the Serenity offers so can also does an enormous number of things in fact one of the things that surprised me recently that I the radio protective so people that were taking Ella's on and respond better to radiation assaults and ones that weren't and part of that sister that Gavin area great chemistry to get out of my meal plan when it doesn't have to manufacture melatonin it can do a growth hormone a lot of other interesting things so what we find this melatonin is is that the body build resistance to it eventually doesn't actually work at a sleep aid but itself and so in our sleep product they've done some special things so that the body won't resist it doesn't knock you out like a pharmaceutical would but it's so subtle that it sweet sneaks up on you and then you simply are just asleep without actually realizing and then you get real and true sleep in that absolutely product by the way I understand it you can correct me but also once the body has surrendered and accepted that the thing the academics that it wants out of sanity it's also letting it million it's creating a comment that feels alert and awake it's not grounds for the kind of song it seems a little common to ative because we always think of melatonin that you're going to go to sleep so don't take anything that contains that right and then my second question was a vegetable capsule so its source corn source my understanding is is not and what was they looking for with the very specific pH neutral encapsulation that matched to that page of the Java and weird lady they went to a fish source I believe that right and then slowly evolved this into sort of non formal non-gmo it's great yeah English is for that on your sleep and most sleeping pills you wake up with like a hangover describe how how does this does this have any at all right so what happens with the body is because it's on your Saturday it means that the way that it is it wants to stay that way so if it's not sleeping on some level that's working for it intelligence is selecting the fact that it wants to do something else besides sleep and I remember the college named one time I had to stay for my final and I found myself in cleaning the bathroom I'm scared out of clothes thinking what am i doing and I was just in the voice I was avoiding studying for my finals and I would get in the back type of thing and then we know pharmaceutically we've been humor the body down but then it goes into resistance to that it's going to then try to grow or sleep inducing chemistry and same way with caffeine it only works to a point then you need some more and some more coming up what's happy with the synergy that they're doing here in the sort of in general symbiotic nature but they're saying they found doorways to let nature in with the body doesn't exist the bodies is actually starting to Auto regulators quickly into new ways of e without a lot of existence so you know it's with water the transient kind of slow and there's no resistance they hit it at 100 miles an hour we play stuff real bad and so what based on it\u00eds even though it's coming in rapidly the format that it's in informational e and in your structure because coming in the way that the body is not pulling up a barrier - and now for the first two or three days or four days is the potential for somebody's really just does not want to sleep with their bodies down say I don't want to regulate - that and you know if you've taken too much sleep after a nap vanilla day or something you can kind of feels own I would think you might have that feeling with a small percentage of people who are really very hot balance but the point if this quickly brings them back into balance where they're feeling energized and alert and for most people surprisingly high percent of people will not even notice that they took the pill fill just go to sleep and go don't go to go sleep last night - oh wait a minute I woke up okay this point it's that kind of thing where you don't even notice okay thank you thank you", "kpKDjRPHwjc": "happy Valentine's Day let me ask you this when I sit down for say what comes to your mind okay except chocolate because I do a roasted shortly okay chocolate okay how about today we're getting to make chocolate a chef crystal here right here he's going to teach me how to make chocolate so how do we start okay so the first thing to do is do we need some chocolates and we need to check on the chocolate and so the first thing we're gonna do we're gonna have melted chocolate you can do it in a microwave or double boiler okay and then what we're gonna do we're gonna have some our peaceful with it it's gonna basically temper the chocolate so what we're doing we're gonna cool down their own kind of mass and bring those good crystal is called tempering by the sitting method okay so right now what we're just doing is nothing all the chocolates yeah so right now we want to bring the temperatures to 90 degree for an eye so let me ask you just push stop doesn't work is what I usually do I'm immature but then up what I do is I broke up two chocolate bars in a bowl like this right and then I will put it into a microwave with 60 seconds I take it out I slowly stir and then it's not completely melt so I put it in again but 30 seconds click it out again and and stir it into everything melt it away yes it works as well as long you maintain you don't want to burn your chocolate chocolate so this is Valentine's Day we're going to make this down heart shape lollipops chocolate lollipops you need at home you're going to need a mole something like this with this kind of stick some toppings so keep that at villa chocolate you have all kinds of toppings you have all the chocolates to choose from and I really also recommend you to come here if you're in New York City come here and make your own chocolate but if you can't wait can we buy these puppies there is a special stores which specialize in candy little short man ok ok yes me OK for food carry some of them to flip it upside down I'm going to remove the plate you can do it there now you're going to place the transfer sheet pause so the transverse chain has one side that we have the print and a foot device yes this is correct beautiful is my favorite color by the way is gorgeous ok now we're putting it on and you put it back over putting it back and then now you're gonna start to put your lollipop stick on it and then after that you have to choice you can start to put some topping if you want beautiful on DJ okay then when you raise our making such a poor are the chocolates so when you do this at home again you can't I feel like you can just put it in a ziplock back way you could do that okay and then you cut the top and then put your chocolate inside and then you can start pour your chocolate invisible okay just just press and then the chocolates gonna start bill the bag is not open enough we will open again this is so much better at the ledge chocalate okay so in order to get your chocolate even shake your trick so usually we advise that you start to decorate a star to it then your top and still stick on the lollipop you can put a little bit beautiful so they say I think this is one of the culture this is the best way to be on creating now look at their a happy face have usually okay well he's the front of work with it hey there you go that's a happy faces we can put two I felt like I'm not the best artist I really not look at this is a lot how long are we putting it in a freezer so we're gonna actually pull them down for at least ten minutes okay ten minutes they will be ready to mold later so much chocolate your chocolate is ready ready to your mold now you're gonna take the transfer sheet out look at that little individual packaging those tiny little ball rabbits they get bit more if you like the videos if I see people beat down in the box below subscribe to our channel happy face ranges and dramas sure and like my video also you can find me on Facebook Twitter Instagram all that and if you actually have to come to more chocolates a lot of people don't consider chocolate to be healthy food but it can be if you eat good chocolate got a high percentage of cacao and you eat one to two ounces a day it's actually very good for you sounds good", "9RQHG7ag56o": "okay i think it looks like

presentations um dr joe garberly from karen treatment center talked about the um the addictive nature of this substance and what some of the fallout has been with the clients or the patients that he's been seeing at karen which is one of the top five rehabs in the country it happens to be right here in um the reading area warnersville pa um his recording of his presentation is on that page as well as another presentation by david fialco who explains what vaping is looking like these days nicotine oils and thc products so that is there and also our youth marijuana prevention project is linked on that page as well because we have a lot of information there also um we have a program coming up that is sponsored by that youth marijuana prevention project funded by montgomery county drug and alcohol program um and uh this is called cannabis that's complicated this will be especially great for parents to attend if you have um a son or daughter who is experimenting or is is deeply into their cannabis use this will be really helpful to you we have a local clinician who's phenomenal he's been a speaker of ours a few times his name is patrick dowling he's a licensed professional counselor and we will also have a young man who is uh in recovery from from cannabis use disorder um and he's going to talk about his experience with high potency thc and his subsequent recovery from that that's on october 27th and you can actually ask judy if you can share the online page the conversation dot zone slash online in the chat box that will take people to learn more about this and register to attend along with other programs we have coming up at the end of this program you'll have an opportunity to take a survey we really appreciate it if you can do that it helps us to know what was working for you what you might have learned wanted to hear more about or what you'd like to hear about in the future from us um so please even if you've been with us before we really appreciate you taking this survey and it'll as i said it'll pop up on your screen as soon as the program ends so uh without further ado i'm gonna get to um uh we're gonna actually introduce jeff hanley first i think it would be nice for us to hear a little bit about where things are in the state of pennsylvania right now so uh i'll stop sharing my screen and uh turn it over to you jeff all right well thank you kim and judy for having me i certainly appreciate it good morning everyone i'm great to see ben again i i started as the executive director of cpa in january of last year and uh lived in mercer county pa for years but also my wife and i spent some time in colorado for a few years and lived there and i heard ben speak in colorado at a school district a few years ago talking about marijuana and the impacts to date in colorado and it was such a great presentation um and it's so nice to to see ben uh here in pennsylvania um providing all of us which with such great information resources so we appreciate it and appreciate um kim and judy everything that you guys are doing too this is fantastic um so i just thought i could just provide really briefly uh just a quick update on some of the current legislation in the state i'll share my screen here real quick and um so everybody can see uh the three bills that are currently in the pennsylvania general assembly um there's senate bill 350 2050 in 1899 um i know that kim is going to share um this and then have this available to everybody um but i think the one thing that i would really encourage is to everybody go to uh these these websites and just take a real quick look at um mostly the bills but also uh what committee they were referred to so you can see here um i linked all these so anybody can go here and just click on the blue shaded areas and and um and pull up those committees so these three bills are in currently in committee which could be good news could be bad news uh the worst thing for a bill in pennsylvania is if committee never acts on it and then it just dies um so i would recommend um checking this out um all three of these committees are a majority owned or majority republican party um so um that is good news in regards to this issue uh what we're hearing um that there are are general assemblies back in session today um so i think or excuse me on monday they go back in session on monday the one thing that i definitely wanted to share at the bottom here so so you can see the session days remaining there are not many session days remaining and in 2020 uh the general assembly must adjourn by midnight of november 30th in even numbered years due to the expiration of terms so uh keep that in mind we know that they can add days to they can have session days to do voting they i can't imagine them accomplishing what they need to accomplish in four days uh through november so i would imagine that we would see a little bit of a change but uh keep that in mind starting monday we're going to hear a lot more about recreational marijuana we are going to hear more about expansion or deregulation of alcohol policy so uh anything that i hear i'll definitely pass on to kim and to everybody else to share but uh i would again just recommend pulling up any of these um committees and um the websites are real well done you can just see who's in charge of each of these committees and and if they're in your area if you know them make a call i i here's the majority the uh the republicans and then the minority of the democrats if you know any of these legislators i would really recommend making a call to their office and and just um talking about the legalization of recreational marijuana and what that would look like for you and your community um so um again those three bills i just wanted to finally say those three bills are are in committee still so they are all an option uh to to be looked at and voted on uh there is a resource from representative wheatley's website that i think kim might share um after the session and it shows the differences of the three bills it does a nice job of doing that um but um there is a lot of other information on that sheet that really isn't factual but you can at least see talking points from the representative standpoint on how they are trying to push this through and all the fact i think he has a a myth or fact page um all of those are very very uh disputable and there are many talking points available for us to sit there and say well ways again marijuana is addictive and here's what that looks like so um i i think only other thing real quick kim is just medical marijuana there's really a lot of discussion on these bills uh if if legalizing recreational marijuana uh were to get out of the committee a bill how would that affect medical marijuana and there's a lot of dispute between republicans and democrats uh republicans want to um they want to make sure that um that they are looking to protect um the medical marijuana current industry and what that looks like so uh it'll be interesting to see how that all kind of plays out and i know ben has talked before about what medical marijuana looks like um in some other states um especially after legalization of recreational has occurred so um a lot will happen next week and and again we'll keep our eyes and ears tuned to it as much as possible and update the field but now is a perfect time now it's a perfect time to look at those committees and and see if there's folks that you know and that you feel really comfortable reaching out to and just sharing your thoughts on on this and what this could look like for you for your community and um just come prepared with a couple talking points and and and you'll be in great shape so we certainly appreciate your advocacy your support and if there's anything that um i can do just please reach out at any time thank you kim thanks so much jeff and we already have one question if there are any bills related to decriminalizing and i think you'll find it i'm just in the process of posting those materials that jeff referenced onto that page but you'll find that that they do some do address it and some do not so i don't know if there's much more we can say about that at this point but okay yeah there's no nothing separate for decriminalization at all um i don't know if i see that happening um but uh you know we're just hearing right now things it doesn't seem like this is set to come out of committee um but it's such strange times strange times with covet that everybody's looking for new revenue and when they start saying new revenue um who knows uh what could possibly happen and we're working with um tobacco control and some looking at what taxes on tobacco could look like what taxes on alcohol could look like to help generate some new revenue so as we look at those numbers and hopefully get them really soon we'll share um so might be an opportunity for new revenue without uh legalizing um substance thank you kim great thank you so much jeff okay and now i will turn it over to the one and only ben court ben are you all set to go are you going to unmute i think so i was just reading lauren's question yeah i need some help on that uh from you guys but i can answer a bit of it i think we'll get to some of these other questions toward the end we'll we'll address these thank you for submitting those please keep keep them coming we'll we'll do our best to get to them i'm really easily distracted so when you send them in um probably if you just sort of see me staring it's not just because it's quarter or seven in the morning here in colorado um it's it's because i'm looking at the questions that came in and i really appreciated um the ones that everybody sent before i'll um answer a few of those throughout and then also go through them um bullet point at the end so my intent right now is to end um at 9 30 your time so we can have a solid 30 minutes for questions and between the four of us do our best to answer or at least find you some resources pardon me to uh to answer those um i'm bummed i'm not out there with you guys right now i was telling jeff you know like when it's not raining and in the fall i think happy valley is going to be one of the prettiest places in the whole country my wife's from central pennsylvania and my little sister's in bucks county and that's why these were so easy to agree to do because i could go stay with my sister and screw around with my nephew but now this damn internet business i don't get to do anything fun um i i'm i'm gonna really try my best not to just do a repeat of um conversations that we've already had however i've gotta lay a little bit of a foundation in the two planning sessions that judy and kim and i have had and trying to figure out what's relevant to this group and what might be purely repetitive i'm going to really try and focus on a couple of specific things which testing and driving because i think as you guys are considering these things legislatively that's incredibly important as well as what we know about mental health and co-occurring issues associated with thc um i i'm also as any of you know who've read anything i've written or seen anything i've done specifically most interested in um the effects that uh the industrialization has on consumption patterns as well as the actual products people are consuming so we're going to discuss those briefly as well um jeff in that paper you had i i honed in right away on the underlying part you had where it said that we there all three bills are encouraging um small business to keep the big players out and so i'm gonna talk to that for a minute too because pennsylvania is not the first to try that um okay so let's see if i can share the screen again for any of you who have been a party uh to stuff that i've done in the past um bear with me on this little bit of a review but we've gotta we gotta have some foundational knowledge but i guarantee it won't be nearly as much as usual all right let's see if i can get this little block thing out of here okay cool um kim can you see my screen okay everything look good looks great sounds great imagine that [Laughter] all right 21st century this is different we were talking about something very very different than what you smoked in the 70s and i i think that one of the most important part parts to doing a responsible job of considering this is that you've got to first recognize that we are not talking about the plant that so many people think that we are talking about um though those days are um they're they've passed into myth and history uh because this is a new school of cannabis and for us especially those of you who are lawmakers those of you who are charged with representing uh us and taking care of us from a policy standpoint you have to understand what it is people are consuming today for um us to do a good job of actually regulating it so the the idea that we have that we know so much about cannabis almost always comes from our own personal experience if not our own personal experience it's second hand experience and i would challenge that other than alcohol cannabis is probably the only substance in this country that everybody either has first or second hand experience with and the vast majority of people do not have first hand experience with it despite what they say most people have never consumed um but everybody knows a guy all you all went to school with somebody um you've got an uncle you've got a sister you've got everybody knows someone who at some point has consumed and the issue that that um that brings up is that we we think that we understand this because we know folks uh who have been exposed to it in the past but here's the reality of it that unless um you have consumed or know very well someone who has consumed commercial products that were produced within the last couple of years um you really your your construct of what this is is incredibly antiquated and that's dangerous if you've got an industry that knows exactly what it is they're selling and what it is they're doing and we don't understand exactly what it is we're regulating and what it is that we are trying to um be responsible with so here's all you gotta do to understand um the situation these next two slides unfortunately these data um have not been continued past 2010 um the 2011 was reporting that we got into 2010 anyway sorry we're not going to see a continuation of these data but this was amazing because it was done at a national level and beginning in 1960 and ending um last measured year 2010 reported 2011 this is the percentage of thc inside of cannabis over 50 years a representative sample from law enforcement seizures from every state and what a couple of things for you to understand that thc is the psychoactive component inside of cannabis if you don't have thc you've got hemp you've got a really interesting textile that incidentally makes the shoes that i'm wearing at the moment and has nothing whatsoever to do with getting high uh you you you've got a plant that's used to build and do things with with the thc you get um the the high so the more thc a little oversimplified here but the more thc you've got in it um the higher somebody's going to be able to get okay so when we talk about cannabis traditionally and something that i think is exceptionally important for you to understand especially as you're having conversations with people who like to cite the history of it is that when we began measuring this at um university in mississippi in 1960 we see what really naturally occurs inside the cannabis and what goes uh you know we've seen this uh there's actually been mummified cannabis plants that we found that we can test inside of tombs in asia and africa and we know that what naturally occurs inside of cannabis is somewhere between a point two and a point five percent thc that is the substance that humankind has interacted with for millennium of course there were some exceptions with higher percentages particularly around some religious traditions but you certainly weren't seeing anything more than maybe two or three percent thc globally anywhere in the world um until the 1970s so what ended up happening and since this is america it's fun knowing the history and learning a little we can actually kind of tell you what led to this spike um and then the rest of this is just good um uh gardening this is just folks who know how to um cultivate stronger and stronger and stronger because in this country we like to get high so here's the this is the most important thing i think i'm going to show you uh today is this next slide so um set the coffee down lean in get ready to take a picture of this one because th this is to me sort of what it's all about so i'm showing you 50 years in increments of 2.5 percent so over the past 50 years this is how much it's grown i am adding colorado to that in the blue and unfortunately these data will never be continued either um the whistleblower who came out with all of them anyway long story what you see here is the transformation of a plant into a commercialized drug and as we talk and discuss the importance of understanding and regulating we must move away from the hyperbole that describes this simply as a plant because it is no longer a plant this is a manufactured substance this isn't grown outside by farmers this is produced indoors by chemists with the intent of getting as much thc into a product as you can to sell for as cheaply as you possibly can because the math is really really simple um colorado has relatively good data we don't have anything after um sales gear 2018 but in sales year 2018 of all of the weed thc that we sold in colorado which was a lot um almost 80 of all of the thc was purchased by 20 of the consumers meaning that those who consume on average eight times daily are the ones who are driving eighty percent of this market they want stronger they don't just want stronger they need stronger because the way the tolerance works with this very very different than alcohol and opiates tolerance to thc is a different thing so what you see and what happens is that that fringe uh the smaller group of people who are absolutely buying and consuming the most are the ones who drive it and that's why you get pushing potencies like this because it's just driven by a market need so again i would challenge um the the idea that this is the same thing that humankind has consumed and interacted with for millennium it absolutely is not it has gone from a plant to a drug when we moved away from good gardening to good chemistry uh and the chemistry is even better now and and i thought it was nice that uh there there's an intent to try and keep it small and keep the big industries out but that will not happen uh you might figure out keeping them out for a little bit but the the reality is that the chemists from here the chemist from california the the folks with the phds who are actually manipulating this plant to get that amount of thc into it they're going to be in pennsylvania in a minute the same way they went to canada the same way they went to washington and oregon and there's um there is a multi-billion dollar a lot of different ways to count how much it is but probably around a 20 billion dollar industry behind this movement it's not so much a movement as it is a marketing campaign at this point and you had better believe that they are not going to let a state the size of pennsylvania allow the mom and pops to make the money from that mom and pops might make it for a couple of months but uh give it a minute med men will be in town like they are everywhere next most important thing that i decided you had to understand um is that the dsm which is the manual that uh mental health professionals and psychiatrists use to diagnose um it's where you get the icd code so that we can you know bill insurance and all of this kind of business um the last version of it the five which came out i think it's been three years now somebody will correct me on that if i'm not wrong um if i'm wrong included objective diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal and um the reason why this is so so significant is that the idea of physical withdrawal from thc um up until the last couple of years was like like a funny joke like they would be like oh i must be withdrawing because i stopped laughing at spongebob like i must be withdrawing because i haven't bought um cheetos in the last two weeks like it cannabis withdrawal from a physical standpoint wasn't really a thing but in the last couple of years it has become a thing um so my actual job now um and the reason why i'm up in the mountains i took over a small men's only treatment program up here called the foundry um and i said at the ceo desk for it and while our numbers aren't big we work with 25 or 30 guys at a time um we're on the absolute front lines of this and we see it just like everybody in my field is saying if you ask man ask your colleagues and friends in pennsylvania what they're saying with it the the physical withdrawn the need to treat that physical withdrawal from thc is um is one of the best problems that we're saying over the last couple of years and there's not um there are no pharmacologic interventions for it it's not like we've got [Music] drugs to help people come off of this it's also something that's so little is known about that it's not often being treated adequately um and i'll tell you that it's a very very real thing and it's a big deal and it's also important for those of you who work in my field i believe that there are some of you on here fellow um mental health uh professionals and prevention folks to understand that as somebody is going through this for the i mean really out to about 16 days with a resurgence it seems like um 10 to 14 days or so they can be getting their asses kicked physically they can be really going through some hard stuff and struggling and so for up for us i think it's part of our responsibility to um learn more about this and understand the ways that we can treat it but but the simple fact that today we are categorizing thc uh with objective criteria for physical withdrawal should show you how very much um this drug has changed because it wasn't so um the most important factors when we are discussing dependence and now we're going to we're going to shift into diagnosable substance use disorder or cannabis use disorder are these age of onset frequency of use and thc potency and what we have found is is that so when we consider thc an addiction um it is very real absolutely objectively quantifiable and it's not easy to treat um i'm not going to go into the details of how this is quantified because i've done that in a lot a lot of different places but when you hear the marijuana is not addictive sort of a thing um that's that's uh old school that's somebody who hasn't stayed up on anything or it's somebody who's trying to manipulate the facts of it because objectively speaking without bias and without the politics of it all um thc absolutely is addictive and i mean to the point where where we get physical dependence on it uh the reason one of the reasons why it's not easy to treat is because you have people saying stuff like that it's not addictive nobody's ever died from it and i'll tell you though again those of you who work inside of my field um consider the microaggressions that exist in there when we get somebody into treatment we say something like oh it's just weed well you don't need a detox it's it's only that it's it's very difficult for us to treat i think because we bring so much bias into it and if you can imagine the social fallout that there is for somebody who raises their hand and said i need treatment for my thc addiction if somebody says i gotta i gotta kick heroin it's time for me to get off meth i need to stop drinking everybody rallies around them and supports them since a lot of the times our communities are made up of other people who consume thc when we say guys i think i need to stop thc the number of hurdles that they have had to cross and jump over to get there a lot of the times is pretty profound like it takes a lot of effort to stick with it as everybody's gonna push back on it with these totally antiquated ideas that it's um uh it's not addictive i think these probably have to be the same folks who are saying um it's not warming up and uh cobit's just gonna go away and everything's awesome there are people who just aren't really paying super close attention to what's actually happening it often requires much longer stays in treatment as well as antipsychotic medications to balance the psychosis that happens that we'll discuss a little bit in the beginning and the trick with it requiring longer stays is that as insurers i'm sure they know exactly what's happening but you know and insurers don't really like paying for things what you see is big big pushback from insurance companies on actually staying in treatment for as long as it takes um we had a case recently where it was um six weeks uh before the young man's psychotic symptoms actually died down to a point where we could start to to treat and of course at that point insurance had long since stopped paying and um we were just floating them um he was staying here and a big part of it was because i was really curious personally about how long it would take for him to kind of come back to earth and it was a pretty beautiful thing to see when it happened but um it takes a longer time to treat him so traditional addiction rates to thc were around 10 uh and this this is what we used up until about 2012 and in 2012 um there were some uh studies that would suggest that it was depending on those um those uh um factors i showed you before onset frequency and potency that would be up to about fifteen percent and in a huge meta study just published this month um we see that those are actually reaching as high as 30 percent as a result of the increased potency so a rate of 30 percent uh an addiction rate of 30 percent to a substance is pretty significant so that means that um a person will meet the objective diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder about a third of everybody who is exposed um can get to that point again this is this is why you've gotta stop thinking about it is the cheech and chong plant and the giant you know two foot long doobie that somebody's rolling up and the smoke all day and get a little hungry sort of a thing um were it still that substance you absolutely would not see this so a lot of these uh patients with a substance use disorder in cannabis require physical detox as well as medical intervention and the medical intervention um at this point at least uh revolves mostly around antipsychotic medications um because there's a difference so a lot of folks who come in to get treated for thc are experiencing psychosis um and what you've got to do which we'll talk about in a minute and what you've got to do is determine um and figure out if you're looking at a psychotic episode or a psychotic break a psychotic episode um you come back from a psychotic break some kind of shifts up here so a lot of the times we find ourselves administering short-term antipsychotic drugs in order to get to a point where we can can actually treat the patient and again i i i fully recognize that when you talk about this stuff and if we had longer i would have done a much better job of dancing and and uh easing into it so you wouldn't think i was some crazy reefer madness kind of dude but we just don't have time for it the the reality is that guys i'm a recovering drug addict raising from thc was a big part of it 24 years so we're raising three kids in public school in the weed capital of the country who runs an addiction treatment program here i got a pretty damn good viewpoint and i recognize that some of this might be hard for people to hear that no no you can't require physical detox no no they're not actually taking antipsychotics yes you are and and yes that's exactly what we are doing and um i i hope that a lot of us can shed our own bias and our own desires for this to be a quick fix and a panacea and something that'll make everything work to recognize that what's actually happening here is different than what we thought so here's what um a commercialized market looks like and again i don't have time to go into the economics of it just brief so you understand the vast majority of thc is purchased by the most dedicated consumers the people who use multiple times daily and because of the way the thc um binds and in the way that your tolerance grows to it you you just gotta keep getting it stronger to get the same effect so remember the couple of slides ago where i told you that what naturally occurs and up until um a couple of decades ago was 0.2 to 0.5 percent thc um we're seeing products right now that are pretty much pure thc 99.99 thc which is um remarkable for a lot of reasons but the the one of the ones i'd like to point out to you is that no recreational state no matter how hard they've tried has ever limited potency we attempted in colorado two years later when a lot of people here felt buyers remorse a big group of folks got together and they tried to uh impose a limit of 16 thc in colorado and the reason why they used 16 was um it's the best information that we have um about the the effects of high potency thc is capped out at about 16 percent um we really have no idea what um 20 thc is doing to the human brain and body from a scientific standpoint i can tell you um anecdotally and what we see but we we tried to stop it at 16 percent here in colorado and um you saw an industry unite uh like nothing i'd ever seen before and they said we'll kill the market it'll kill the concentrate market um you can't do that you don't understand what you're doing the problem is they uh this this industry banks on the fact that we don't understand what they are doing and what they are doing like any other industry that has addictive potential anyone food opiates alcohol porn it doesn't matter every single one of those industries has to drive user engagement and the way that the cannabis industry drives user engagement is by getting more people dependent on it and the higher the thc potency the more dependent the other things that matter the most um certainly when a person begins consuming it and they're going to say the same stuff that the tobacco industry said because they're saying here in colorado oh we'd never want a kid to get high oh good god we'd never want a kid to get high and i i've got literally over 600 photographs just of the most egregious clear dedicated marketing to children using cartoon characters you know using stuff that would make joe camel um turn over in in his grave spuds mckenzie look like nothing because we don't recognize that this is what they're trying to do trying to drive use so that they can make more money one of the things i love about um kim and judy and and the entire organization here is the fan is the focus that we have on children and the importance that you guys see in the developing young brain and i think it's beautiful and i think um if you guys do get an established cannabis industry inside of pennsylvania you might have some friends there because they absolutely also have a focus on youth and on the developing young brain because that is how they drive profits that and creating stuff like this 99.9 thc so what we all have these ideas about the you know mom and pop kind of farm um farm-to-table cannabis and everything this is what's really going on behind the scenes drive potency drive use drive early engagement and so here we are thinking well we're going to regulate this thing and we're going to teach people how to do it we're going to wait because because when i was a kid this was how we drove around and meanwhile the industry is like awesome pops you go ahead and figure out building a regulatory infrastructure for your freaking model t well we're ripping around in this thing and let's see who comes out with the money at the end of it all because weed isn't weed anymore it's not this this bud that you see here it's um wax and it's uh butter and it's chatter um the and again we we don't have uh i don't have the time to to get into all of this but what you've got to understand is that the lion's share of the market the most money in colorado is being spent on concentrates these are concentrates this is what the cannabis market in colorado looks like it's not 60 year olds buying buds it's 21 year olds buying this and sharing it with other young people it this is a concentrate so concentrated cannabis and you'll see your um proposed bills all have language that includes this in it this is what the commercial thc market looks like it's not plants and buds and pretty things it's this because this is how you get higher thc potency into a product so that folks can um overcome the the tolerance that they've built up and and here's um really the future of commercialized thc markets a thing called a distillate um this is the this is what um our market is sort of centered around in colorado when you go to the dispensaries it's on counters i go to lots of dispensaries um this so that's that's what's being sold as weed and i'd like everybody just to take a second and look at that and shake your head and say that's not weed no it's not it's a concentrated thc that started looking like this uh this was before it was cooled that's great distillate water clear no alchemy just pure science can you imagine the scientific acumen it must take to go from a green organic material to this and then we package it up and we sell it like that it's not weed but it's absolutely being sold as and this is the majority of our the market in colorado there you think you'd ever see the day um that's a commercialized cannabis market this this is all thc and then vaping you guys have better things about this uh i'm not going to cover it edibles are a huge problem the issue with them is that you have multiple servings and you guys will too multiple servings inside of um one package and because of the uh okay so there's no fda oversight nobody is overseeing this at the federal level so that means every state has to manage um all of these um food products and topical products and things which is definitely something that states are not used to doing because it's fda's job but since this is federally illegal fda can't have anything to do with it so what is ended up happening is the um the edible market is exploded uh and to include things like this if you so edibles we traditionally thought of as like baking an organic material into a brownie or something like that here here's an edible um that's infused with a distillate so if you remember the distillate what i was what i was showing you that clear liquid that's 99.9 percent purity it's not just thc it's um isolated at the submolecular level to pull out just the delta 9 thc so now we have and because we do it by weight not by potency you've got these so this is a hundred milligrams right here you can see it even though colorado law says that you can only have 10 milligrams per serving what the package for this will say is that you're to separate each one of those into tents before consuming and again it's not um then eating 10 milligrams of organic material it's 10 milligrams of distillate here's um a granola what do you call like a graham cracker size thing with a thousand milligrams hundred legal servings and it'll say on it separate into one hundreds uh the problem is that young people just don't do that but does a nice job of getting them to be returning dedicated customers look these have a thousand milligrams of sodas cake pops chocolate bars this industry is insidious and this industry doesn't have regulatory bounds and nobody understands it well enough to actually go in and regulate it and say hang on what exactly is in this poo tang pi cannabis that's being sold as medical um how is it being how are we assured that it is not full of things that i shouldn't have in it how are we assured that it actually has the potency it says that it does and that we're so far behind in our understanding of it they're just kind of doing what they want so ketchup and hot sauce coffee k-cup coffee thc infused lemonade ice cream and candies granola bars thc infused nasal mist topical intoxicating thc thc um pills so you can swallow and get high thc infused lollipops thc teas little uh gummies there's things made to look exactly like other candies obviously with 100 milligrams of thc in it pot rocks it's not a joke that's a real thing again very clearly not being marketed to the 40 year old responsible user because i'm not psyched on sour apple pot rocks i think my kids would be and they know that there's uh keef cola makes a soda with 350 milligrams of thc in it you can actually get for less than that now um and a little warning label on it that says separate it into 30 fifths uh 35 servings and that is what that little cap is right there 135th so go ahead and put keith cola into youtube tonight and see how many of those kids are separating it in the 35th if you keep up with rap culture at all here's your pre-made thc syrup and i thought that was pretty incredible there's thc water seems to me to be the apex of things the point being once you've got this commercial market in place everything that can be put into your body is going to be made with thc in it that means you know how are you going to tell if somebody's eating a regular candy bar or a 350 milligram thc candy bar um the liquid thc if the five hour energy they just took is five hour energy or if it's actually thc there's a intoxicating underarm applying thc here's thc breast spray the list goes on and on and on let's move to mental health consequences associated with casual use so casual use and uh for this particular incident we're looking at uh 10 to 12 percent thc 10 to 12 percent and we know the higher the thc the higher these numbers and this is the part of this that i just listen if we decide to move down this path in this country fine and it's what i said in my book i think that there are probably better things to spend our time and treasure on but if this is what we decide that we want to do in this country fine we just have to be honest about the risks associated with because it's being sold all the time as this perfect there's no issue everything's great um cow why didn't we think of this 50 years ago sort of a thing when that's not honest uh because the the mental health implications that are associated with this are fairly significant and they're things that every single day of the week um i'm seeing and working with and to to you know write this off is to write off the suffering of a lot of people with significant mental health issues that are either complicated or created by their thc consumption so the risk of depression is 1.4 times increased with casual use we do not have any idea if that is causal so do more people consume because they have a depressive disorder or do you get a depressive disorder when you consume more don't know the answer to that we know that acute anxiety is causal causal so we know that uh in in the higher the potency it would seem the more acute or the the louder the acute anxiety is so we know that um somebody who tends to be anxious to begin with when they are consuming these higher potency and higher potency here i mean i'm talking about like 10 and certainly it escalates and escalates from there um that it causes acute anxiety there is an increased risk of anxiety disorders we don't yet know if it's causal um we'll we'll see what happens with that one i think kind of uh common sense is going to tell us something there but we'll wait for the science to hash that one out you have considerably worsened outcomes in treating bipolar disorder um a pretty brilliant psychiatrist who i know um who spent a lot of time considering and thinking about this said uh what what i think it has to be is that um this higher potency stuff is kind of always changing the chemistry of the brain in unpredictable ways and so it makes it very difficult for us to keep up with um balancing medications for it and then the risk of attempted suicide requiring hospitalizations which is sort of the big measuring factor because we can ask a person questions there we know it was um a very serious attempt but they're uh not deceased so we can probe into it a little bit the risk of suicides requiring hospitalization is twice as likely and somebody who consumes casually which should sort of be the end of it if you look at colorado's numbers this is i wish everybody who was thinking about this would do if you just look at colorado's numbers causation correlation i don't know and we will never know but we have never recorded higher teen suicide rates in colorado than we have the last six years we have never recorded higher overdose rates from opiates than we have the last five years so this isn't this thing that you're going to introduce and everything's going to get fixed use of any cannabis at all is associated with one and a half time increased risk in psychosis so psychosis is kind of this big generic word for um the pejorative would be crazy but for mental illness and it can show up in a lot of different ways and regular use so uh twice a week would be associated with a twofold increased risk of psychosis and again here when when we took when if you look at this third bullet point when we're talking about high potency i want you to keep in mind that we were talking about a 12 so higher potency cannabis more frequent use and genetic susceptibility so the presence of those can increase your risk of psychosis by eight fold listen if if there was like a chemical that was found inside of this coffee cup that i'm drinking from right now that did one fifth of this there would be a ban on it tomorrow an absolute across the board band until we figured out what it was because um we finally are starting to wise up and care about mental health um in this country a little bit and um to have setbacks like this is pretty ridiculous so any use before the age of 18 sees a two and a half time increase risk in the diagnosis of schizophrenia that risk increases as dosage increases so probably pretty causal so here are the acute physical health and i'm going to just run through these because i want to talk about the testing impaired memory motor coordination react time singular focus reduction and perceptual accuracy those are all very very very important skills when it comes to driving and if you you look into so everybody keeps good numbers on this the rocky mountain hydra report high intensity drug trafficking area has some great numbers but um so so do all of the um departments of transportation and all legalized states and the uh traffic safety institute um the the rate of our um fatal crashes where the driver is positive for thc is you know it's a line on the graph that just goes straight up um these are things these are skills that you need for driving and working so here's the issue with it uh chronic use for pregnancy i'm sorry but i have to run through it because i want to make sure we get our time going here so here's the testing and driving you cannot measure impairment any other way than with a dre a drug recognition expert that's a specially trained member of law enforcement who's going to put somebody through about half an hour's worth of um tests physical tests to just to see if they're intoxicated or not because um thc is fat soluble we have seen it stay measurably in a person's system for up to 72 days with marilyn heuses look at a beautiful wonderful elegant study um so we also have found as you're seeing people say things like well we'll be able to test this way and don't worry this product is going to come out that law enforcement will be able to do a roadside the method of ingestion makes that whole thing moot we can tell when somebody has smoked but as you saw a tiny little sample of there's so many ways to consume that aren't smoking where it ends with us is that the presence of thc inside of somebody's system be that urine hair uh blood the presence of thc does not indicate intoxication and colorado has decided on five nanograms per milliliter is our benchmark for sobriety or 0.08 equivalent if you will less than five nanograms per milliliter does not indicate sobriety so you may ask okay well if if under five nanograms doesn't indicate sobriety and over five nanograms doesn't indicate intoxication how do you determine intoxication back to the first bullet point you cannot measure intoxication other than done by a dre so you could have a person who consumes on friday night goes into work on monday alongside somebody who was consuming the entire way into work that day or who ate an edible and they could be involved in a workplace accident both of them are going to test the same depending on the way that they test and how things go one of them clearly intoxicated one of them not but as soon as you change the laws of the state where it's a person's right to have thc inside of their system um everything changes and i will tell you guys the uh maybe it's because it's early and i'm um tired and i just saw how old i look in the mirror versus how young i looked in that picture maybe there's just not a lot of time anymore i'll tell you that until we have a reliable and responsible way of measuring intoxication at the roadside anybody who moves forward with this this is checking a box being okay with more intoxicated driving and i really don't think that in the 21st century i have to make much of a case about why driving under the influence isn't a good idea here are a couple of places to look please um i'm a board member with these guys sam smart approaches to marijuana much more politically minded um more politically minded than i am but uh good place to start if you're interested in getting involved nida the national institute for drug abuse samhsa smart colorado is a group of moms basically that um personifies the buyer's remorse um who have joined together to try and tell other people what's going on and then just make sure that you use a critical eye when you're looking i subscribe to probably every single pro cannabis newsletter and website on the planet just so i can keep up with things and just remember that the more money is involved in something on either side uh the more apt people are to sort of twist it to what they want to do there's a copy of my book it should be your barnes and noble um amazon wherever i don't think it's a particularly good book it's not high art um but uh i think there's some helpful information in it 7 30 nailed it questions awesome job ben you did it thank you so much great stuff um we have some really great questions um i want to start with a comment though that's um quite heartbreaking and i want to thank this person for sharing this this person said thank you so much for telling the truth about marijuana our son died by suicide in april he had marijuana induced psychosis there was no convincing him that marijuana was the problem and the treatment center that he attended failed to deal with the root issue even though we shared with the physician and social worker that we could see that marijuana abuse and psychosis that company were the problem and i'll just say that you know i um i'm assertive judy and i are both certified family recovery specialists i i facilitate a support group every week i've been doing that for nine years the support group thing ten years really um a week doesn't go by that somebody isn't lamenting the the fallout certainly not always to this extreme and again we're so sorry for your loss um but it is it is just um infuriating when i hear people say nobody ever died from overdosing on marijuana well first of all an an overdose does not necessarily mean death and overdose means toxicity you can overdose from a lot of things i can overdose on aspirin you know so that doesn't mean you're going to die but it's certainly what i'm really seeing is the the loss of motivation and the loss of connection to the family the isolation i mean our kids do not need to be isolating more than they already have to right now social media is contributing to that let's not add something that that one of the number one side effects of using this substance is lack of motivation apathy that sort of thing so um i just want to say this is a truly serious topic and when people say you know it's not fair to to incarcerate someone of course we agree with that but it's also not fair to minimize the effects that this has on a young person that's the end of my speech about that but i really want to thank this person for sharing that well said and um cannabis induced psychosis is a very very real thing and a very loud problem and i'm so sorry um we see it every day here too i'm so sorry kim i can go through these questions the pre questions that you want or we can run through the ones i've tried to answer some of them how do you want to do it well let me just say that that um a question that came up a lot is how do we help our community members understand this share this video this if if this doesn't help explain the the potential you know challenges i don't know what will so please share this video um and i did load ben's powerpoint on that page that i mentioned the video will be there later tons of resources are there and for for folks that are asking about parenting and the challenges of convincing our our sons and daughters um and by the way judy and i both had those conversations several years ago with our sons um who are thankfully in recovery today but um that program on october 27th is going to address a lot of that that is going to be very specifically about parenting so that's on our online page so again check that out but ben i think if you want to pick some of those um advanced questions that you'd like to address go right ahead so let me run through the advanced ones because um you guys sent those in and then i'm looking at the other ones i'll get to those as well um the how can communities be helped to understand that marijuana use can be harmful i think that the most important thing is that we all just keep having honest conversations and then we not shy away from um the pushback that you're gonna get with folks because a lot of the times especially somebody who the the circles that i roll in and travel in um tend to be a little bit more on the left leaning side most of the time when you bring this up you know folks like whoa hold on what are you talking about just um be willing to have the awkward and uncomfortable conversations and know that if you got the facts behind you let the pundits be the pundits and let the the people who are just trying to profit off of this uh do and say their thing i think it's our job to move this conversation into a more intelligent place so how how can you help and especially about seeking treatment so this is listen not all treatment is created equal in another life i spent a lot of time and then still in some ways continue to spend a lot of time making sure that people in my industry are actually doing a good job with it look look into the program really well ask him some hard questions and and here's the bottom line um this is something that uh for me it's 12-step work um i'll put my email address inside one of these things if you've got questions specific questions about how to help a kid um i i would be more than happy to either walk through that with you or to put you in touch with somebody who can help with it because um that's the way we stay sober is doing those things i thought this was a wonderful question how do i balance my support for decriminalization of cannabis and my concern that the damage that frequently being high has on people i support the decriminalization of cannabis i i have written this for for years for for pushing a decade now that i don't see any issue at all with decriminalisation decriminalizing possession and realistically um we had de facto decriminalization in colorado prior to this whole like all these people were arrested sort of a thing um they were fined i mean anything under two ounces of cannabis in colorado was a hundred dollar fine and most of the time it was dismissed like you would a traffic thing but that's what they were calling arrests so i don't think that there is any problem at all with supporting decriminalization of a thing and saying no to the industrialization of it this is where i think the vernacular gets super duper important when everybody says we want to legalize um yeah you don't uh most of the politicians who are involved in this thing when uh the when decriminalization comes up their lobbyists push back hard and they say well no decriminalization is not really a solution the only solution is you know letting us make hundreds of millions of dollars in doing it and and that's just uh ridiculous the efficacy of this drug and behavioral health treatment per diagnosis so um pretty much every behavioral health you could condition you can think of um uh ptsd uh adhd and then certainly the more severe ones bipolar disorder depressive disorder anxiety thc is contraindicated for the use with and we certainly would not some want somebody using it um you know like freely like take as much of this uh as often as you want for as long as you want it would be done in a physician-monitored uh way with an actual prescribable medication one of the big things that people miss is that um one cannot prescribe a marijuana it can't be done it's a schedule one controlled substance the way that your law is written um allows a physician to recommend the use of but you can't prescribe that somebody smoke a plant because that's not how it works in this country things go through fda approval and fortunately like thank god because some of them are doing some amazing things we have some fda approved cannabis cannabis-based medications because there absolutely is medicine inside of the cannabis plant absolutely there is the trick is to separate it out and to give it to folks effectively but um to use smoked cannabis is an intervention for behavioral health issues is a no-no um is it possible to help our adult kids understand how weed and other substances is negatively affecting their lives yeah absolutely it is everything is possible uh and and i think the the first thing that we have to do is to get a little bit educated on it um i really i for the most part was tired of traveling and wanted to be with my kids and that's why i wrote that book and i have a chapter in there called something of that effect you know how to argue with a 17 year old or how to talk to your kids or something like that um there are lots of effective ways to do it and i'll tell you that the the first recommendation that i'll give you is don't come into it angrily don't walk into that conversation when things are bad don't walk away from something like this with information that becomes weaponized and yell and confront and holler i've i've always found that the very best way to have hard conversation during good times is to sit down with the person i love uh at a place that they really enjoy and feel comfortable if it's a dinner if it's outside if it's it and then to try and bring it up when we come into them with um anger what they hear is that anger when we come into those conversations with genuine love and concern it's much easier for them to understand that um so that this is in my opinion is cannabis addiction most similar to alcohol addiction or does it have a a different effect so what you use is just diagnostic criteria for them the symptoms are obviously very very different the lethality associated with alcohol alcohol is far and away the most um dangerous substance inside of this country unless you were to count tobacco but um from immediate deaths and uh it's not necessarily that alcohol is way worse than all these other things it's just more commercialized and used so we covered that one you asked how can we convince the legislators that legalization doesn't increase revenue you just simply show them the numbers um that have come out of colorado california everybody else and then um you you hope that they actually look at that and don't get pulled into the political discussion um there was a for somebody i got you kim for somebody who really wants to understand that question there was a brilliant researcher who sat on the pro legalization side of this thing who unfortunately passed away uh two years ago i think named mark kleiman out of the university of washington and dr kleinman had dedicated the last i think 20 years of his career into trying to determine exactly how you could adequately tax this vice substance to pay for the the impacts of it without just building the black market up and as you've seen colorado california all these places that have big commercial industries our black market has um dramatically increased it hasn't decreased it's increased since so where dr kleinman came up with um what was almost an impossibility like to tax it at a high enough rate that you would make up for the costs associated with you would just create a black market to tax it at a low enough rate um to get rid of the black market you wouldn't even get close to it you have to look at tobacco and alcohol as the paradigm any vice any by substance so we've got 60 years worth of data and for every dollar that we earn in taxing alcohol it costs us about nine dollars and for every dollar that we earn in taxing tobacco it costs us about eleven dollars societally kim i was just going to add thank you those are really great points um on our on that follow-up page the cannabis page um judy put together some talking points i also shared that piece that jeff has together that jeff hanley mentioned at the beginning so also a finder for how to find your legislator so that i think is the most important thing you can do and they should be paying attention right now because if you haven't noticed it's election season so what uh what kind of tax structure do you recommend for concentrate thc products um i am sort of a you you figure this out and i don't live there uh don't tell me in colorado what to do which was what pissed me off because like all the people who were pushing this were from california and stuff when they came out um and so i'm gonna let you guys make up your own decision on that well in just about everything but this is why i'm fr concentrates just have no place in the world none like they don't belong until we have a much better understanding of what they are doing to the human brain and body the only place that they have any worth is in the portfolio of the cannabis industry they don't belong in a person's brain or body so what is my suggested tax rate for that none because don't sell it because when we're selling it we're just kind of pandering to what it is they want to do um how did i overcome my struggles i just woke up one day and everything was better uh what no it was awful um a lot a lot of 12-step was what did it for me um i got involved in that world and that's a very long and um interesting story that took place a lot of it between pennsylvania and washington dc um but uh what they say you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired and eventually i just got that gift of desperation where i i i wanted something else um inevitable got that one got that one okay why are states putting this question on the voters ballot if the lessons from colorado show it's a bad idea when's the last time we did things that made great political sense i i don't care which side of this thing you're on if you like the dude from reality television or if you like the dude who's been in politics for 50 years i don't care who you're going to vote for i'll ask you do we really have a choice between the finest two americans when his politics made sense and the reason why these things end up on a ballot is because you have massive commercial industries behind it and those industries can get anything they want to on the ballot i've joked before that if you give me enough money i'll bet you i can get on the ballot and convince enough coloradans that um in order to keep our fires at bay here we should sacrifice a puppy every monday in town square give me enough money to sell that message and you can sell anything um ben i just think we need to note that in pennsylvania we're not talking about a ballot issue we're talking about legislation so it could happen without anybody's input other than the people in harrisburg you know the only people who've done that so far quick little trivia here the only state so far who has passed legislatively anybody illinois no illinois people of pennsylvania you could put yourselves up right next to the state that brought us everything else that takes place in illinois um okay i'm gonna run through the questions that we have here i didn't think medical marijuana could be prescribed to children until i did an assessment so again i'll um make sure you get the vernacular uh straight on it you cannot prescribe marijuana can't be prescribed and i don't know what the specific laws are in colorado um you can be under 18 and get a recommendation here judy do you know the answer to that one or jeff yeah it is illegal in pennsylvania for anyone under the age of 18 however a caregiver can get registered and on behalf of of the um their their child or half of the youth of the year there are some fda approved medications that um one in particular that can be just fantastic for children especially children with a very rare um seizure disorder um called epidialex and so that is a cannabis derived medication that is prescribed often to young kids well i mean often there's probably a couple hundred kids in the entire state on maybe maybe 100 kids in the whole state because of such a rare condition but other than that no nobody's telling a kid that they should smoke something so explain how tolerance is different from alcohol so here's going to be your i'm going to give you a two-minute answer to a 20-minute question um you get to a point of tolerance with alcohol where your body doesn't let you get any more tolerant we've seen this um jaundice liver failure kidney failure etc you get to a point where ethanol so saturates things that um you're just not able to keep putting it in because you'll die and then ultimately um you it'll take you less and less and less alcohol the further you go down the spectrum to get intoxicated because your body's no longer processing it well enough the difference with thc and one of the because there is no uh lethality associated with overdose from it works very very differently it saturates and binds to cannabidiol receptors rather than um anyway so what ends up happening is we just over saturate those receptors and over saturate those receptors and different from the other drugs particularly alcohol you have cannabidiol receptors throughout your entire body i mean almost every little bit of you has these receptors inside of the top of your head to your toes and so what we'll end up doing is um creating a um a need for introduced uh thc to bind to these receptors in in such large amounts that what your body produces naturally won't be able to bind to it so um the way that it's different is the tolerance is essentially unending like you can just keep getting more and more and more and more tolerant um i i really encourage you to watch some youtube videos and you guys have seen me before you know my favorite guy is um somebody called stoner's r weed um and because he has a program called kill a friend day where he gives people his first their first concentrate hit but the thing that's so interesting about him is he consumes concentrates regularly and you can see people who the first time they consume a concentrate um acute psychosis passing out go crazy you see a blood pressure spike and things like this and then you see people who've been consuming concentrates for a little bit they can consume and consume and consume and have no noticeable affect change so you can keep going forever withdrawal symptoms probably the easiest thing for you to do is just google that they'll give you those um definitively the the most frustrating ones that we see for people are um sleep uh and anxiety and diet issues but uh anxiety and aggression are pretty big ones too you mentioned deaths and seems and and seem to imply that there have been overdose deaths caused by over consumption of thc are there such cases no not really i mean there's like one or two in the literature but i think they're probably pretty crazy uh and weird little one-offs however to say that no one has ever died as a result of is asinine it's to say that no one has ever died of tobacco because no one has ever overdosed from it to say that no one has ever died from um falling asleep at the wheel because they didn't overdose falling asleep at the wheel people died doing dumb things when you're intoxicated you tend to do more dumb things and there is case after case after case in colorado i wrote a chapter about it um even back then about the people who who took the lives of others directly because they were intoxicated so no uh overdose not a thing it's not a thing uh you're not gonna overdose from thc for those of us not experienced in this area can you explain how butter wax and chatter would be consumed i understand vaping yeah yes but is shatter smoke like crack yes it is it's a rock um so you would smoke it uh like you would smoke anything else in rock form so vaping is obviously the easiest because there's no associated smell with it um but it's a hot knife it's a superheated needle um that's that's how you do that judy would like to answer this question live is that what it said no no you would like it yeah isn't there some controversy about the study that showed association with marijuana use and schizophrenia and teens um so it's not a study it's multiple studies at this point like multiple and um no no there's no controversy unless you want people to allow your industry and the the controversy is going to come from the people who are waiting to profit on it what can scientist researchers do to contribute to this issue um we have a couple of pretty brilliant minds here in colorado working on some large long term which you must understand is the importance of longitudinal um as opposed to um quick short-term ones and the information that we need more than anything we're getting in utero and early life exposure data right now uh our university of colorado hospital and dr apollo riggs but what we really need is more and better long-term understandings on brain and um body everything below the shoulders of of actual high potency so not 16 uh that's that would be the the most important thing the other thing i would be particularly interested in is the sociology around um there was a book in if for those of you in the medical or scientific world um springer who publishes the medical textbooks that our doctors um use when they're in med school to uh to to to it's where all the textbooks are this year they published cannabis and medicine and uh it has uh experts from every single field of medicine um explaining interactions with drug drug different all sorts of stuff from every field of medicine and um i actually got to co-author the section on treatment and recovery from and one of the things that we could use some more research on um is recovery from as well as drugs what specific regulations would you recommend limiting location of cannabis stores advertising potency i wrote all of that in the book so again more commercials for it which i usually suck at doing but i make a buck 50 every time you buy one of those unless you buy you so go ahead and i think i stopped charging you guys long ago to do this so i'm a book um but i wrote about that it needs to be a progressive policy of um discipline that's associated with until you eventually get to a point where the economics of it don't make sense for them to do it anymore but i i wrote all about how i would do it did i miss him me comparing how the recreational legalization will affect the medical field no because i didn't really do it and i think that's probably way better asked um of your experts um here in pennsylvania who have a better idea i worked for an alternative school in pennsylvania we had an intake interview with a student who was prescribed medical use by a doctor so again um recommended versus prescribed um he just like every other pennsylvanian just like every other american cannot be prescribed cannabis they can be prescribed cannabis medications or recommended cannabis my advice to law enforcement officers when talking to students and parents about marijuana is to be as informed as possible i think a lot of the times when when we come at them and they hear old guard they shut down when you know if we're not up to date on the language and you know if if we come in and we're like hey you know you kids and your reefers and you're smoking on your mary janes and you're if if we're not informed and if we don't understand what it is they're actually consuming they're going to write us off and not listen to us at the beginning so i i guess um it's this it's the balancing the fine line between trying to be cool when we're not cool i don't know maybe maybe you're totally cool fred i like i'm not at all so i don't try to you know use words and be like yo kids this presentation is going to be straight fire you know y'all should hashtag you know what don't do that [ __ ] um what i do is just try and be me but also try to be informed so i would recommend sir um that you you just be hip to and aware of what it is they're doing and then um go into it asking questions more than telling and then if you've got enough decent information you can um you can feel those questions well the other thing i will tell you is as somebody who part of my living amends is trying to to make up to for the the crappy stuff that i did uh that involved law enforcement down there um you call me absolutely any time uh and oh here let me put my email in here and i'll help um if it's specific stuff if it's not i'll help you any way i can because um i have a great respect for the work that it is that that you and your fellow officers are doing and i thank you all for it that's all the questions fred there's my email address uh what am i missing uh there were actually a couple in the chat box that we didn't get to the definition of casual use actually it's not super well defined we would we're using two times a week okay and just for clarification you cited that that study from australia earlier um just kind of looking like is this really real 30 is now the rate of addiction can you clarify that yes it's really real um so the study is it was funny kim when you sent me the link the pubmed link it had that other researcher's name on it um uh i had seen the original publication with wayne hall um at all who is sort of the one of the leading thought leaders about but yes it's absolutely real and it's not some uh dr volkov at nida said three years ago and she was saying publicly three years ago just just wait you're going to see 30 40 addiction rates once the science can actually show what we're seeing on the streets and the problem is to get journal published peer-reviewed science takes time to throw out some sort of tagline and and quick little answer to something takes no time so science takes time wonderful uh we are i can't believe it's 10 o'clock this has flown jeff do you have any last uh thoughts comments no no no kim thank you again for having me and i appreciate it ben can you um can you provide us with a citation somebody asked for the guy from washington mark clyman about the taxation of the substance can you can you get that to us sometime so that's a summary of about 20 years of work for him so look into who mark kleiman is and read his research i i i think it's k-l-e-i-m-a-n um okay brilliant brilliant guy uh but totally sat on the us thought we should fully legalize thought we should fully allow for commercial sales um so somebody who you know he and i would be on opposite sides on the panel but brilliant researcher and um really couldn't quite get there okay thank you just put a put a link in the chat box yeah so um ben we can't thank you enough that was fabulous and um you're such a dear um treasure for all of us so thank you thank you to everyone who joined us we had more than 100 folks with us consistently this morning um which is amazing so thank you all very very much uh jeff ben judy thanks great being with you have a good rest of your day everyone follow up on that page oh and take our survey please when this ends take our survey and follow up on that page conversation dot zone slash cannabis bye-bye everyone thank you bye thanks kim talk to you soon thanks so much", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "Pg5Q82qmupo": "baby we are off to the races okay so we were supposed to talk about opioids and uh then we didn't and then i said we would talk about opioids today and now we're not going to we're going to talk about weed instead but we're going to use the recap from last time um real quick what are some chronic or some risks of chronic ketamine use like you are using it regularly on a consistent basis what are some organs that can be impacted i see bladder issues slash blood or sad slash bladder toxicity and i love the fact that all three of you said it differently that's great what other organs might be impacted or processes might be impacted by using ketamine chronically liver yeah it's possible it's possible that one is like in the realm of things that we're still in the process of researching and figuring out more about because it's possible that liver toxicity can only happen from like really prolonged heavy doses not positive there but it's good to keep an eye out for what other memory cognition yeah um there is a possibility that in people that use like really heavy chronic quantities of ketamine there could be memory deficits that appear to be reversible olney's lesions have been not shown ever in humans and all these lesions were the thing that caused the big scare about ketamine and relative dissociatives that act on that specific glutamate receptor which glutamate receptor is it what's it called nmda that's right is the audio distorted problems okay sorry orion isolated case we call that an outlier in data sets um and the other thing that i'm thinking of is another part of your urinary tract what is another major set of organs that helps process your pp come on yeah kidneys that's right so um your kidneys your liver basically your pee stuff your filtration system the brita filter of your abdomen is what could be potentially put at risk from doing high doses of ketamine chronically your bladder though is at a much higher risk than specifically your bladder although your entire urinary tract could be at risk but like your bladder is the main thing that you really want to look out for so keep an eye out for that okay so we have kidneys urinary tract your brain sickle if you if this is really like if you do a lot of ketamine really often then you might experience memory deficits um and like i said it appears that this is largely reversible but no data set is fully complete because this is such a new practice and then the possibility of hepatoxicity um what are some neurotransmitters that are acted on by dissociatives there are four major ones that i'm thinking of right now dissociatives are the crossroads remember they act on a bunch of different things opioid nyselexus that is three of the major ones there's one more there's glutamate right that's the main one that dissociative act on is glutamate it's your connective your excitatory neurotransmitter it facilitates communication memory and learning allows the brain body to interact with each other to interface to collect information especially about pain signaling um so glutamate is disrupted it's antagonized its effectiveness is reduced by dissociatives um and there's the opioid receptors which are activated by a lot please make sure yourself if you just came in i'm gonna have to hunt you down i found you um opioid receptors are antagonized or sorry are agonized as well by certain dissociatives and different levels for each dissociative and then there's also dopamine and dopamine is one of those things that's kind of like here and there there are certain dissociatives that act more or less on dopamine so for instance pcp is considered to be more dopaminergic than other dissociatives and then there's also gaba which is your natural inhibitory neurotransmitter it slows your system down it's what's released in response to you getting hyped up it is your anti-fighter flight basically and i know that gets a little confusing because the technical opposites here are gaba and glutamate are opposite of each other gaba is inhibitory glutamate is excitatory but when i say that gaba slows you down a lot of people think oh that's the opposite of norepinephrine i want you to think of this more in terms of what excites your body and what inhibits your body's functionality basically or what inhibits your brain's communicativeness what excites your brain's communicativeness like facilitate like making connections reduce making connections that's what i want you to think of when you think of gaba and glutamate so the two g's really go together gg am i right what receptor causes bladder toxicity it's not a receptor issue so in the case of bladder toxicity one of the so this is the primary mechanism that i understand it working through at this point in time take it with a grain of salt and grain okay if you must because this is definitely something that i like the research is unfolding so this is what i currently know so like keep reading and doing your own research this could be proven wrong eventually so the general idea is that you have a little melon bladder inside your bod and the inside of your bladder is lined with epithelial cells which are these umbrella shaped cells that are responsible for protecting the blood vessels outside of your bladder from having seepage basically where the toxins and your piss get seeped into your blood vessels and distributed throughout your body basically so my current understanding is that ketamine um damages epithelial cells in your bladder so once little k particles get to your bladder which is like your your p is filtering toxins from throughout you know it's like nothing escapes your pee which is part of why i think that the idea of spitting the drip might not actually be that helpful because ketamine's in your bloodstream like even if you spit the drip before you swallow it like sure you might reduce some of the ketamine that reaches your bladder but i don't know if spitting the drip is really that useful especially because it's disgusting spitting the drip is awful you have to like and really hawk down a loogie and then somehow manage to spit it out while you're k-holed like it's very difficult so um yeah that's a preventative measure that you could take if you wanted to i mean it probably does not hurt except for psychologically that's a horrible experience what's a condition caused by chronic b vitamin deficiency it starts with an n that's right neuropathy that's correct neuropathy is uh tingling and numbness it's it's a kind of like nerve damage to your peripheral nerve that is often reversible in its early stages but at certain stages can be irreversible if you are like continuously pushing it and this is something that can happen pretty easily from using nitrous on a regular basis which is why i recommend that if you're doing nitrous in particular you should not do it more than like once a month realistically speaking or i guess i shouldn't put like a hard timeline on it instead i should say if you're doing nitrous it's probably better to binge in one session i say lightly like i'm not trying to advise you to binge on drugs in general but like if you're going to choose between using like a little bit for a long period or like one night and you really go ham you should probably choose one night and go ham just saying what is the neurotransmitter responsible for muscle control and i don't want this to be confusing i'm not talking about dopamine because dopamine is partly involved in muscle control it's also involved in mood but there's another one that we introduced last time it starts with an a yes that's right acetylcholine um glutamate's a good guess but glutamate is not the predominant neurotransmitter involved in muscle control glutamate facilitates like telling brain ouchy body hurt but acetylcholine is part of the reason like when you are on something like pcp you have a reduced control over your limbs it like takes a lot of effort to do stuff it's a sedative it knocks the [ __ ] out for surgery um which two categories of drugs can interact most severely with dissociatives umbrella categories where if you mix these with dissociatives you might have a bad time i see depressants hmm interesting choice of phrasing sedatives and stimulants so the word sedative is a little bit difficult here because both opioids and depressants as individual classes are sedating um uh no jared anyone can turn their video on who wants to it just appears that this particular batch today is not feeling very visual about themselves but i love seeing you all with your videos on so if you want to turn them on and like knit or like do paper mache or whatever it is that i interrupted with this like please feel free um i see stimulant and hallucinogens that's an interesting hypothesis so the two major classes that tend to react the most severely with dissociatives hi gabe are um opioids and depressants and the reason is that even though most dissociatives do not depress your breathing in the same way that something like an opioid or a depressant would they can still really compound the psychological and like high effects of dissociatives to the point where you get really bad spins or you puke and you choke or in some cases these combinations can lead to respiratory depression it depends on the specific dissociative that you're using in conjunction so generally speaking i would say that these categories do not play well together you should really stick to one of the three major like downer adjacent categories if you're mixing stimulants there isn't really anything particularly risky about yeah stims and dissociatives might give you anxiety stimulants in anything might give you anxiety i personally do not advise combining stimulants and hallucinogens of any kind just because or like okay no i changed my mind on that you can but i would be really [ __ ] light on the dose of stimulant that you use because otherwise you could really run the risk of like having physical anxiety which triggers mental anxiety and then you're looping and then that can actually create physical anxiety that becomes dangerous like arrhythmia level physical anxiety dipped cigarette wait can you guys still hear me okay sorry my airpods just tried to steal this no stims and sikes please yeah okay major note here is taking hallucinogens or stimulants okay doing drugs when you're sleep deprived is like a major major trigger for psychosis major sleep deprivation of like 48 to 72 hours you are in the danger zone like you are predisposed if you are hot if you're sleep deprived or if you're dehydrated you can very easily enter in a state of acute psychosis like and it's estimated that like three in every 100 people in their lives will experience psychosis like we really need to destigmatize this if someone was like i had a psychotic break you should be like oh like how can i support you not like oh man this person is going to spiral like be really mindful also yes you are correct hunter the answer is sure sherm embalming fluid lighter fluid it's not actually lighter fluid um what is the name for the medical term for pain relief starts with an a analgesia thank you uh acid and moly are usually okay either yeah there's no major contradiction between acid and moly what is this called this little guy okay well yes nitrous yes whip it but like what is this container called what's the slang term for it rooster thank you um which is the typical whipped cream dispenser so it's it looks pretty innocuous but like not actually everyone knows what this is and then we're going to ignore that because we didn't really talk about pending whoops and we're skipping that and going to the weed day because i want to be really mindful about doing opioid lecture correctly i've heard something about increased neurotoxicity when combining mdma and lsd i can think of no reason for that there is no neurotoxic profile of lsd there is no reason why this combination should have that effect that i can think of off the top of my head yeah candy flipping is generally considered to be a relatively low risk combination and synergistic as [ __ ] like you should reduce your dosage of both substances but i would say it's better to reduce your dose of acid than a molly because it really sucks to like not be fully rolling but also be tripping and acutely aware of the fact that you're not fully rolling is nexus flipping okay too 2cb and mdma that's nexus flipping for those either don't know hippie flipping is mushrooms in mdma candy flipping is lsd and mdma next is flipping is 2cb and mdma kittyflipping is ketamine and mdma the borax combo is 4h0mt2fa and and whatever nightmare flipping um 2cb and mdma again i can't really think of any significant interaction between those two dph and lsd i refuse to engage with that we're skipping all of that all right let's talk about the weed okay cannabinoids so there's some question marks about what the standard pronunciation for cannabinoid is um everyone that i've ever spoken to that works in the industry says cannabinoids there are occasionally people that say cannabinoids i'm gonna say cannabinoids and if anyone is like hello i work on the board of weed people and it's pronounced cannabinoids i will happily switch over but this is just like there are no conferences right now what am i supposed to do you know what i mean are thc and cbd um and i'm sure that probably all of you have heard of thc and cbd but what you might not have heard of are things like cbn and cbg and the other 113 or more cannabinoids contained within the weed like each of these cannabinoids has its own completely unique profile and it's a very complicated plant so much including yeah delta eight thc which and i do not know much about delta h thc so before you ask i just am not the authority on that subject leafly knows more than i do um but here's an interesting thing that's not in the slides as my tidbit of the day i might have already mentioned at some point this concept of the entourage effect so tell me if i've already covered this but the entourage effect is basically a theory that has notorious and complicated origins about how the reason that weed has such a robust effects profile is because it includes such a wide variety of different substances within each hit right so it's not as simple as just isolating a single compound from a substance and this is something that's like a subject of huge debate right now there was the question posed of whether the entourage effect was actually released as a marketing schema basically to get people to buy full spectrum products that include like all the colors of the rainbow like all of these different isolates from this from the cannabis plant has that much of an actual influence as opposed to oh my god this is so annoying my bluetooth is going crazy right now um sorry i'm reading the chat yeah so there's a big debate going on about the entourage effect and how far it applies bros in regards to the pronunciation of cannabinoids i'm just going off of the industry expert pronunciation i'm not pretending to be an expert on this particular subject i'm my interest area is primarily not in weed to be honest so um yeah you also wouldn't pronounce it canife and yet here we are in the english language being stupid stupid bits so this entourage effect question is really one that's being hotly debated because yes there are a lot of people that are reporting having a unique subjective effect from smoking weed that has everything in it including terpenes which we'll get to later as opposed to just like taking a gummy that has only cbd or only thc and it's pretty uncommon to get like only thc by itself and we'll see why in a minute um but the question is how far this extends because it appears to be like at least partially truthful that there is an entourage effect with cannabis probably um but when it comes to other drugs it really is like uncertain right now whether things like mushrooms in ayahuasca and peyote and mescaline containing plants and basically any plant medicine which is a phrase that i hate because most things derive at least apart from plants ask any of the decriminalized nature campaigns if they include cocaine in their decrim studies um yeah so the question extends to things like mushrooms and mushrooms are really interesting point to explore here because they have been recently shown to include um like a whole variety of different like sub compounds but we don't know how much those subcompounds actually contribute to the psychedelic experience so it's like do we need to bother trying to extract and combine all of the naturally occurring ingredients in mushrooms and is there any kind of actual actionable difference between taking mushrooms and taking straight up psilocybin capsules so stay tuned we're still learning more about this all the time i need to speed this up now um in response to you saying thc feels very steep stemmy to you whereas flowers and full spectrums feel a variety of ranges of things yeah it is definitely like the thing about that is that thc and cbd have alternate actions that balance each other out the question is how many of the other cannabinoids are really relevant to producing that effect if they're non-psychoactive so we'll come back to that in a little bit we'll elaborate so in your body you have a weed system you have an endocannabinoid system so this is like wow like your body is really just like made to accept substances to be honest and two of the major endocannabinoids that you have in your body are aea and 2ag which are largely responsible for things like feeding behavior and feeling good about exercising which is a thing that i wish i had more of and motivation and reward um and all of these things are like part of a very complicated system that is essential for regulating basically all of your life without naturally occurring weed stuff basically in your body you would be dysregulated as [ __ ] and we'll see exactly how that was proven by science in a second now scattered throughout your body there are two different kinds of receptors that accept endogenous cannabinoids the first is called cb1 it's predominantly found oops predominantly found in your brain and central nervous system but it's also found elsewhere and cb1 receptors are largely responsible for really influencing your neurotransmitters but this is not like other substances this is a very complicated science behind this that i've tried to distill into the least overwhelming overwhelming diagrams ever but they're still overwhelming so bear with me in a minute and then cb2 receptors are predominantly found in the immune system and elsewhere but like peripherally in your immune system and this is kind of like the first example of the interplay between these systems because you have cannabis or cannabinoids basically influencing your neurotransmitters as well as your immune response as well as your body's ability to respond to inflammation for instance like anti-inflammatory properties are one of the major things that are relevant in weed right now now the thing about these receptors is that generally speaking cb1 receptors i'll answer your question in a second cb1 receptors basically are responsible for decreasing another neurotransmitter that they're acting on so this is usually seen in gaba and glutamate and this is it's complicated i'm gonna try really hard to make it palatable but stop me at any time if it's not in a minute because it's so complicated um basically weed is the zen master of your body it's the one that goes around or the endocannabinoid system the cannabinoid system in general cannabinoids in your body go around are like hey man can we just like all vibe out for a minute this is getting a little excessive so it does that it like goes around and knocks on the door of a bunch of different neurotransmitters it's like hey can we like tone it down i'm trying to read this book by by rom das or whatever and then on the other side you have cb2 which is responsible for reducing inflammation and other stuff now the whole idea behind this system the tldr of the the endocannabinoid system is that it wants to maintain homeostasis if something is too hot if i uh oh my god if something is too high up it wants to bring it down that's the idea too much activity bro can't we just like all say stuff together right now in the brain here's where things get really complicated i have kindly procured some images of some birds for you so let's look at a glutamate neurotransmitter and then over here we have a gaba neurotransmitter we'll come back to in a second so here's the glutamate neurotransmitter we have our vesicles which are the bubbles that contain neurotransmitters so glutamate is stored in here we have our receptors down here we have um this thing which i'll get back to in a second and this thing which i'll get back to in a second so this is just like diagram of a neuron now usually neurotransmitters will be popped out of their bubbles they'll float into the synapse they'll bind at the receptor and something will happen right we know all about this this is the basics of how neurotransmitters work but when it comes to endocannabinoid system endocannabinoids are actually stored in the membrane of the neuron with the receptors so they're they're packaged in there next to the receptors instead of getting released and floating down to bind they get released and they float up to basically deliver a message they're like hey it's kind of loud down here can we like stop being quite so active it's really late guys and then you have something like a gaba neuron and it does the same thing it doesn't discriminate between like oh this is excitatory this is inhibitory now this means that there's like a really complicated a lot of double negatives in this system basically if you have endocannabinoids working on a glutamate neuron they're released back and they're like hey tone it down that means that they're going to release the excitatory nature of that neuron or reduce the excitatory nature of that neuron on the other hand if you have endocannabinoids on a gaba neuron they're going to go up and be like hey can you tone it down which will reduce the inhibitory nature of that neuron no matter what it's acting on it's reducing it so this is how weed can produce such variable effects this is like a wild way that it does a lot of like kind of sneaky backdoor things to make you feel this very unique profile of being high like honestly there are no drugs quite like weed like weed produces a really unique experience being baked and part of this is because if you are reducing glutamate's activity by being like hey calm down that could be an anti-anxiety thing it could be slowed reaction time on the other side of the coin if you're also going hey come down to gaba that can actually increase your stimulation like like you sometimes get that feeling of stimulation from being baked either socially or creatively or sometimes physically like pleasant body sensations and this is because you are slowing down certain things that are meant to connect you and also slowing down certain things that are meant to chill you out i know this is crazy i'll talk about sativa versus indica later the the spoiler alert is that they're actually like basically the same uh do you know how and why we'd evolved into growing with psychoactive chemicals in it was it to protect itself against predators i don't know sorry no idea so here's just like what is going to maybe be a little bit of an overwhelming depiction of how this works whoops surprise putin so for some of you you might be like this is obvious i get it you've explained it thoroughly for some of you might be i'm completely lost so i'm going to beat this horse until it's dead within the brain cb1 receptors are among the most abundant g-protein-coupled receptors however in contrast to classical signaling where information travels from pre to post-synaptic neurons the ecs uses retrograde that's endocannabinoid inflammation travels from post to pre-synaptic neuron it's backwards let's take a closer look at this mechanism using a glutamatergic neuron model that's a glutamate neuron when an action potential reaches the axon terminal remembering i know there's a lot of terminology you might not know that means electricity zaps it it's ready to pop stop sorry into acting as neural messengers oh my god i swear to you this is not my fault the ecs uses retrograde signaling the information travels from post to presynaptic neuron let's take a closer look at this mechanism using a glutamatergic neuron model when an action potential reaches the axon terminal membrane depolarization triggers the release of glutamate that basically means it pops the bubbles glutamate binds to post-synaptic glutamate receptors there goes glutamine calcium channels to open ignore that during periods of intense neural activity calcium accumulates in the post-synaptic neuron this calcium buildup causes the synthesis and release of endocannabinoids from membrane lipids diffusing across the synaptic cleft the endocannabinoids bind to the cd1 receptor all you need to know is that they're going up activation influences ion flow the result suppression of presynaptic neurotransmitter release endocannabinoids are subsequently taken back into the cell and enzymatically degraded okay so i know that that might have sounded like absolute gibberish to some of you tldr they're embedded in the receptor part like the next membrane they're embedded in the postsynaptic neuron and when there's a lot of activity happening that's basically their signal to like exit their sleepy caves and be like stop so they do that and the neuron is like sorry and then things calm down whatever neuron it is it stops doing quite as much as what it was doing um so let's take a look at this except with putin because it's been a while since we've had his presence here so basically endocannabinoids are these birds they're buried in the skin of the postsynaptic neuron now when there's a lot of activity or certain events happen or even just when you've been smoking weed which means that there doesn't even have to be a lot of activity for this to happen then these guys are alerted they're like oh man it's a [ __ ] storm up here and so they fly back up to deliver the signal of like guys keep it down please it's really loud like you're doing a lot of stuff right now it's too much and they'll be like sorry and then that neuron calms down basically so this is kind of like you got these endocannabinoids or whatever cannabinoids are in your system you might have just smoked weed which means that they don't even have to be triggered by a lot of activity in a neuron they can just come back and be like yo guys that's all vibe down and they basically stroke it and they're like so whatever it was doing it's gonna do less now this is called retroactive signaling so instead of neurotransmitters get popped and they float into the synapse and they bind it's the opposite they get released from the postsynaptic neuron they float up and they're like shh and then get destroyed yes it's a regulatory system i know that this is really like i don't know how complicated this sounds to you guys um but it somehow is even more complicated without all these metaphors so like hope it helps message the chat now because of this regulatory effect and because of the effect that weed has and that endocannabinoids have on your body's ability to self-regulate and do like feeding behavior and whatever scientists were like cool we could use this as a treatment for obesity let's just block the cb1 receptor let's just like make it so that cannabinoids cannot bind and like that should reduce feeding behaviors and they actually had to stop the clinical trials on this drug because of so many negative psychiatric side effects and for suicides so clearly cannabinoids in the body are really important for regulating essential systems the big idea behind this is that cannabinoids go backwards they travel up to whatever neurotransmitters sell that they're embedded in and they're like stop it like this is too much and it's basically giving feedback these are the messengers that are like too much that's fine too much that's fine and when you're introducing weed into your system you don't need a reason to say too much it basically can just go in and be like everybody vibe out calm down without a reason um now let's go into more specifics in terms of actual cannabinoids contained within the plant at least so thca and cbda are two such examples of this they are big fat molecules that get broken down by heat you can see that a little bit of it breaks off and with combustion that uh that group right there breaks off with combustion and that gives you regular thc and regular cbd or specifically regular thc is what we're really looking at here because i get asked the question a lot of can i eat weed the answer is you can eat anything you can put whatever you want into your body well you get high from eating nugs no and it will probably taste super bad although it's a really recent kind of like influencer trend that people are making like weed smoothies which sounds disgusting to be perfectly honest so part of the reason for this is that you need to burn off this group of thca in order to make it into the active phc i need to mute you if you're not muted um so this is part of why you can bake thc a and it will become thc that's why edibles work but you have to make them but thca and tb cbda are found in the raw plan the gist of thc sorry for all you that probably already know this gets you high giggles munchies your reaction time is slowed sensory information appreciated um quite a number of people experience paranoia from thc the higher thc content in what you are smoking or eating or ingesting or whatever the higher likelihood you are to have some kind of an uncomfortable experience anxiety-wise and paranoia like it's a correlation now legally initially thc was scheduled this is i just had to update this because as of december things are different so in the i don't know if you guys remember we'd initially talked about the single convention on narcotic drugs in 1961 the single convention was established this was the first international cooperative effort to shut down drug production basically and weed has been scheduled in schedules one and four this whole time and schedule one is basically like high potential for abuse some medical value two and three get progressively less stringent and then four for whatever reason goes back to being like high potential for abuse super addictive no medical value so it's kind of whack because like it goes one two three four which is like the most restrictive of all of them for whatever reason anyway the idea is that thc slash weed as a whole had been classified in schedules one and four and as of december of this past year the world health organization finally removed cannabis and cannabis resin from schedule four yay which doesn't actually mean all that much but like whatever um meanwhile in the united states we're sitting over here eating glue and using internet explorer because we currently have thc as schedule one which is indicative of something that has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical value and yet recently we managed to approve an fda-related regulated drug dronabinol which is thc for seizures and stuff so the hypocrisy is astounding and when we finish this lecture next time we'll look at the real like uh what's the scandal portion of this that has to do with asset forfeiture and patenting and like it gets like there's a rat's nest here so here are the the countries that in december um voted for and against this rescheduling you can see that like generally speaking it is more like white western countries that have predominantly supported this move um and there's like also abstinence from ukraine in this voting there's a lot of politics in this diagram like a lot of politics so study it well and you can really learn a lot about the individual drug laws of these countries based on how they treat something like rescheduling cannabis world health organization uh consistently gives me paranoid bad trips have minimal smoking years yeah that's really real like people really underestimate the fact that it's like like weed can really make you have panic attacks i know a lot of people that have had serious like hospitalization worthy panic attacks on weed in the last like six months i think the pandemic is making it worse though another cbd on the other end of the coin is non-psychoactive cbd does not get you high it does not get you high it does not have psychoactive properties um and the interesting thing about this is that cbd and thc are co-regulators the interplay between them balances out the effects of the other so cbd is more of the anxiolytic it's the calming it's the muscle relaxant whereas thc is very much more the like psychoactive component of things that is more stimulating and can be anxiety-inducing so the more well-rounded of a blend you have of thc and cbd the less likely you are to have adverse reactions such as paranoia such as anxiety so that might be something to take into consideration here now we won't go into all the specific cannabinoids that are contained within weed but it's really worth knowing that there are so many of them and they have a [ __ ] massive list oh my god how is it possible that every time i turn off all notifications and messaging platforms and there's always notifications that still have it anyway point is you can do research on these individual ones if you want to but there are so many things happening within the cannabis plan in fact so many things that are currently just being i have no idea where that sound is coming from i'm sorry like i have 150 tabs open i can't find where that's coming from so my point is lots of energy can have noise or cannabinoids sorry now looking at cbd this is a really interesting thing that happened um until 2016 cbd itself was not scheduled and then suddenly it was just like weed was scheduled but suddenly in 2016 there was a new motion to make cbd into a schedule one drug it basically was a motion that classified cannabinoid compounds like extracted from weed as being their own unique substances that were scheduled one as well to make it easier to crack down basically but then conveniently i'm going to go crazy i want to know where that sound is coming from but i can't quit google chrome because my life will fall apart and conveniently in 2018 epidiolex was just approved which was just like a cbd medication that was approved for treating symptoms of epilepsy like that's how it is you know we have this schedule one designation it is a facebook notification sound i just have no idea where i could possibly have facebook open right now anyway it's hypocrisy out the wazoo and we'll see that again later uh now talking specifically about weed a standard dose of how much we have left in this standard dose is like no one's going to measure out milligrams and weed i just have this here because i think it's funny there are a billion names for it there's weed if you're a boomer you might call it pot or i guess that's regional like on the east coast it's more called pot than on the west coast um dank or green or marijuana or sticky icky if you're really extra um there's just like so many names i can't keep up with them and usually someone will just be like baked or stoned or high or lit yeah ganja dank right yeah doo dang doinks uh it comes in many many forms it comes in flour which is um bud these are referred to as nugs this is like a crash course for people that just like don't really know anything about weed just so you know um then it can come in concentrate form this particular thing right here is a dab can be otherwise known as wax or butane honey oil or slash bho and we'll look at exactly what concentrates are because that's like sometimes people will pull out a dab rig to do a dab and someone will look at it like it's a [ __ ] like oompa loompa meth pipe and have no idea what it is so i want everyone to know what a dab looks like um and then in rare cases you might find a brick of afghan hashish this is really like not very common anymore though let us examine the nug so zooming way far on in on this bad boy we have trichomes and trichomes are these sticky little structures that contain the cannabinoids so the stickier your bud probably the more trichomes you have which means a higher packed concentration of cannabinoids within them this can be really annoying though because it really gets on your fingers um then you also have keefe and keefe is basically whatever residue is left over from grinding or handling weed it's basically it like shakes off the trichomes and this is just like a collection of trichomes basically so if you're ever with someone and they have like a bag of weed and there's like a layer of kinetic sand at the bottom and that person goes to throw out the bag it's pretty likely that everyone they're smoking with is gonna be like what is wrong with you because they just threw out like the highest concentration portion of trichomes because it's just like all the bottom now that um keef that like leftover that that shaken off sandy collection of trichomes is what gets pressed into bricks to create hashish so hashish is super concentrated with cannabinoids because it's literally just like mushing all of the cannabinoid containing crystal structures together um in terms of what you actually there's just so much terminology around weed just gotta catch up speed so in terms of like what the different qualities look like this is very much no longer as much of an issue in states that have regulated markets but let me tell you back in 2011 when eli had to roll up to your house in his shitty sedan you had to really know if you were gonna get schwag or mids or top shelf and it was almost always shake or miss [ __ ] you eli if you're watching this so uh shake or reggie or schwag or whatever you want to call it is just like bottom shelf weed it's like long and hairy and stringy and not very sticky and kind of ugly looking um then there are mids which is just kind of like middle of the road weed it's more dense snugs it's not anything particularly special and then you get fire or top shelf or dank or whatever you want to call it it's frosty like it literally looks frosty because of such highly concentrated trichomes the sticky crystalline chambers that contains the stuff that makes the magic happen and also often contains little orange hairs let's learn about concentrates concentrate is an umbrella term for any form of concentrated cannabis product everything from the traditional forms like hash to more modern additions like cannabis oil and distillates cannabis concentrates can be created and consumed in a number of different ways some are crafted using only heat and pressure while others utilize chemical solvents like carbon dioxide butane or ethanol all of these different extraction methods serve the same purpose to separate essential compounds we want the cannabinoids and terpenes from the cannabis plant the result is a potent product that contains all the things we love about cannabis but in a much smaller package while some concentrates can be smoked like traditional cannabis other consumption methods are much more common cannabis oils for instance are often found in vape pen cartridges or used as ingredients and edibles thick concentrates like butters or live resins are often dabbed or vaporized to learn more about the cannabis concentrates available at retailers near you check out the red and the reason i'm doing this is because i feel like concentrates are kind of like the unicorn of people not really understanding the next level of how weed works lots of factors can impact the quality of a cannabis concentrate but the first and most important rule is fire in fire out just as you need good ingredients to cook a gourmet meal high quality cannabis concentrates starts with superior cannabis cannabis extractions start with a trim run a nug run or a live extraction while both nug and trim runs use dried cannabis as their source material live resin extractions use fresh plants instead that's because one of the key components of cannabis flavor and effect terpenes are notoriously volatile they can even dissipate at room temperature live resin extractors aim to keep as many of those terpenes as possible present in their final product by running it before it's been cured no matter how they're extracted cannabis concentrates can be separated into two camps full spectrum extracts and isolates full spectrum extracts include a full mix of the compounds naturally found in cannabis including cannabinoids and terpenes in the exact same ratio you find them in the flower isolates meanwhile are pinpointed to extract one specific chemical from that profile usually thc or cbd while they may lack the nuance of full spectrum concentrates isolates are potent easy to dose precisely and make an easy way to add cannabis compounds to products like edibles or topicals some of the most instagram-worthy concentrates on the market today are known as diamonds rocks or gems typically these form when thca molecules clump together in a raw extract forming a crystalline faceted structure you'll often see thca diamonds paired with the liquid called sauce the sauce is the terpene-rich by-product of the same extraction process of course these are just some of the many cannabis concentrates available to consumers today to learn more about all the options you have for so it's so complicated like weed culture is really really taken off you know what i mean now we're going to learn how to take a dab with bucky who i love you would end up with butane left in your product which leaves a soupy mix that you do not want to smoke and these are the ingredients to a good dab session one rig filled with water a torch filled with butane of your choice a dabber carb cap dab or carb cap combination if you have it one quartz ceramic glass or titanium nail and the concentrate of your choosing the size of dab you take is up to your tolerance you should always start small and work your way bigger the average weight that you smoke is in the 15 to 25 thc range concentrates can range in the 65 to 85 percent range so make sure you know what you're doing before you inhale that's a big deal on the dabber it is time to heat your nail as you're heating you want to move the torch around to evenly coat the bottom of the nail as soon as you start to see a little bit of a red glow that's when you know the nail is hot enough after your nail is glowing red you want to let it sit for a few seconds when the nail is blowing red it is approximately 800 degrees you want to be dabbing at approximately 500 to 650 degrees the reason you let your nail cool down is if you take a dab too hot you risk hurting your lungs also you can burn your concentrates and ruin the thc that's inside if the nail is too cold you will not vaporize and concentrate properly either and you will not get the high that you are looking for to test the heat of your nail you want to use the side of your hand you want to be able to place your hand about half an inch from the nail comfortably if you are not able to leave your hand there comfortably it is too hot once it is slightly warm you are ready to dab when your nail is ready you want to place the dabber on the inside wall of the nail and let the concentrate slide off from the heat [Music] i love bucky teaching the world how to dab uh yeah so precise temperatures when you're dabbing are really really important for preventing yourself from getting like a really hot lung full of air and that can indeed damage the cells of your lungs like inhaling super hot air hurts for a reason like it's harsh yeah that is a very big dab um in terms of terminology continued like more there's just so much of it like i said a dime bag this is like again terminology that is phasing out because we have dispensaries coming into the play coming into play all over the country and the world right now a dime bag or a dime is ten dollars of weed my stepmom wants infamous infamously asked around the thanksgiving dinner table how much a dime bag cost was it twenty dollars just like completely unironically i think that was the same thanksgiving dinner table that she asked what prairie dogging was and we had to explain it to her so this used to be a dime used to be like half a gram of weed back in the day when eli would roll around in his sedan but now 10 bucks can you get to quite a lot more it can get you multiple grams of wheat in a lot of places a gram of wax tends to be more expensive i would say that prices have probably gone down since i last put this in which is used to be around like 20 to 40 dollars and i would say the prices are probably even even lower than this right now depending on where you're buying from right like a dispensary is obviously going to be differently priced than on the street and it really depends geographically on where you are and wax usually lasts a lot longer this is something that you would dab um and then there's an eighth an eighth of anything is three and a half grams so if someone buys an eight or an eight ball of anything an eight or an eight ball usually refers to like coke or other powdered substances like if someone's like i bought a ball of uh ketamine a that's kind of weird because people don't usually say that in reference to ketamine but you can and b it means three and a half grams it's just like as a standard unit of measurements it's an eighth of an ounce um there's a huge culture around growing weed right now the job of a trim immigrant is basically a seasonal gig where people will travel to certain regions of the country or the world that require people during trimming season to basically like pull the plants and trim the leaves off and collect the individual nugs and this often takes place in humboldt county california there's like a major immigrant culture there where people will just travel there and be like looking for work please hire me to trim your weed and this is kind of what it looks like you get a workstation this was pre-mask i literally looked at that and was like where is his mask because everything's falling apart a lot of weed cultivation takes place in north america some of it takes place in south america as well especially northern south america that's like a really large area of production as well as regions of africa there are a lot of native strains of marijuana cannabis whatever you want to call it um and then there's hashish production remember hashish like moroccan hash is like the the pressing of concentrates basically it's like a more analog version of concentrates let's see where we're at that's how you pick the weeds and here's the big question that has been asked several times here today is what really is the difference between cannabis or indica and sativa and the answer is not what you think there actually isn't because cannabis institute and sativa or oh my god shut me up indica and sativa don't actually refer to anything except for like the specific genus of cannabis plant so indica is like a short squat version of the cannabis plant it's all about the phenotype it's all about how it looks and how it grows and sativa tends to be long and skinny so it's like um i'm trying to think of like a muppet pairing like burton ernie maybe where one is like shorter and rounder and the other is taller and skinnier i don't remember what burton and i look like shame on me but it's like that basically i know that there's some dynamic duo that fits that bill so let me know if you remember one and the thing about this is that people have come to deeply associate indica as being like the sleepy the stony the more like calming and the more buttery and sativa to be the more creative and energetic and um like lively and the fact of the matter is that these technical terms only refer to how the plant grows the reason that we have a strain affiliation is because these plants have been intentionally cross-bred to create a specific cannabinoid ratio so basically how much thc compared to how much cbd and like the ratio of other cannabinoids within it as well so really what matters is not whether it's indica or sativa but the actual ratio of cannabinoids within it so if you've been finding in the past like oh sativa makes me all wired i don't get it you should maybe consider trying to find a source where you can actually see the ratio of thc to cbd um terpenes are more complicated i'm not the authority on terpenes but the gist of them is that they're kind of like the essential oils of weed they have their own properties that really do impact the flavor of it the smell of it but also the physiological components of it as well so terpene content really does make a difference in weed and that's part of the reason that you want a full spectrum concentrate uh specifically like a live live resin oh my god i'm like fizzling y'all i cannot remember the name the live extraction anyway the point is that you want to maintain the terpenes and that the cannabinoid ratio is really what determines things but people have intentionally bred sativas to have a higher thc ratio generally speaking and intentionally bred indicas to have a higher cbd ratio to make them stonier um then just like to make it clear what we're looking at here this is hemp hemp is basically like a a way of growing the cannabis plant i think the specif yeah specifically the cannabis sativa plant that is non-psychoactive hemp does not contain thc and it's a very sustainable resource there was actually a huge scandal about how a major paper company in the 20s tried to shut down hemp production and demonize marijuana because it was threatened by the feasibility of hemp being used as a really sustainable resource that could replace paper now there's not a ton of super yeah william randolph hearst there's not a ton of super concrete evidence that that was the specific motivation behind it but it seems fairly likely that that was at least partially involved here so remember wheat is different but hemp is in all kinds of stuff i used hemp's [ __ ] hand sanitizer getting my hair cut today at a salon in a tiny rural town in ohio like hemp is everywhere now wheat is infiltrating the masses so hemp is used to make all kinds of stuff i'm going to stop there for today i'm in oberlin ohio i'm going to stop there for today feeling a little bit tired today so i'm sorry if this was a little bit choppier than usual um thank you guys for tuning in we will finish cannabinoids and we're gonna get more into like the cultural the social element of things next time either on tuesday or i'm sorry on thursday or next tuesday i'm not sure if i'll be around this thursday i will let you know in an

be talking with josh who is featured in this month's brew box are flying high edition brew box and soon enough you'll see why josh actually uh started his own company cbrd i super excited for him to let you guys know about it and now that ties in to craft beer so josh tell the people what's up all right yeah so thanks for having me dennis um as you said i'm josh i am the um co-owner of cbrd which is a four milliliter single serve hemp shot uh that you can instantly infuse beer with a hundred milligrams of cbd so here's a little you know little little promo for us that i hand out to people um basically yeah there you go yeah got our got em yeah they're they're itty bitty um essentially you know the idea behind this is um you know cbd beer you can't really have um you can't brew cbd beer so this is sort of a workaround to be able to do it which is exciting um pour it in it disperses immediately and then sometimes you have to stir it for just a second yeah give or take depends on the beer and voila you've got yourself a cbd hemp infused with right under 0.3 thc beer and it is amazing i will say i have you know for market research purposes of course i tried this on a few different occasions with a few different styles of beer and every single time it did not disappoint it is amazing i know you know i know it affects everyone differently um with me what i did after a grueling you know few days of hitting the gym and working out i was like okay i want a beer let me go ahead and try this uh hemp shot and everything in there so i tried that and i felt relaxed and now i started reading you know different things and i personally my personal opinion i'm not a doctor a scientist or anything uh but it felt like it sped up recovery for me i slept a lot better i was so

and you know there's a lot of benefits for doing that but you know we found that a lot of people use this more for the fun you know they like to either realize they like to feel good and you know we pack it with um you know right right at that legal amount of that right at that legal amount of thc to where you're able to really enjoy it and moreover it's you know uh something that you can have at a brewery or at a bar or something like that and it feels a little more um i guess uh worth you know you don't want to pay six bucks for something at a bar and go man i didn't feel anything from that right right no yeah i felt it that's awesome [Laughter] without doubt uh i know on your end josh can you let the people know where you are and what beer are you enjoying today yeah so i um so i live in minneapolis minnesota um right in south minneapolis uh i don't know 10 minutes from the airport the business on all of our manufacturing and my co-founder is actually based in greenville south carolina so we are um you know so i'm fully remote and every other member of our team is based in south carolina so i go back and forth a good bit and then live up here i just like being up north more than in the south um i'm drinking a long route peanut butter porter which is excellent um it is by empyrean brewing company which is based out of lincoln nebraska um i got it just down the road in the uh beer store right down the street from me called elevated beverages which always has the best beer ever like no question like it's awesome they've got they get like crowlers delivered from all over town uh i can if i want to drink at home i'm certainly getting taken care of and they have a really good scotch selection i don't know if you like scotch oh yeah i'm more of a petey scotch fan so you like lagerville and laphroaig yeah aardbag like those guys like something that some people either love or they say it tastes like a campfire so it's like one or the other i want to drink i if i want it to be like a campfire that's just as smoky as pot i want to feel like i'm getting smoke in my eyes while i'm drinking my is what i kind of call it man do you and do you like smoke beers i do now what are those roush beers i believe they're referred to as like brodzitzki's is a popular style they're not super common i think it's an underrated style and i get it it's an acquired taste not everyone is gonna have a smoked beer and absolutely love everything about it but i think there is definitely a niche out there for it i just wish i saw more especially locally in uh pittsburgh and western pennsylvania but i just don't see that many smoke brews i don't see them here either the best one i've had is live oak brewing which is a really big brewery in austin texas yeah and they it's like 3.2 so you can like you know it's like you could drink like eight of those and you know his first is drinking like a 15 ipa or something crazy right yeah um right yeah so it's pretty sweet and then gosh i was in salem massachusetts for a sales trip and they've got a i can't remember the name of the brewery but that place that's all they did was smoked beers it's kind of like wonder how that marketing you know with that damn it yeah man go back up there yeah for real but you know just a whole brewery you know they was more than just that like lighter state like smoked browns and smoked porters and all kinds of stuff it reminds me of oxbow i want to say was that in portland sammy yeah portland and they specialize in everything says on like almost any kind of saison that you can think of they had there and i love places that have those specialties i like variety as well but it's always refreshing to you know someone who you know they just harness their craft so much in a particular style that every single one just knocks your socks off um speaking of that so the brew that i'm going to be digging into is gamehedge from insurrection ale works they are located in carnegie pennsylvania this specifically is a double dry hop double ipa i was feeling like you know sliding into some of those ibus today a little bit of bitterness but it comes in at eight percent abv really really tasty good color there good head retention very aromatic oh i'm definitely excited to get into this but again josh thank you so much for jumping on i'm excited to have a good conversation cheers and absolutely cheers i'm looking at carnegie right now just where it is because i didn't know where it was oh yeah really right outside of pittsburgh um but without further ado are you able to let the let the folks know like how did you get started in in the company that you have now see see beer the it's gonna take just for everyone out there knows i've been mispronouncing it for since may so for months i've just been saying see beard which is wrong josh let me know at cbrd um like so how did you get that start and what made you specifically think okay we need to start pairing these with beers like how did that start all right so gosh where do i even begin so i i would all of this sort of started with an interest in travel and um entrepreneurship which are two very don't have anything to do with beer and cbd so um so i'm a big craft beer guy always you know i'm pretty i'm 27 so i've been at it for like six years something like that yeah um yeah legally right yeah there you go i never touched it before that man no way and um i used to be a teacher so i have a master's degree in music um and used to be a music music educator and still you know still jam and play and do a little bit with it here and there um after i've always been interested in business guys you know i've experimented with all kinds of stuff selling t-shirts online and uh trivia um gosh what else have i done i tried to create like a travel agency one time and that was a brutal failure and then i got into um into music instrument rentals learned a good bit i worked with uh my mentor and boss there was a harvard business grad um and really legitimate guy and you know really knew how to run and i learned a lot about what does it take to run a company et cetera um and so switch from that and then started my own um virtual um basically digital marketing company and so um my niche was uh music stores i'm still working with a few of them now just a little bit here and there um to go and do things on my own um and my goal was to um do that and travel full-time so go around to europe and asia and all kinds of stuff like that and just travel around and work for my you know live that like digital nomad lifestyle kind of thing that you hear about like on the internet i thought it'd be pretty cool um in the process of doing that so my business partners name's joey he's my cousin um and he everyone has a cousin joey i feel like yeah absolutely yeah and so he um you know taught to me about you know we've always been close obviously since i've been born and uh he you know approached me about the idea of doing a cbd business and so um i said yeah sure that sounds great um we started with tinctures and i don't know if you know a whole lot about cbd but basically tinctures is sort of like the standard that and gummies are sort of the two standard ways to take cdd products we figured out right when launching a tincture brand we got a pivot this is so we got to do something different because if we you know the ten thousand five hundred and one tincture brain is not gonna succeed um i was in spain when we really started doing all that marketing and he was doing all the manufacturing i was a weekend i was like i can't do this i gotta come back this isn't gonna work so came back um and then while i was i was visiting some friends actually in pennsylvania we were sitting around our brewery and they were like we were like man i gotta come up with a cool idea they're like what if you at first they were like what if you do cbt and mix it in t i was like that's kind of cool and they're like what about c beer d that's kind of a fun name cbrd i was like i like that name and i looked it up and the domain name was available and i was like all right i'm buying it yeah we're doing this and so you know at first we thought about doing this as like a um like a 15 milliliter you know like a half size thing that you like sell and you put your beer and then we figured out like a different you know went to the drawing board and created a formulation that where it does that infusion process because if you take a tincture and you pour it in it's going to rise to the top and crystallize and that's not you don't want that in your beer yeah that's that'll be gross in your beer um and so you don't want to do that and so you know that's joey what he does he's the science guy and has the um you know he has a big facility from other businesses that he owns and so worked through that and you know came up with the right thing and then the you know signature four milliliter you know the little mini single serve shots um and you know that was really what we thought would be a game changer because it's at a price point that somebody will walk in somewhere and be like oh cool this looks kind of neat i guess i'll buy one for right right yeah you know it's something that fits as an impulse buy so you don't have to like a customer doesn't have to feel like they have to commit like 80 bucks to you know no one on earth is going to go into a liquor store and pay 80 bucks for some random thing they see on the counter that's not rival but something that's six bucks yeah it's like oh i kind of like getting a little crossfaded while i drink yeah sure i'll try one right so they they go and get that and what you know and kind of voila that's what we've done from there and we've pivoted around so much you know having just him to learn how on earth do you sell cbd on earth do you sell beat you know talk to beer people how do you talk about brewery owners and you know man it's just i mean it's a hustle but you know we're starting to figure it out and learning a little bit more about um you know what people like and more importantly we've got a great product and you know when you've got a good product if you can figure out how on earth to speak to people it's going to succeed so absolutely now i definitely agree if i walked in somewhere and i saw a little you know 100 milligram like ready to rock and roll something to end to the beer i would absolutely be down to pick it up um but i'm also curious how did that first conversation so you get you have the product you know you went through figuring out how you want it to be delivered um via the beer how did getting that first uh like business to carry your products how did that conversation look like what was the first business that we got gosh it's been a while now um basically okay our first business i think they picked this up was a liquor store in charleston south carolina and that was solely because the guy that was the manager got you know he just you know you know there's just people that you know he didn't look at it be like oh cbd that's pot you know right that's you know why would you sell that you know terrible person right uh this guy you know he just saw it and understood it immediately and you know when and we get people like you know if we get guys that are you know anywhere between my age to like somewhere like in their mid-30s um they typically you know you got a better shot of them just getting it right away and once they get it once again that it's not a health product it's something that's meant to have kind of fun and they can see that it's it's really easy to explain it to them you know it's just a matter of their demographic you know who they've got coming in do they have you know old conservative folk coming to their liquor store do they have like hip youngsters that like you know right you know hemp shots in their beer right so yeah but you know that was that first kind of conversation you know as times have been going on um i've learned to make it simpler to explain you know we used to have three strengths we now just have one because trying to explain three strengths to you know not only to a business owner was there but trying to explain three you know when a customer is standing at a at a bar in a tap room and then you gotta be like what's the difference between the 30 and the 60 and that you know it's like you know you might as well like read a manual about it right so you guys only have the 100 milligram now yeah that's it yeah yeah so that you know and and you know that sold 95 percent i mean 95 of our online sales after um doing like an intro pack where people can kind of try them or then we're just the hundreds so we just decided you know this is what this is a win this is the winner people like it um might as well do it and you know what's even better is then we're able to pass the state you know that's two less uh skus that we have to manage and take care of so we were able to lower our prices uh which is pretty sweet oh man that is awesome so that was the first business that liquor store what was the first brewery that you guys uh slid your products into for insight brewing in minneapolis minnesota so just down the road here yeah yep um and it's done pretty well we've got another one in town here that called dual citizen brewing company that is selling this stuff like that this is what you know it's it's just a great partnership um insight's doing really well with it too but dual citizen especially you know they just got right that perfect demographic to uh you know really make this shine right which is pretty cool yeah that is freaking awesome so you have two main um revenue segments so you have your b2b and your b2c your business of business which you know the liquor stores are good their breweries and then your b2c you know all you the folks are out there jumping online ordering from you guys um for your b to b if i'm a brewery owner i'm watching this episode the daily sip right now uh what would you say to me and then how do i you know how do i reach out to you to get that carry to my brewery oh man i mean like what would i say to you as an owner yeah as a brewery owner like yeah i would say like hey you know this is this is a unique opportunity you know for a new age of drinking you know eventually i really think that you know the next three to four years the fda is going to get you know their act together and you know cbd beer is going to be able to be brewed you know right now this is a workaround and when that happens cbrd is not going to probably exist anymore if people are just going to make cbd beer i get it you know i understand that the writing's on the wall when that happens potentially well it would probably be more of a b2c play at that point you know absolutely yeah well and this still makes it you know instead of investing all this money and one being you know putting all your eggs in one basket this lets you experiment and see like oh wow everybody really likes my porter with cbd i'm trying maybe all right you're right yeah it can be a test kind of thing right um and then even more so you know with 100 milligrams oh boy if they want to put 100 milligrams of you know going through tap lines you know if they don't do it what does that look like i don't even know maybe it won't be a thing and even if it's legal i feel like there's so much manufacturing work around that no i don't think anyone has infrastructure in place to really do that if they do like five milligrams of cbd a pint or something like that i think it'd be fine but if it's like a hundred you know like what we're doing where it's like actually getting you like a lot of stuff it's gonna be uh it'll it'll require some challenges but you know if somebody really figures it out and can can it and whatever you know they're gonna be they're going to become millionaires just off of that you know it'll be like that g3 to the sweetwater yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and the emperor from uh yeah i'll take the the g13 over the emperor personally for sure yeah but no but when i talk to these you know basically i come to people and say hey look you know this is high margin it's doing well you can make decent money doing this it's unique people like it not everyone's gonna like it but when they do like it they come back and they buy it again it's at a price point that's right um and you know at the end of the day it's really not that big of an event you know it's not like they're buying a hundred thousand dollar kegging system or something you know right or it can't write or buying uh you know having to suddenly ship you know it's not like they're pivoting from tap room sales to distribution and then all of a sudden they're lowering their margins on their beer by a gazillion percent they're going this this amount um and so you know that's sort of the way to go and it's just a matter of if you think you have the customer base that has the interest in that kind of stuff and more likely than not i think people you know realize that the answer is yes they do have that customer base because it's not something that's age specific yes you might see one demographic have a little bit more interest but even the older clientele out there like this type of stuff like they were figuring that out before we were even born like this isn't something new absolutely man yeah so you know and it just and also just depends on the point of view of the owner you know obviously you know i i got really hopping on this in january so you know i had two months to like work my um you know work my butt off trying to get the word you know that basically to kind of get my act together and then code it and so now you know we just have all these people you know and it's getting a little bit better especially around here but you know from april to i don't know july or so you know it's just like all of a sudden you're if 70 of your revenue was your tap room you had all of a sudden open a seat you know had to you had to completely do a new business model and then you know this is an upsell so trying to you know trying to implement something that's made for a tap room when you don't have a tap room it's kind of a natural battle yeah that's a 100 true um but you brought up a good point with covid so how has covid you know affected your industry like what are some of the things that you guys have ran into um i mean the beat i mean the b to b just a big part i mean b to c has probably grown about like a typical like b to c company um a typical cbd company um can grow especially you know we're pretty limited budget so we can't pay a ton of money for advertising and stuff like that but we can pay enough to you know pick up a couple i mean most of us are offering organic growth and people tell each other about it um you know so that's only there's only so much speed that that can can go unless you're like uber or something like that right so um but um on the b2b side you know it's just it's just a slower you know and it's just everybody as a whole is has felt that pain of you know you know we feel it you know the malt distributors feel it the this person feel it and beer is crushing it but there's really crushing it for those that already have their distribution systems that's the key yeah if they were set up to already distribute even self-distribute you know cans and not relying fully off of you know uh like restaurant wholesale or growler fills in the tap rooms i definitely agree with that um have you guys ran into any supply issues or any bottlenecks there uh not so as you know we also do i do a lot of contract manufacturing for other cbd businesses so that's also a second side of like what we do and that's a pretty big portion of what we do actually um we've recently been having problems with the california wildfires where our terpenes you know what terpenes are like but but basically terpenes are are you they get extracted from the marijuana plant so like popular strains are like super lemon haze and blue dream you know there's a gajillion different kinds of um terpenes our chirpy manufact or chirping people are are stuck in the fires so all of a sudden they can't get anything out right and so now we've got all this entrant you know we've got some interest when people want to reorder their terpenes it's like well you know what do we do um we get all of our hemp from michigan so we're you know michigan's not in the california wildfires fortunately and so um in regards to cbrd supply it's good um you know we have our own issues in regards to getting the product you know every i mean everyone's got their own hiccups and ours is on the um you know what i was telling you earlier on the labeling and the getting the the um just having the capacity in the the hand the people on board that can keep up with the demand on just making the product look nice and getting it out on time but we've pretty much got that figured out so yeah well that especially you know and that that's the perk of growing you know slower once when you get hit with these you have time to pivot react um put a strategy in place rebuild but if you guys are getting you know 100 000 piece orders from multiple places and then you would run into a wall oh man that would just be a nightmare hundred thousand or yeah hundred if i get a hundred thousand piece order that'd be i don't know i'll be i'll be flying you to help me help me buy everybody everyone we know is gonna be we're gonna be it'll be it'll be a big cbrd bottling party in our in our manufacturing facility hey man they'll tease me with a good time we'll make the drive out there i don't know if you're gonna like yeah well a lot of fun there yeah um but you know we're up to the task uh we just hired one we just hired a full-time bottler we already have a manufacturing team for other stuff and then um so you know some of the other industries that joey's working in um and uh you know it's uh it's growing which is pretty cool but you know these you know brewery owners or liquor store and if they want to get in touch and chat with us they um you know all you have to do is email sales at cbrd.co um you can either talk with me we also have um preston james who is our um if you see him on instagram he's cb cbrd guy but he uh he's our our sa he's been our been a part of this since the beginning is our like main wholesale guy um and he's you know just super helpful and knows he's a marketing whiz and he can help people you know whatever kind of challenges or the way that you want to do this because there's 50 different ways you can market cbrd and attack right you know he's up to the task to really sitting down and you know making sure this is going to be a smash hit wherever you're at so and then you know i'm a part of that too um but he uh he really handles that while i'm doing all kinds of marketing and all kinds of crazy stuff wearing all the different hats we definitely know that whole song and dance and just trying to you know not allow anything to fall through the cracks because you're doing 15 different jobs at once until you could afford to actually hire you know folks to kind of uh build that safety net out um but so my next question i had for you josh uh maybe a little crayola style as my drill sergeant always told me um back in the day when i was in the military uh so breaking it down real easy so there might be some folks out there that are tuning in because uh number one thank you guys for watching go grab a beer i know you need a refill uh so folks out there that are watching they may not know the difference okay so what is cbd versus hem like what is going on here are you able to break that down a little bit yeah so basically hemp is a different you know it's different than marijuana right so when you you know hemp you can sort of call it like hemp and cbd similar um you know especially like after the extraction process you have cbd distill it right or you can buy hemp flour which is not um which hasn't been extracted right so you're buying hemp flour cbd flour you can use them really interchangeably um you know the difference between hemp and say marijuana is marijuana has a ton of thc you know it has most of the number one cannabinoids so you know cbd products have cannabinoids in it and in the marijuana plant the two biggest ones are thc and cbd and so then there's a bunch of other ones cbg is the new kind of like the buzz issue it's the new it's the new popular thing um it's the it's the new buzzword around that and uh something called delta eight thc and that is a whole nother ball that's like if oh gosh if you get in the cbd industry people are buzzing about c about delta athc but but basically essentially you know the cbd itself is has no no thc in it at all but it's one of the um you know one of the many beneficial parts of the hemp plant so when you're buying a cbd product you know there's uh variations how you can buy it this is a full spectrum cbd product so that means that the hemp plants got you know this is hemp derived and it's got that less than 0.3 thc right plus the full spectrum of other cannabinoids a little bit there but it's probably predominantly cbd you can also go somewhere and buy isolate cbd which is absolutely no thc at all but the problem with that is you don't feel it at all you know if you take it you're going to be like gosh this is like snake oil you know it's got similar kind of things and if you're doing like thera you know people use it for like therapy and you just kind of gotta like all right trust me buddy this is but it's not like taking like tylenol or you have that like you know instant like oh this is done right yeah um and you know full spectrum cbd has that similar effect you've got that relaxation um if we made this isolate with no cbd you would take it and not feel anything and say this sucks never buy it again so damn you drop like some alien technology like in the middle of that well when you were talking about some of the other buzzwords and uh cbd those were just brand new words to me i have no idea what that stuff is and they're kind of new to me too i mean i mean i know what they are um i'm not the you know because i focus so much on cbrd you know i'm just i'm sitting around thinking about beer all day all right think about beer people but you know other people in the industry you know they're trying to push wellness products and so they're sitting around thinking you know what's the new trend in wellness what's the new trend in wellness and you know we intend you know a big reason why we say you know cbrd is a good idea is so that we do not have to do that so that we can talk about things that we like talking about which is beer and brewing and cocktails right that's what i like talking about hell yeah which is why you're on the daily sip exactly yeah uh so one of my other questions that we got from some folks out there is how tough is it to start a business in the cbd industry um the startup costs aren't terrible compared to the average business um the cost to push to to grow your business is very hard um you know it's just so you know it's ultra competitive man it's crazy um you got to create niche things kind of like what i've created right you got to create something for a certain industry um you know i've got people that i talk with that you know we do manufacturing for and i help them with their marketing you know i say well you started a cbd business what do you want to start it for they're like back pain i say you're gonna fail all right so let's get a little more niche yeah let's get a little more niche than that right right and then we'll say all right well what do you like doing it's like surfing okay so let's create a product that helps surfers with their back pain and then when you make your marketing you know you can put up a poster that shows a picture of a guy riding a surfboard and shows your product and says like you know write it right right in the sun longer with blah blah blah blah blah right right and so um you know that's if you can figure out who your target customer is and who you want to market to that is you know that's the way you can make it kind of work and then instead of going and hitting up the cbd shop who gets called a hundred gajillion times a day i really like the word i don't know i just think it's a funny number to say gajillion but uh you know they get they literally get cost 200 times a day and we get them too and we don't even have a storefront right saying hey buddy do you want to buy my cbd balm right it's like well you know i'll put you in the list with the other 700 that you know then it's an seo business just to prove your legitimacy but when you're at like a uh um you know if you're but but then if you're going and hitting up bob's surf shop and saying hey bob here's your here's this bomb that'll help your surfers that come into your store and make them feel better then that guys can be like well you're the first person to ever come in here and talk about this damn i'll take i'll take ten right so these are big facts that you're dropping right now like and that it you know it kind of rung true through different you know cohorts and and you know different accelerator classes that we've done to grow our business is that niche down two levels and then they talk about it and it was just super cool like hearing you put it in a real world practical um experience you know because i'm sure you've had that conversation or similar conversations many times uh with different um clients that you may have had before oh yeah i just sit around and think about it you know and i'm sitting around thinking about it all day it's like how do you know you just got to make yourself stand out you know cbrd is the only game in town that's doing this i don't think that's going to last forever no i think we're going to get we're defining gonna yeah we're gonna get ripped off at some point um we'll see how they do that but uh you know if anything that'll be better because then more people you know you know one of the biggest issues we have is they're just like a hemp shot what's a hemp shot right so if we got 100 people you know if all of a sudden everybody knows what a hemp shot is and cbd is the leader in the industry it's a lot better when another sales guy is hitting you up and it's like oh hip shot and then you google you know and then you understand what it is so right absolutely yeah now it you you raise a definitely a few good points um one being you know when we a couple years ago whenever we uh you know brought our different legal team on board just trying to figure out you know how do we protect our brand because you know we're not necessarily creating things we're curating an experience with companies like yours being in our brew box a a company can come in that has a gajillion more times revenue than we do right you know and then what's going to prevent them from uh you know overnight replacing what we do as a company and they basically said dennis what your your intellectual property what you do as a company um that they can't replicate no matter how much money they have or the relationships that you build with folks like yourself josh like things like that so i i definitely agree and i i want to you know end this episode on a light fun note uh so with that said josh what was your first craft beer and you don't have to say how old you were probably like 15 or so gosh man i don't know i don't remember like like like something we're talking about i mean if we're talking about like you know still an independent craft brewery or what got you into craft beer what was the first beer you had you was like what what is this craft beer this is insane i mean i guess it was i mean if we're going craft kik is yingling still consider craft beer i think they change that definition every year as england grows i don't know i mean england was definitely you know yingling was a popular uh beer in college um the i mean since then oh gosh what was my first i used to get so i went to college in south at university of south carolina um i remember the first brewery i really got into was um well i mean i would get some like boston beer company stuff but like like local like you know like something that's not big a big dog right um company was westbrook uh you know they do the mexican cake that oh yeah do with it they do beer infusions too you know them and um evil twin do the mexican the something mexican cake i don't know i used to be able to get in dc which is pretty cool um but they i used to get their gozo it was like it came it got started right when i turned 21. and so i remember buying that and it was just like how on earth does somebody make a beer taste like this like where on earth is that this is crazy this is insane no that that sounds delicious and uh you're definitely making me more and more thirsty what is like what's your favorite craft beer it's probably right now you know it changes for people so i would say my the the beer that i've had and it's tough right like being in the position that that i am where a lot of these breweries and brewery owners have become you know family members of ours you know over the years it's tough to choose between them but you know everyone has a favorite kid right uh so i would say the beer that i'm really digging right now is the le noche triste from which is a stout from butler brew works okay in butler pennsylvania yeah travis is my boy they do a good job a lot of breweries around you know pittsburgh they do a phenomenal job but he's the one that consistently like sticks in the back of my mind um at one point we were popping open you know his brews on multiple episodes of the daily sip and my wife was like stop this we can't just be like a butler brew works uh video series i'm like okay you're right we'll stop i'll drink that when i turn the camera off like a big marketing company for him yeah hey fun he probably loves it so yeah no he's a phenomenal guy and we have so many like breweries around where we are that have just become like family members again to the point where like sometimes i allow relationships to kind of blind optics if that makes sense so for example you know we have the same five ten breweries that we love putting collaborations together doing things with episodes video content going just going there experiencing the brewery my wife sammy basically said we have to make it out we have to keep you know showing that love to everyone i'm like you're right that's why you're here you know yeah man

"[Music] hey guys welcome back this tutorial is all about meringue i get loads of questions about meringue i also get loads of you sending me your pictures of your meringue kisses from my tutorial that i uploaded a few years ago however i still get questions about this wonderful stuff and how to shape it and how to create different things using the same product so this tutorial is all about how to use meringue in different ways so when it comes to different shapes and different decorations i love using swiss meringue so i go on and on about how many different types of meringues there are swiss meringue is firstly what i make before i turn it into swiss meringue buttercream hence the name there's also french meringue which gives a more crumblier meringue and also an italian meringue which is when you make a sugar syrup and pour it into the whisking egg whites and therefore cooks it that's more to decorate like lemon meringue pies with for example and then you blow torch it which is also delicious but when you want to create something a little more structural such as a meringue nest or a meringue lollipop which is what i'm going to show you today it's best to use this swiss meringue and it is so easy to make you just need to know a few things so as usual i have egg white and sugar so for the purpose of today i didn't actually weigh out a specific amount of egg whites i just cracked four large eggs and it gave me 150 grams just by chance and then i weighed out double the amount of sugar so this recipe works with any amount of meringue whether it's 100 grams of egg white and 200 grams of sugar or 300 grams of egg white 600 grams of sugar as long as it's double sugar to egg white it will work the only thing you have to take care of is not to over fill your bowl so if you're using a regular sand mixer i would say maximum 250 egg white and 500 sugar because otherwise you won't incorporate enough air because the bowl is too full but before i go in with the egg whites and sugar i'm just going to talk about what else you need to create some specific meringue decorations so i've got some colors here gel colors as usual i've also got a paint brush because on one of them i'm going to paint the inside of the bag with some water just to clean my paint brush with i've got a couple of piping nozzles so i have a wilton 1m and a pme13 my two favorite piping tips now i've also got a thermometer i like using my infrared thermometer the thing is you don't really have to get it up to a specific temperature because you are cooking it off in the oven but it helps i've also got some paper straws here now you can get lollipop sticks but paper straws are a lot easier to find especially nowadays because we're replacing all the plastic and they work just the same and also you can get pretty colors of them and then i've got two trays one with a non-stick mat and one with some paper the meringues work the same on both but i'm just going to show you the difference anyway i've also got a pan of simmering water to the side for when i cook the meringue but first i'm going to show you how to prepare the piping bag and like with the kisses i'm going to turn the piping bag inside out now what's important is you actually want to turn it out as much as possible without losing that triangle so you can bring it back through so i actually put my finger in the bottom and move the end of the piping bag upwards as much as possible so actually the hole at the end is as big as my finger that's a good indication of when it's small enough and i've got a jar here which i'm just going to rest the piping bag on so i can free up my hands so i'm going to show you how to pipe rainbow swell lollipops first of all so i've got a rainbow selection of colors from blue to yellow to pink and purple and green and i'm going to paint stripes down the piping bag so the first thing to remember it's important to paint the very top end of the piping bag not down here if it doesn't touch where the piping bag bends in it's not going to come out on the meringue so that's super important so i've got the blue here and i'm going to paint from the top about halfway down just one line now i'm not sure if you can see but it looks like the color disappears but that's just because of the reaction of the color on the plastic don't worry the color is very much on there and it will come out really nicely so next to the blue i'm gonna go on with my next color i like leaving a gap of white so you can see when you pipe um some white as well it looks really nice against the colors and again another line now the lines don't have to be perfect it's not too obvious when you pipe out your meringue next i'll do the yellow then the green and finally the purple so i've got five lines of color i didn't actually space them so evenly but it doesn't matter too much i can now lift off the piping bag put my hands inside and grab that triangle if you're having trouble grabbing it you can always put the end of your paintbrush in the piping bag and push it towards your hands and this is the moment where everyone gets scared because they think they're going to ruin the lines don't worry you're not going to you could just pull it back through and then i like to put it into the jar so it's ready to fill once the meringue is made with the other two piping bags i'm just going to apply the tips in now some people ask me if you could do the stripes with a tip i actually find with a piping tip it kind of stops the color from coming in i've done it before where i've actually painted the inside of the tip as well but i think it's a little bit more fiddly so i'd rather paint a piping bag without a tip and then color meringue if i want to get some colored meringue with specific shapes so now i'm ready to make my meringue you can of course prepare your piping bags while the egg white and sugar is heating up but i just wanted to show you rather than being over the heat and doing it at the same time also it's important to watch over the egg white and sugar just in case it catches so egg whites straight into my mixer bowl along with my sugar and i'm going to give it a good mix with my spatula so i don't want to see any lumps of egg whites still in there so once your sugar and egg white is fully incorporated this can now go onto a pan of simmering water now if i were to just leave this and walk away what will happen is that the steam will only cook the underneath and leave the rest of the egg white and sugar and then you can get scrambled egg white which you don't want you want a nice glossy even meringue so i'm going to stand over it keep mixing it and keep scraping the sides down and what you're looking for is for all the sugar to dissolve in the egg white so what i'm doing as i'm heating it up i'm constantly scraping those sugary bits down the side of the bowl back into the egg white mixture because i don't want those sugar crystals to remain crystals i want them all melted in to the egg white and every now and then i'm going to read the temperature of it what you can also do is just put your finger in and then feel it between your fingers and see if you can feel any sugar crystals so i can feel it's quite warm don't worry it's not hot enough that it will burn you it's just a little bit sticky i can't feel any sugar crystals anymore which means it's ready so now it's come up to temperature i'm just going to do one last scrape around with my spatula just to make sure that all of that sugar is in the egg white and then put it on my stand mixer with a whisk attachment at one speed below full i found that this is the best way to incorporate the air and you want to leave it to whisk for about five minutes until it's trickled in size and really nice and firm so as you can see it's ready when it holds itself and it's at a stiff peak so the bowl can be slightly still warm if you're making a really large amount you may be whisking it for a very long time and the bowl's still warm but it has considerably cooled down to when it was heating up but this is the stage you want if it's too loose you want to whisk it more there is a chance that you didn't heat it up enough so you might just have to start again because it's this is what you want so before i fill my piping bag i'm just going to give it one stir with my spatula and now i can fill the piping bag and now i'm going to cut the very end of it so about two centimeters from the bottom so it is smaller than the size you would cut for meringue kisses and before i pipe i'm going to put it onto the surface and almost push the meringue and stroke it through so this gets rid of some of the air bubbles but it also ensures that the color is on the meringue and it will definitely come out when you pipe so that's one piping bag ready so i've got my piping bag with my 1m nozzle and i'm going to leave the meringue whites for this i'm going to create some meringue nests which are a really nice dessert especially if you want to make individual portions and then i'm going to color the remaining so i'm just going to go in with a couple of drops of gel food coloring naturally using pink and mix that in so i've got my three different piping bags ready to pipe like i said i have a tray with a non-stick mat on and i've also got a tray with some baking paper so if you're using paper because the meringue is very light it might fly away in the oven so it's important to stick this down which you can do by blobbing some meringue underneath the paper and just sticking it to it or if you have some little magnets like i do which everyone gets extremely jealous of but they are just regular small magnets you can stick the paper to the tree so the oven is set to 100 degrees celsius it's very low because essentially you're just drying out the meringue rather than cooking it so if your meringues are browning slightly it means your temperature is too high also if you want to do some different shapes of meringue put the larger ones on one tray and the slightly smaller ones on another because the smaller ones will obviously be ready before the larger ones will be so now let's get piping so i'm going to start with the rainbow lollipops so i've got my piping bag that i painted the color inside now obviously for lollipops you need a stick so the first thing you want to do is pipe on a few blobs of meringue i like to do it in alternate spaces because i know that the lollipops will take up space when i pipe them now these blobs of meringue is what the lollipop stick sticks to and now i'm going to pipe in a spiral shape so i start in the center and keep the pressure even as i do a tight spiral and you can see that the colors come out naturally and then when i want to stop i stop pressing but continue in the same direction so it finishes off quite flat rather than have a peek now i like to pipe lollipops in different sizes because when i put them on top of a cake it's nice to have a variation of sizes it just adds to the design so i've got a couple of large ones and i'll do some small ones and that is how you pipe the meringue lollipops now i usually have some leftover meringue when i do lollipops and it will be a shame for it to go to waste so i'm going to make some kisses and i can use the same piping bag by snipping off the end so i make a larger hole some meringue might fall out but that's not a problem just make sure you take the plastic away and then like normal i can pipe my kisses so start not too far from the tray and not too close press and lift up i actually got a little air bubble there so with one piping bag you've managed to create two completely different decorations which look amazing on top of the cake and you can of course color it however you like i just love the rainbow effect and there is my rainbow meringue lollipops and kisses so this time i'm going to make lollipops using the 1m nozzle so i'm going to start the same way just by piping some meringue onto the tray and you can obviously see that the piping nozzle gives it a nice shape once again stick the straws to that blob of meringue so technology got the better of me and it stopped recording as i was piping my lollipops but the action is exactly the same as it was for the rainbow lollipops and now i'm going to show you how to pipe the meringue nests so i'm going to go around in a similar action as i did with the lollipops but this time i'm going to continue piping and go on top of what i already piped around the outside and create sort of walls to the meringue and leave a hole in the middle and once they're cooked it's a great dessert to fill with cream and top with fruits like this and then finally i've got my smaller star tip so this is the pme 13 and i'm basically just gonna show you how many different decorations you can make with the same piping tip so firstly i'm going to start off with simple stars so the same action as i would do for kisses but you can see how different they look because of the piping tip and these look really cute on top of cakes maybe even on top of cupcakes because they're quite small now if you want a theme a cake or cupcake with something specific for example christmas is coming up you can do a double squeeze or even triple and make almost little christmas trees i've obviously got pink here but you can do this in green and create the same effect so they look really cute you can of course make lollipops with this nozzle however because it's quite a small one i prefer doing specific shapes with it so just to show you as an example i'll do the letter k rather than just piping straight down like this i'm going to do a rope so i'm going to pipe in a spiral shape over the lollipop it's called a rope technique and it's a great way to get a solid line and to make the k i'll do the same motion to create the two lines on the side of the letter you can of course do some other designs such as hearts or you can get creative and do all sorts of different piping to create a really fun looking lollipop the best thing with this meringue it holds its shape in the oven so the possibilities are endless so i might do a few more hearts so you're just pushing the meringue out in one direction and then piping some more close to it in a slight diagonal and there you get a heart so as you can see three trays each of completely different designs all made from the same meringue and they're going to look awesome on their own on top of a cake whatever you do with them and of course tastes delicious too so when it comes to cooking the meringues like i said the oven needs to be at 100 degrees celsius and you want to keep them in for about an hour for smaller meringues such as the small pink ones i piped they will probably be ready in about 40 minutes but you can't really overcook meringue in fact i once forgot about my meringues in the oven i was busy doing other things i think they ended up staying in there for like three hours and they were fine if anything they were really good so at least an hour but for larger ones such as the pavlova nests maybe an hour and a half and they'll be ready when they're completely hardened and you can just take them off the tray and they're not sticky at all so meringue is cooked so what i ended up doing is leaving it in the oven for an hour and a half and i felt that the meringues were cooked enough and i could literally take one off and it holds itself so that is what you're looking for when it comes to meringue so what i'm going to do is just show you the difference of how it comes off paper and how it comes off the mat to be honest there's not so much of a difference but with a mat you tend to get a cleaner base of your meringues so even with the lollipops they can just come off the tray and you get this almost like shiny back to it so they do come off a lot easier on a mat so if you do have one it's great to use one it also saves paper but the baking paper works just the same it just might be a little bit stickier so for example with this k lollipop when the more delicate shapes you have to take them off more carefully i like to peel the paper off and there you have it so i've obviously made a ton of meringue and i'm just going to show you a nice little trick um to display the lollipops so either you can stick them directly into a cake for example so you can insert this directly into a cake however if you're doing like a dessert table for example or you just want table decorations and you've made some meringue lollipops what i like to do someone showed me this is to get jars and fill them with sprinkles but the sprinkles not only add to the look but they're sturdy enough so when you put the lollipop in it doesn't move so this is a really cute trick and it looks really nice when you have a few lollipops in there all at different heights so this little heart one came out really nicely as well just like that they're really nice table decorations and obviously you can theme them and then the others just simply come off the mats and paper and if you've watched my other youtube tutorials you'll see that most my cakes end up having kisses on simply because you're halfway through making swiss meringue buttercream when you make swiss meringue so i like to do at the same time so you can see there are endless possibilities with meringue try it out try different shapes different colors even different piping tips let me know how you get on and of course if you do try them out remember to tag me at george's cakes on instagram in the meantime if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel like this video and we'll see you next time [Music] you",

"wtzEEOxSFPg": "[Music] [Music] hey everybody welcome back it's John with AZ holistic and the CBT studio and dispensary it is Wednesday night and we're gonna do another streaming episode for you hope you enjoy last week we went into detail or our two weeks ago went into detail on CBD for sleep how the hormone melatonin works in the body as well as some detail on sleep cycles so check it out if you haven't already done so now this week we're gonna go over inhalation of cannabinoids pretty busy topic right now we're getting a lot of hits on the website people are constantly searching for different vape products so we're gonna show you some screenshots of the biology of inhalation and why when you inhale this molecule that's absorbed by the lungs very rapidly and enters the brain we're gonna show you how that happens then we're gonna go into detail on several products and how they operate now our clients are always asking about drug interactions so let's begin there the way that cannabinoids are administered has a major impact on negative drug interactions now we're learning more about this as time goes on so we want to try to share this with you as we learn it contraindications as they're referred to are more likely when both products the drug and CBD or cannabinoids are taken orally and processed by the liver before being distributed through the body now we've been telling people that if you are on a prescription medication of any kind definitely leave at least two hour window between the time that you take your medication and the time that you consume your can or your CBD in this case so two hours at least and cannabinoids are absorbed more now this is new science we just got some information we researched this past week apparently cannabinoids are more absorbed if ingested on a full stomach typically in the store we've been telling people it doesn't really matter if it's a fuller empty stomach it's still gonna be absorbed but some new science some new data is recently come out to suggest that ingesting cannabinoids will have a higher peak liver concentration than inhaled cannabinoids so this makes sense because obviously it's going through the liver and when we inhale we're bypassing that blood-brain barrier okay so ingested cannabinoids may have more of a potent drug interaction now we've seen very few contraindications in the last three years of selling CBD but for this reason some people opt to inhale their CBD versus ingest it and so that's the topic for tonight so let's get into that real quick here so just as with nicotine products okay the ingredients or the materials that you're inhaling need to be pure and free from contaminants now the vape industry has been promoting nicotine vape products since 2009 or so and finally the long-term studies are beginning to make headlines there was a few studies that have come out recently talking about how dangerous vaping is now chemicals obviously are not healthy to inhale period but many of these liquid vapor products containing a variety of different chemicals and some of them are relatively dangerous but now there's some other popular vape products that are 100% organic like a company that I used to recommend called vape organics very popular company out of California and their nicotine products are a 100% organic personally I think the danger is with the the chemicals obviously and the users of these products are pulling on these devices so much that they're literally overloading their lungs with vapor and even vegetable glycerin which is a natural product gets real sticky in the lungs when vaporized and just can clog up the lung so a lot of us have seen people with these big mods or larger than this and they're just pulling on them and blowing offs of clouds and I just I think most of us realize that's probably not very good for you so ultimately let's get back to CBD and show you biologically how the molecule works from an inhalation perspective so the first thing we want to talk about is the atomizer Lonnie if you would please put the picture of the atomizer up there so very common vape device little battery okay because you need three things to vaporize a liquid remember there's no decarboxylation going on here there's no burning there's no flame of any kind this is a liquid that is contained in a little cartridge and inside the atomizer Lonnie just put a picture of an atomizer up there is a tiny little coil in there and then with the battery when you press the button the battery will send energy to the coil and with oxygen it will vaporize the liquid so we're taking a liquid that we otherwise would put on our body and we're vaporizing it so we can get it into the lungs where it can be absorbed very rapidly okay so three things are necessary power from the battery the liquid of course and oxygen from our breath so that's how we nebulize or vaporize now I'm gonna have Lonnie put up another image and this we're gonna take a second just to describe when we inhale CBD and it's absorbed from the lungs very rapidly into the brain we want to show you how it gets there and in the detail of today's video down below in the detail section you're gonna find a link to a really good video that was done by a college student who is getting her master's and she put together a diagram of exactly the visual of how your body absorbs cannabinoids it's really good so check that out but in any event here's a picture of the brain and we're looking at different sections of the brain and what we're doing is we're disappearing Lonnie and go to section 2 we're kind of disappearing part of the brain till we get down to the medulla here and now we're gonna expand on that section which is really important because this is where we get to the periaqueductal gray matter and this is where signals are sent okay from the lungs to the brain okay these little signals and this is what provides the analgesic effect of CBD to help with pain receptors in the brain okay and so obviously when we eat CBD it's gonna be slower we've talked about that a moment ago being digested through the liver and then when we inhale it it's gonna be far more rapid getting to the brain okay so that's kind of how it occurs okay and so what we want to do is when we come back from the break we're gonna show a bunch of different CBD products and vape products I'm gonna show you how they work but remember all cannabinoids you ingest will get into the brain the key is the time it takes to get there also when you eat CBD there's no way for us to ever know in a way for you to know how much of the molecule is actually getting to the brain and that's because it's being absorbed within the liver and there may not be enough CBD to pool up and start providing the influence to the neurotransmitters in the brain okay that means that even though you're taking some CBD you're still deficient there's not enough there to stimulate the receptors in the brain so that's the reason why when people come in the store we always start everyone low to be safe between five and ten milligrams that's typically what we suggest and we'll say if you don't feel any benefits at that dose slowly increase your dose every three to five days until you get to the right dosage it's the same with inhalation you can take one puff and get one milligram into the lungs and into the brain and it may not be quite enough to stimulate those receptors so wait a minute or two take another puff see if you can feel the augmentation of an and amide and see if you can feel that distinct lowering of cortisol in the brain so at any event we're gonna take a short break stick around because we're gonna come back and we're gonna go over several CBD vape products for you and talk about the pros and cons of them okay hopefully that was helpful we'll see you back here shortly welcome to AZ holistic Arizona's CBD source for education guidance and high quality CBD and plant-based products so what is CBD CBD is an acronym CB d stands for cannabidiol and it's naturally occurring cannabinoid that's found in many plant species including cannabis which a lot of people know about it's also found in hemp and a larger dosage there's more CBD and hemp than there is in cannabis so it's a naturally occurring plant molecule that helps to balance the body at AZ holistic we don't just sell CBD we help educate people on how it works in the body our number-one goal here at the store is to educate people to take responsibility for themselves and be able to start eating more healthy and understand different toxins and food our bodies divinely inspired to heal the immune system is always working and when you interrupt that with materials that don't belong in the body you're going to get symptoms so when we put cannabinoids in the body it's going to regulate and balance just about every function of the human body including in the body right the peripheral and the central nervous system our compassionate and knowledgeable staff are dedicated to helping people live happier and healthier while vastly improving their quality of life we've seen a lot of people with different forms of dementia whether it's Parkinson's or Alzheimer's and they come in the store trembling and shaking because that region of the brain is being disrupted and then they get on CBD and within three six eight weeks they come back in and they hold their hand out like this and I'm sorry but we all start crying because it's it's pretty incredibly moving when you see someone's life change you [Music] [Applause] you [Music] hey everybody John here back with AZ holistic gonna finish up the second half of our stream regarding inhalation products and the benefits of inhaling CBD and cannabinoids into the brain alright so prior to the quick break there we talked about a lot of these vapors that are vaping nicotine a lot of these individuals will come into the store and say do you have any CBD from my vape device and we say yes you can buy some CBD typically that's gonna be suspended in a vegetable glycerin because vegetable glycerin is very benign it's natural and you can contain the CBD within the vegetable glycerin no nicotine of course cuz we don't recommend nicotine is a stimulant to the brain so all these people that are vaping nicotine saying it's relaxing me I need to relieve my stress nothing could be further from the truth nicotine is a stimulant to the brain and it really messes up our genes and it's just not healthy we've got some links on the website to talk to you a little bit more detail about that but these mods that are very common nowadays when you put CBD in the mod a lot of people will come in and say I'm not feeling it how come I'm not feeling it I'm taking a thousand milligrams and I'm not feeling it well number one most of these individuals have their wattage set way too high we've been recommending for years that you do not vape your existing mod above 25 watts now a lot of people are pulling on their nicotine at a hundred watts or higher and blowing those big clouds CBD will burn in the coil above 25 watts so I actually suggest 15 to 20 watts it's plenty you're not gonna get as big of a cloud but you're all you're trying to do is vaporize the medicine to get it into your lungs so that it can get to the brain so anyone that's got a mod that's using CBD we do not recognize I'm sorry we do not recommend that you use nicotine with CBD because they're both trying to do different things in the brain for example CBD gets in the lungs hits the neuro receptors in the brain it wants to calm us and relax us if nicotine is mixed in with the CBD we have this battle for supremacy going on we got nicotine trying to get in the brain we got CBD trying to lower increase in and amide and lower cortisol and we get this going on so if you are going to vape CBD in your existing device make sure you have no nicotine and keep your wattage low if your wad is just too high your coils will burn it and you won't actually be in the CBD into your brain you'll just be frying your coil and your coil will clog a lot of people are saying oh yeah my coils going three times faster I didn't know why it's because the heats too high so mods keep the wattage low fill it with a good quality CBD product preferably a vegetable glycerin some people vape MCT oil with their CBD but MCT at a high wattage can also be dangerous to the lung so there's something called lipid pneumonia that can occur in some people if they're vaping an MCT product at too high a wattage so be cognizant of that as well okay so now let's talk about the most common CBD pens disposable pens these things are very simple they're preloaded with CBD some of them have 100 milligrams some will have 250 and literally it's just all self-contained and you just pull on it hold it for three seconds exhale always leave enough extra breath in your lungs so when you pull on it you have enough extra breath to pull in and get it into the lungs if you're pulling on your pen and you're just blowing it out you're not getting the CBD into your lungs therefore you're not getting any benefit you're wasting your money and you're wasting your CBD so make sure you leave room to inhale it nice and deep hold it there for three seconds and then exhale see how you feel after a minute or two if you don't feel any augmentation whatsoever in the head and we talked to people all day long we've been doing this a long time some people say my temples feel pressure other people say the top of my head tingles other people say my neck feels warm or my ears some people literally feel it in their shoulders they just relax there should be some type of augmentation some type of a thing you can put your finger on if you pull on it and you feel nothing wait a few minutes it again tried to determine how many milligrams you need to stimulate the neurotransmitters okay so that's a disposable pen when they're done you throw them away they're simple to use I'm not a fan of putting things in in the trash because we've got a trash issue in America but they're very convenient to use okay so that's a disposable pen distillate this is a new product and this is also a disposable pen we're selling more distillate now than anything so distill it is just CBD extracted in a different way so it holds in the natural terpenes as well as the other cannabinoids when you extract CBD through a co2 process you're stripping away everything except the CBD and CBD is very good for anxiety and pain but when you have a multi spectrum distillate this product has more modulatory benefits so this is a self-contained a pen much like this one we just showed you okay that's the first one we showed you the second one you can actually see the material so you know if you're getting empty okay and same deal three seconds exhale top of my head's tingling that's what happens to me I literally can feel it so disposable pens very convenient we carry these in 250 milligrams 500 milligrams as well as 750 milligrams and our 750 milligram is a little pod it's this little black unit and that's a 1 milliliter 1 gram and that same idea it's a disposable pen you just pull on okay so now we go to very common cartridges ok so again before the break we talked about the battery being the energy source the atomizer is what vaporizes and with oxygen you're gonna vaporize so these devices typically the cartridge is what you're purchasing and the battery is required the battery does repeat arged and these batteries are fickle for some people some new CBD users older people that come in who haven't been vaping at all you want to make sure that you press this button 1 2 3 4 5 in unison to turn it on and 1 2 3 4 5 and unison to turn it off ok some of these batteries have three settings when you turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 turns it on and then to turn it from low you saw the green light 1 2 3 changes it to blue and then 1 2 3 it's gonna change it to red low medium and high heat why do you ask we need to have different settings well for many people who are vaporizing their th see some THC cartridges have what's called live resin in them it's a different type of produced cannabinoid and live resin typically requires a little bit higher heat to nebulize it ok so that's the only reason for that alright so we talked about mods we talked about disposable devices and then we talked about the cartridges that go on the battery that's pretty much it we also have the nasal inhalers which people absolutely love for allergies it's just like a little Vicks inhaler just put it in your nose take a nice pull on it there's really no vapor this is literally just the the CBD is soaked on a little sponge in there and then literally just getting it pulled into the nasal cavity very quick relief for any type of allergy during the allergy seasons so hopefully that helped you guys understand a little bit more about vaping or nebulizing CBD and if you have any questions feel free to comment share it and if you have any specific questions feel free to reach out to us we're happy to answer Lani's giving me a little signal alright so we did have a question from Facebook John determining your dose with CBD oil is really easy you know you have the tincture bottle with the dropper correct how do you determine your dosage with excellent question that's a really good question I'm glad that whoever asked that asked it because it's similar but different okay as I said a few moments ago when you're inhaling your CBD take a pull on it so let's say you have a 250 milligram art regime ups it's gonna be about one milligram per puff now a puff can be two seconds or puffs could be six seconds so obviously you're going to administer more CBD on a six second puff than you are in a three second puff right caution we don't typically recommend people take long drags because that atomizer we talked about will heat up and it'll start to burn your medicine so short three-second puffs take a three second pull on it hold it in exhale give yourself a couple of minutes see if you feel any Agnon tation do you feel any relief do you feel pressure in the temples do you feel anything going on behind the eyes or the ears of the throat I've had people come in the store and try a product a pen pull on it and say I'm getting chills down the back of my neck that's a sign that you're getting a change in your brain so I typically look for the change that's the signal to let you know that you've got cannabinoids up there and they're starting to stimulate the receptors because you can get CBD up there but the goal is to stimulate the receptors so you can get that anxiety adjustment from the five ht1 alpha receptor in the brain that controls serotonin and that's what brings on the anti-anxiety feeling so take a poll give it a minute or two you don't feel anything take another poll if you don't feel it if you have to take five or six pulls on your pen to feel it now you need to bump up to 500 milligrams double the dose then maybe one or two puffs will do it so that's how we typically start people they suggest we start with 250 milligrams and if you need to go up to 500 or 750 you can but again in our store we never upsell we want the people to pay as little as possible to get the most relief so that was a good question thank you for that okay and one more somebody asked one of the devices used had a button on it do all the the inhalers require Church excellent I missed that so thank you for bringing that up excellent so this particular one that has a button on it okay is from candy pen we like candy pen as a brand because they have a bet they have a warranty and that's wonderful I mean most of these things are made in China if not all of them and sometimes you get faulty devices and candy pen stands behind their brand so we like them so many of these batteries do not even have the button they're just a vacuum so you put the cartridge on you don't even have to press a button you literally just and it'll actually ignite or atomized the medicine simply with the vacuum activated so those pens here in our store of 20 bucks and then the buttons with the three settings are 30 so good question thank you for sharing that a lot of people prefer the vacuum activated because they don't have to press any buttons another benefit to the vacuum is if you press this button okay and you're not pulling on it if I just sit here and hold this button down the atomizer will turn on and it'll just fry the CBD will sit there and just fry it and then it'll get real dark and black and become tar and it literally cooks it so a lot of people don't like to mess with the button because they don't want to jack up the atomizer or burn their medicine so vacuum activated seems to be more common for most people for CBD but again if you're doing live resin typically takes a little bit more heat to run that okay so excellent question guys appreciate it so I see you have a ruby pen there are we still carrying that and good question to say so we do have Ruby pens okay these guys have a little pod and the pod has to be filled with a CBD I'm not a fan of it because they're messy you got to take the dropper you got to take the little grommet out you have to take the dropper and put it in there and you typically get a little bit of oil spilling down there and it gets all over your hands and just a little bit of oil Viji it's like it's all over you you can't you don't even know where it's coming from so I'm not a fan of these guys just because of the mess associated but you can buy extra pods and you can have two or three different pods with different flavors in them and you can pop in your vanilla pod for the day and go use your CBD vanilla and then the next day you feel like cinnamon popping your cinnamon pod so there's some benefits to the flexibility of the Rubies also made by candy pen but to me just they're just a little bit messy alright guys thanks so much for joining us any other questions feel free to email us and we look forward to seeing you next month where we're gonna have a really interesting show we're gonna have a special guest and we'll be talking about why you don't want to purchase your CBD in certain places certain places have questionable content we'll see you then [Music] [Music]", "Y1qdJYZFJB0": "with all the weed trucks and imagery all over New York these days you might think to yourself hey is marijuana legal now not quite what these companies are selling is actually something called CBD it's found in everything from lollipops to lattes and business is booming CBD products are part of what is estimated to be a roughly 1 billion dollar industry in the United States and it's perfectly legal so what the CBD have that marijuana doesn't back to the matter is were kind of in the midst of the CBD craze right now Martin Lee is the director of project CBD an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics CB d stands for cannabidiol that's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant therapeutic properties but it's not intoxicating it doesn't get you high like a THC as it happens not all cannabis plants are created equal take a look at these two varieties one is marijuana the other is hemp one gets you high the other doesn't the key difference is what's on the inside THC and CBD are the main components of the character displayed THC is what makes you feel high and marijuana plants are loaded with it hemp on the other hand has hardly any THC at all but what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD now CBD won't get you high but it does have a redeeming quality it's legal and at least according to the marketing it has a relaxing effect so since this stuff is all the rage let's see how it's made so once you have a cannabis plant one simple way to make extract can be done in your own kitchen as simple as using olive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant a little bit of the green material from the plant obviously that's not very useful for a mass industrial production to to be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis but the more common way involves a specialized complex a machine one very widespread way is using what's called a supercritical co2 extraction it's ground up to be to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind and it's it's poured into vessels literally of a supercritical co2 machine it will stay in that machine for upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of the extraction process and ultimately you'll end up with a thick golden oil that's very waxy and texture you can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons you can find this oil in a number of different products these days it can be administered in various different forms it might be ingested it might be applied topically they even have CBD oil products for your pets I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts of CBD infused products I tried a CBD matcha latte and a CBD macaron these snacks tasted great and I felt a little more relaxed after but it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head scientists are actually still trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body so there really is a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work but we're still really a long way of mastering the house still CBD may have more benefits than just the relaxing afternoon some initial studies have shown that CBD can help with a number of different medical conditions in fact in June 2018 the FDA approved the first CBD drug epidemics which is used to treat epilepsy so who knows perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis decorated vans in the future [Music] you [Music]", "NsH5b3BOFMk": "[Music] good morning YouTube how we doing this morning stay three Kido I'm still trying to wake up prior just getting started here we're trying to get one of my videos up on YouTube my computer is dragon but this morning I've got my turbo coffee here and breakfast is leftovers from yesterday morning that taco meat eggs cheese hell opinions and some avocado and it is delicious we break through my fast and getting fueled up for the day how long do you're driving ahead of me it's Monday oh boy now whoever had this bright idea that YouTube is simple it's not i'm italian man so that were you thinking YouTube is monster so let me sit here in a quarter video and put it up that's not all it's about that's like the smallest little details Louis minutia that is recording a video after you record the video that's when the fun really starts you have to do all the editing and the cutting and getting rid of all the others and the random rambling moves and cut it down to you a decent sized video that people will actually want to watch it's not easy musings for today I think I'm not going to take as much for me for lunch as I did Saturday because I didn't really need it I just I think lunch on it because it was there our day one picture is going to be very minimal because an get picture while I was filming too early for me to come up with something clever hopefully the fact that it's day one just draws people's attention all right so we're getting started here just getting out the door I'm about ten minutes later than I like to be usually but it is like this thankfully I work my hours so I can be as late as I want to be today I am not bringing all the snackies because I felt like Saturday I was just going to eating because I had them and because I felt like I should or I wanted to I don't know so today I just brought my egg cups for lunch and I brought a smoothie so I kind of leave off hunger through the morning and of course bottle of water just regular plain old h2o and in order to fight the cravings of munchies I got some gum so I don't know if what is a sweetness with xylitol right I'm not sure is alcohol is bad on the diet or what I figure it's sugar-free though and as opposed to putting a bunch of unnecessary calories in I'm going to be good to keep off the munchies so when you roll in here and I'll catch up with y'all later back sitting in traffic much fun on the way to Boston and I'm just realizing that I probably need to get a couple of new sweaters because these videos will be very important going to look like I'm wearing the same thing every day because I do wear my same sweater because it's cozy every day I need to get some different colors I need to get some more sweatshirts although it's getting to be summertime so they'll be going away soon sadly I like my sweatshirt it's like my purse I put everything in my pockets instead of having to carry a purse so first world problems right and in how sitting in traffic waitin for a ride to come in heading towards bus and hopefully I can get somebody heading towards the airport or something I'm about 30 miles away from there so that would be a good ride to start off my Monday morning so fingers crossed all right so I did get my right into the airport today and now I'm going to work my way out but it doesn't look like there's a big queue at the airport for ride so hopefully I'll get a quick ride out of here finally awake my energy level has picked up a little bit so that's a good thing and not hungry I did drink my shake and I'm working on searching water now think so far about this time I would be feeling hungry with what I've had so far feel like it should hold me through until lunchtime alright guys so I am just head home it's about 1:00 in the afternoon um I had my eggs I wasn't really super hungry but I just felt like I should eat something before my blood sugar went completely low I feel I will work in the garden I just stopped at the store to get a couple more things for the garden I got a couple of trellises so I'm going to do that and hopefully get all my seeds sown for today and get the garden all set up and hopefully everything start growing love-letters want to make a notes if anybody is interested in driving for uber I will put my referral code down below I also have a list referral code that you can use if you're interested I do this full time this is how I support myself and my daughter I do not have another job so just throwing that out there you can use that to sign up and it will get a bonus for you and a bonus for me I am going to lie I could use the bonuses so if anybody wants to utilize that you're welcome to do so so I am just spent home I'm up to ten minutes away and I'm gonna work on my card and I'll get back to that when I love that so now I am going to head inside and work on editing video for day number two and hopefully get that posted tonight or worst case scenario first thing tomorrow morning and get all this video in try to get it edited and this will full-time job guys alright don't get too excited this isn't a peel-off mask this is just a wash off final wrap-up for tonight I'm definitely feeling more energetic I did not get a nap in today and not really missing it I did do feel a lot I was a lot more productive today one of the things that I've been seeing lately is the talk about like when you first start losing weight on keto it's mostly why our weight and not going to lie I'm kind of hoping that it comes off my legs first because the swelling that I get on a daily basis I would definitely like it to go away it's painful and it's irritating I can't wear all the cute socks that I have that I love without them practically cutting off my circulation those are my final thoughts for day 3 on keto all right so it's day 4 and according to your analysis strips my body is producing low to moderate amounts of ketones so I think that's a good thing all right so we are at 326 like we're down about 1.2 pounds in 3 days all right so I'm on a little bit late this morning but I got my coffee it seems to be trying lately man late husband got my coffee and wait in the way and totally won't be as frequent I'm going to do way ends at the end of the week but I kind of wanted to see where I was at so far after a few days because I'm you know how are those mental things like I feel like oh my god I'm putting all this fat and all these calories into my body I'm going to bloat up even bigger than I am now and I just wanted to check and make sure that I was on the right path if that makes sense I don't know maybe it's just me maybe I'm just mental so I had to weigh in just to see make sure I hadn't already gained 5 pounds in 3 days so lost a pound point to not bad I mean better than I've been doing the last four months at like a pound a month so we'll keep going and I will weigh in again on Saturday [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] deep within at the gym headed home runnin low on energy and I'm kind of bummed out because I tripped going up the stairs this morning and busted my knee and so I could only work arms today and I had intended on doing my cardio as well just to see what my endurance is right now with the keto fuel and to see if my body was actually starting to burn through the ketone I'm going to do a little more research on ketones tonight and how that whole process works because I know the gist of it but I'd like to know the specific scientific of it as well yeah so far energy levels okay I mean I kind of feel like I could lie down take a little nap but it is also lunchtime well afternoon snack time I had my egg cups for lunch and I feel like I need something else I'm actually a little bit hungry you know I probably just I will probably just go home and make a turbo coffee because I've got some more editing to do I said I figure out what I'm doing for dinner tonight I have no idea but I will check back later after dinner all right guys so I got my coffee I know I said I get back to school later but because I was kind of in the mood for something something look at these smoked sardines in olive oil a try like I said I don't believe I've ever had sardines so this should be interesting I've had full plans I like smoked plans and oh gosh they look disgusting okay I'm I'm a little concerned about this one bring out some of the oil here just you can see what I'm looking at that is what it looks like it's multi bad smells like smoked fish in olive oil and I imagine how they're really soft okay so I imagine you just eat the whole thing like you don't need to do you need to do moment or anything pick this apart for a minute and see what I got is what we're looking at we've got any bitty little bones I kind of just want to like take the little spines out because texture like anything I don't like it's a texture thing and I would be the one that would get all the itty bitty little bones stuck in my throat just because not bad you know what tastes a lot better than it looks so I'm just gonna have one fish this cuz I just wanted I just wanted to try it I think I just swallowed a piece of bone better afin okay so hmm fish skin I'm stuck on the top of your mouth that's the most pleasant texture okay well I'm going to stick with my coffee into this afternoon I'll save those for another time because I made my coffee over yourself I have got recipes to print out that my aunt sent me there print out the recipes to make lists to go grocery shopping tomorrow then I got to go do laundry I need to take a shower but I got no more clean towel so it's time to do laundry so I'm going to do the recipe thing real quick first then we'll do laundry then I got to go pick a big girl from her after-school program and then dinner and I think I'm going to do chicken and sweet potatoes tonight wolfy morning just going to get a bigger lunch here for school two more boiled eggs a little baggy in that and some string cheese and some water and then you hear another string cheese and nuts for in case you can write after school leaflet launches upload those Clips you can have accessible fat got my coffee most important meal of the day some egg cups for me for lunch and yeah I get to do grocery shopping today and pick up some alternative I'm excited I've got a whole bunch of new recipes for my hand I got a printout bacon ease recipe we can do some meat cheese and lettuce roll-ups with some bacon Hayes for lunch which will be exciting cuz it'll be something different so I'll get back with you later hey fry J fry then I'm also going on time yeah all right so I'm actually feeling a lot more energized this morning then I have the last few days so that is a good thing the plan of course because things didn't work out the way I planned them last night I did not give a chance to make my list so hopefully I get someone into the airport this morning and then while I am there waiting for a ride I can make my list and I can go shopping on our way home so that's the plan for today I will check in with y'all later all right so I made it to the airport and there's been maybe cars here oh the cars in Boston there is 90 cars here but it's only a very very small fraction of the drivers we get out of here so any go all the way I'm gonna put together my shopping list because I overshot them today all right well I'm done with work for the day my energy is kind of dipping a little bit but I'm getting ready to head in the Trader Joe's here and start my grocery shopping so I did get my lists done and I don't think that there's not too much that I have to get as far as like meats and produce because I already still have quite a bit but I do need to get still some spices and stuff that before the rest piece of my aunt sent me so we that brown line is terrible I got to stop brown on my eyebrows anyhow get ready to head in Cheerios and then I'm going to hop over to all these and hopefully I can get everything between those two places now 70 where else cuz I still I gotta go take my car into the shop today too so that's where we're at right now I put in groceries away just figured I'd show this Gina Kraft said ground beef 407 at Walmart got three of them because they were on sale and his wonderful delicious salad for dinner and the kid hates me right now because she doesn't want the sound but guess what that's what we got eat fibers so that we can go number two we have some pork tenderloin sell in the oven right now but it's not cooked yet yeah salad and pork tenderloin for dinner child is still having a fit about salad you need to eat it you don't care anything else until it's done and while I'm waiting because I wanted something sweet and it's been five days with no sugar no carbohydrates so I took some heavy cream and a pinch of Splenda and a drop or two of vanilla extract and whipped up some whipped cream here for a sweet treat for once somebody is done with a salad but in the meantime mom is gonna have hers it's day six I got my coffee making some baked and I know I said I wasn't going to weigh in all the time but let me just tell you I did this morning not gonna lie and y'all are going to freak when you see the numbers on the scale on Saturday watching and out the doors second day in a row I'm on time only kind of not because I stress you guys last night excited about the weigh-in one thing to note though one of the side effects of this can be joint pain I know I've seen that somewhere my needs today are really really sore and we guys not that length so I'm a little concerned about that I need to look up and find out what kind of remedy there is besides just popping ibuprofen we're done with work for the day an unexpected half day today ass issues right now we are making cauliflower crust pizza I needed it set one egg but I put a little more cauliflower than they requested the recipe so I put two eggs and then I need Parmesan cheese 1 cup of that I don't even know I took this box off I think this one is a mix and cadence of parmesan and Romano and rare beyond oh and I'll Dion O's or rice cauliflower that I cooked some of the moisture out of on low for about 10 or 15 minutes about 3 cups the recipe itself called for 2 cups but I had a little more than that so we're just gonna make a little bit of a bigger pizza but that's why I used the extra egg now I've got that all mixed up the recipe said create form a bowl and press out on the pan bit of a fall there of some sort it's that on to my parchment lined baking sheet maybe two eggs is a bad idea look at how it turns out when it comes out I've been preheated to 400 my oven runs a little hot so I've actually got a preheated to like about 385 ish says to press in an even kind of crust you don't want the edges really thin or they will burn to keep the edges a little bit thicker first it's going to bake and then I put toppings on and then bake it a little bit longer so I don't want my crust that will not have toppings on it to burns and see all the little cheese bits which should melt down and hold this together really nicely so if you do decide to do this and use two cups of cauliflower one cup of parmesan and one egg is the actual recipe probably add some spices to it which I didn't do because I'm going to add those into my soft I've got to make my sauce because I did not buy regular pizza sauce because it's got too much sugar in it show you what it looks like here looking good looks good to make six open a sauce I used some of the Thunder scent natural tomato sauce which has 2 grams of sugars in quarter cup so not a whole lot of sugar and a can of diced tomatoes which has 3 grams of sugar in a half a cup I got some pink Himalayan salt some black pepper onion powder Italian seasoning and of course some garlic will probably end up putting maybe a grand total of half a cup on top of pizza and the rest of it I'm going to put in baggies on freeze for if I decide to do any like butter what is it spaghetti squash so I've got that already made alright well I put the timer on for 15 minutes we'll check it out see what it's do do it Bob line up in the middle type system looks a little bit wet I'm in there but looking good so I wish y'all could smell this because it smells delicious I just pulled this out I think I had it in for a total of 19 minutes or so maybe 20 it doesn't say that I have to let it cool yet since just go ahead and top I'm going to go ahead a little bit of sass every time I've tried doing one of these crusts it never holds up to us I don't want to make this too saucy this time around this looks like a pretty solid crust looking good so far I'm excited about that again the carbs in the sauce there's no added sugar in this but there is still sugar in the tips from the tomatoes because tomatoes are a fruit and they still have carbohydrates I want to do some mushrooms load this puppy up Aylin mushrooms and I washed these and kind of dried them off on a paper towel before cut them out so they're not going to add too much moisture to it because that tends to make them fall apart or at least it has the last couple I tried this is a new recipe baby girl like pepperoni for the pepperoni football one like a little bit of the oil but I don't like mine too early just a little bit of popcorn me last but certainly not yet cheese because you know the cheese in the crust was not not just enough to make it more like pizza and cauliflower loaf stay put I'll be back in the oven for another 10 minutes and we'll bring you back to show you how it looks okay so oh and gee guys look at that piece of how delicious does that look so acceptable which is trying to pizza first reaction careful what do you think okay we like it as far as texture thickness hold together ability I mean it's it's good it's good I'm the way I put the top of them though they're kind of falling off but I mean that seems like I said crust so it's a little messy but it's good hmmm I think maybe next time if I want to get it a little bit crisp crisper I'll make it a little bit thinner maybe just do like a square pan instead of trying to make a round and they get a little bit thinner use maybe a little bit less cauliflower because the cheese - cauliflower ratio I think I could have used a little less cauliflower a little more cheese but than that I mean I'm thrilled with it I think it's fantastic all right guys and stops random thought for this morning pickle juice yesterday I was talking about my joint pain that I was having and everything I read said that it is a loss of electrolyte they talked about using chicken broth to replenish the electrolytes but as I was packing baby girls lunch today I put in some pickles I was just thinking because an ounce of pickles contains 220 milligrams of sodium there's no carbohydrates mrs. bill pickles kosher salt the spheres water vinegar salt calcium fluoride polysorbate natural flavors Nero number 5 now I don't know about the natural players meal number 5 but sodium how much rises up this line because the flavor is a little more tolerable than just plain chicken broth knowledge know how close at this point in time I am I do got my coffee to to wash it down with that's my breakfast making Bane gross referencing is bacon making scrambled eggs and I put together lunch also something I wanted to show you is these stick at Trader Joe's they're called chops now whole stick has 100 calories and it's got 9 grams of protein second Simon half has born 1/2 grams of protein and it only has 50 calories I forgot to check the fat content in it but it's a hundred percent grass-fed gluten free no antibiotics under percent grass-fed beef so just as a little lunch addition or a little energy snack I got those they were like a dollar a dollar seventy nine maybe per stick so I bought like five of them just come and have to let me like ten servings alright so I am prepping dinner for liter because I'm not throw everything in the crock-pot here I'm using up that pork butt I bought last week which is eight pounds of pork butts I'm making a shredded pork chili so I figure by the time this cooks up in the crock-pot that but we'll be falling apart so this recipe calls for one was it a culture two pounds of beef report and one onion but I'm going to do eight pounds and one onion because onions have a pretty high carb content not exactly sure what I know I where they have a pretty high content and are not actually recommended very highly in the keto diet it also calls for a small bell peppers again bell peppers have a lot of show natural sugars in them I'm only going to use two with the eight pounds of pork but the carb content per serving this is going to be relatively low and I know these look like awfully big pieces but they're going to cook all day in the slow cooker so they will cook down to next to nothing really a lot of preparations but payoff per crockpot meal is huge I love crock pot meals I'm going to be looking into getting a low carb crock pot cookbook because I usually try to do all the preparation night before and have everything just in the fridge in containers and throw it all together in the morning before I go to work well since I don't have to work today I figured I would go ahead and do this this morning after they rip it up school this is going to add a lot of time to my video I'm going to attempt to cut out a lot of the rim random rambling the musings here another thing that's recipe calls for is a packet of mccormick original chili seasoning now mccormick original chili seasoning has wheat something-or-other in it it's also got multiple dextran and it's also got sugar instead of using the mccormick chili powder I decided to make my own blend using the main ingredients listed on the core make chili powder packet first and most importantly 1/2 that chili powder because I'm doing 8 pounds of the pork I used 4 teaspoons of chili powder I use one teaspoon of cayenne 1 TSP milk half a teaspoon because I don't want a too sweet too spicy for baby girl I used half a teaspoon of paprika I use a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder I use a half teaspoon of onion powder 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and also a teaspoon of cumin that's what I used in my spice blend here this I'm going to do backwards I think I put the hold veggies down at the bottom usually I put the videos on the top I want to do my crock pot but this is saying to put the onions and peppers in the front platform so we'll do it that way there are some Brown the torque or the beef but that's using ground pork or beef this is a bill roast so I'm not going to do that I'm just going to row to the crop button hope for the best and it's definitely a but look at all that fattiness huh little bit it's dust but it'll fit well that would have been embarrassing to get all the way here to this point and the roast not fit my crock-pot note to self next time get like a 6 or 7 Tom roast I needed crushed tomatoes as well of course I use my actual diced tomatoes that I got for this last night in my spaghetti sauce so I don't have to improvise and use this may doesn't ship green chili this is how I cook I plan when I plan and I always forget at least one thing and I have to improvise pour that over the meat there and all the acids in the tomatoes I'm assuming well kind of breakdown me oh it's cultural tomato paste that's going to make it thicker I think what I'm going to do is I'm gonna let this cook a little bit before I add the tomato paste and once it starts to cook and get a little bit smaller I'm going to add it in around the size of the rose or well I must make it under the roof I don't want it creating a fog on top of the road I should probably read the directions before I start going right later or not I did I read them like three guys and I'm still doing things backwards communicates down here underneath I should just do a channel cooking keto with Jess what do you think let anybody watch that let me know down below cooking keto with Jack and that's how I give a lot of my recipes is by watching people do them online this one my aunt sent me it was a what's called caveman chili if you look up caveman chili author I'm going to give credit to is caveman keto so caveman keto I am altering your recipe but I'm using your recipe my seasoning again you're not even watching what I'm doing over here how ridiculous you're looking at me you know I don't want to see me you want to see what I'm doing alright so that's what I'm doing here that's a load of seasoning I may have overdone it a pinch but you know there's not a lot of salt it's mostly chili and cumin and cayenne so and it's a pot of chili so it's supposed to be spicy right I like it spicy kid might need a little bit of sour cream or cream cheese or something to mute the spice but we shall see I got a feeling I'm not going to have enough containers for this I'm going to have to put it in plastic bags tap on and that's had to go now can go right here and put a stop I blew the girls school and drop off a letter and then I'll go get my hair cut and then I will head out and take your business in Boston and I've had my coffee I'm gonna you know I'm just gonna bring some water with me I think that'll be fine for me because I did have two cups of coffee this morning because I felt like I needed the extra boost of energy all right I just got my hair bed I'm going to took off about an inch maybe an inch and a half feeling so fresh and so clean clean on my way to Boston well I guess that's out of the question because I just went to google map it and it turns out that they're closed on Fridays go figure so now I got to figure out what the heck I'm going to do didn't you go to the grocery store and I'll put the rest of video in my work in progress for the week but today's a bust I guess I just killed an hour and a half in Walmart because I figured if I'm gonna be stuck at home today I'm going to do some meal prep so I had to get a couple of things for that so now we go home and we do some meal clear again so we're something like four or five hours in I just flipped the butt and one thing I forgot was the recipe did call for like eight slices of bacon so I excused some actually didn't use bacon I used salt pork and I do some of that on the griddle real quick and pried it up and just added a couple pieces in there for flavor so that's what we're looking at so far it is not coming apart yet I think so gonna cup more hours to cook and we'll see how it comes out this evening all right so let's chat up today making some cracks laws called Christie's crack slow my aunt sent me the recipe is that all this stuff in it fresh ginger there and I will list the recipe in the description box [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and [Music] all right so next I'm going to make some brownies coconut flour unsweetened cocoa sugar for you chocolate chips some stevia vanilla half an avocado of baking powder and once again I will put the recipe I'm using down in the description below so I haven't quite done to the brownie chip but I had to try this because it just smells amazing mmm the cabbage needs to go down a bit more but this is so good oh my god guys it tastes like tastes like Chinese food I can't even explain it it's so good I figured this would be my lunch for the day close doesn't mean anything since my coffee this morning so it's time I'm hungry and I definitely needed something on where do we go I'm getting ready to put these into the oven I'm a little concerned to texture more kind of like cookie dough it's not not very liquidy it's more like cookie dough so I'm afraid these are going to be a little dry cuz I use the coconut flour and maybe I should have put some more water in them or maybe another egg I did the two egg suggestions we're hoping that flour so we'll see how they turn out so the brownies are done should it be concerning with the chocolate chips can it melt kind of dry not gonna lie so well I'll let you know later on how it tastes it does seem kind of dry but just see an elf like that's the size of my pan here so they said that that's two servings this next risk am doing is bacon aids it's a three free full recipe one it helps me use up some of the bacon grease that I've been saving to I get to play with my brand new toy which is an immersion blender and this one actually came with a cool little whisk attachment and third fold is it will be a condiment for the next recipe I'm going to make which is some ham and egg and cheese roll ups for pre-made breakfast for the week so I will again put the recipe down below but essentially it's two egg yolks a tablespoon of mustard which is optional three tablespoons of lemon juice separated and then a cup of your bacon grease we can see what it looks like here I've got these new sticky things up on my cabinet for holding my phone so we'll see how well they work it made probably just a little over a cup and a half with everything in it keep it in the refrigerator so it doesn't spoil all right guys so my very last recipe is going to be some ham egg and cheese baked roll-ups and it takes ten eggs a cup of spinach a cup and a half of cheese some garlic powder salt and pepper and then of course some ham this ham I got at Walmart it's great value smoked ham water added on it was the only ham that I could find that they had that have zero sugar and if everything else was maple or honey or blackboard or whatever had a ton of sugar in it so that's what I got for this one [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yep that totally just happened dang it on the bright side my floors needs to be slept anyways so got it done early [Applause] now we're going to go ahead and start forming the roll-ups they said on the recipe to use 20 pieces of ham now since I'm using these big old things I'm just going to use half at these ten so you take the ham and you put some of your egg and spinach mixture in it and since I used ten eggs I'm going to try to grab like egg sized chunks of the mixture and then you roll it carefully and then you place it over here into I've got a pre-greased container here to put it steam side down I'm going to go ahead and roll these real quick and we'll get these little suckers in the other [Applause] okay [Music] [Applause] so I managed to fit a dozen in the Pyrex container and if the container is bigger than mine you could probably do about 14 rolls that size I'm curious how this it's good what aren't y'all hungry watching all this I've been cook them all day all right so that says to put it in under the broiler at which I've preheated for about five minutes until the bacon gets crispy so like I said my oven temps run hot so I'm going to keep a real careful eye on that and hopefully not burn it because then the baby girl won't eat it that's the whole point of these is trying to get something that I can sneak some spinach into that she'll eat all right the fruits of my labor today I got brownies for dessert I got some cracks law for my lunches this week and then we have some ham roll-ups for our breakfast just a note I put the toothpicks in after I took it out of the oven to hold the hand down because I had flipped the little rolls over to cook the backside after the first five minutes and then did another four minutes to cook the top side so don't insert toothpicks if you have it boiling where they will catch fire and finally my pork butt chili soup right took a nice big giant butcher knife and forth to this to kind of bust up some of the meat a little bit more liquidy than I would have liked but it still looks and smells delicious I think if I attempt to do this one again I will probably drain the diced tomatoes or maybe just omit them entirely and maybe use about half the onion and pepper that I use this time because it's okay it did end up with quite a lot of soupy liquid so but it does look fantastic Danielle is still here my goodness I'm shocked if you've made it this far I am shocked because I've got like five hours of video just from today to try to condense into oh hopefully about maybe 15 or 20 minutes considering the fact that what I've got so far is already about half an hour for the week you've just been a very long week thank you all for hanging in with me and it's Saturday on my end now so we're going to go ahead and do our weigh-ins and final thoughts all right so I am at 3:20 I started the week at 326 so that puts me down six pounds for the week big girl is down a pound and a half about a pound 0.3 for the week which for her it's pretty good she doesn't need to lose as much weight as I do energy is definitely better morale is definitely better I and I'm not finding myself to be as cranky as I did now that I've weaned off of the sugar you know all in all I'm very excited about the process the digestive issues I expected to be on the other end of the spectrum but I need to work more fiber into my program as far as ki tofu my people only thing that I've been suffering from really is been the joint pain I mean and I think that is because I tend to salt my food in general a little more heavily than the average person I like salt she is more of a sugar feed and more of the salt fiend so but like carbohydrates insult been a good week so far I'm not feeling hungry which is awesome like I haven't lost this much weight in a week since doing crazy things like the soup diet or I've lost this kind of weight on Nutrisystem but nature system was very hard to maintain because there was a lot of soy in their products and that it did not do well with my stomach I think this is definitely a lot more maintainable a lot easier to do it sounds like when I first heard about the diet answer reading up about it it sounded very complicated and I mean all all except for like giving up all the foods that I've grown to love over my life it's definitely been a lot easier you know I think the hard part the hardest part has been eating foods that I grew up being told were bad for me like bacon and eggs and like avocados only in moderation and the fatty meats like this is stuff that I'm not used to eating it which is why I thought that I would have a little more digestive issues than I do but no I'm actually very surprised that I haven't but yet getting used to eating those types of foods has definitely been an interesting process I mean like I feel like a kid in a candy store when I get to go buy meatza I'm like I gotta find the fattiest piece of meat I can find the fatty of steak or you know I get to eat chicken thighs which is my favorite I mean who really likes to eat chicken breast come on I mean unless it's smothered in sauces they're dry so I like the thighs I like the drumsticks so that's been cool so for week 1 I think I'm doing pretty well I'm excited to see how this goes along and if you're still here watching this I mean kudos to you for for sticking around this long and thank you so much for your support and keep on watching because I'll be here so if you like this video give it a like down below that helps get

all right bye", "5mpmhelaLyU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what do we have here Laver man national flavor bed [Music] what's going on crazy news crazy it's been a crazy few days it's been a crazy week it's been we I mean we had the whole lung issue issue we had the Mishkan thing and now we have this going on it's not good it's been pretty insane it's been pretty crazy but I do want to chat with you guys just for a little bit this is not live mixing we're still doing live mixing tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Eastern here on the DIY or Die Channel let me do that yeah we're still doing live mixing tomorrow this is just one chat with you guys I want to kind of fill you guys in on some of my thoughts let you guys answer any questions that you guys might have I've seen a lot of questions going on and I figure this could be a good way to just concentrate all of these concerns and questions into one video so first I want to play a couple videos I don't know if I want to get in trouble for doing this I don't know if I'll get a strike or anything but I do want to play a little clip from CNN Greg Connolly of the American vaping Association was on two programs that I saw today the CNN one as well as the Fox News one which just just ended about an hour ago he did absolutely wonderfully he did better than I thought then I think anyone could have ever done I mean he [ __ ] nailed these interviews so let's just check a couple out here is one with Sanjay Gupta of the CNN anchor team and well just listen I use may be going down but but it seems like it would have been going down even more mr. Connelly without these e-cigarettes on the market because they then go on to use real cigarettes actually no if you have looked at the data you would have found Kenneth Warner David Abraham's other respected public health advocates have posted published articles in journals showing that not only did smoking decrease as experimentation with vaping took off but we saw record-breaking declines in teen smoking teen smoking would not be as low today if youth were not experimenting with vaping products it'd be better if no youth experimented with anything but to pretend smoking rates would be your lower hang on mr. cotton you're saying teenage smoking rates to be even lower and they are lower because of vaping because of e-cigarette use your your products have rapidly denormalized whether or not we approve of it vaping products have rapidly denormalized cigarette smoking and I'll remind you dr. Gupta you were wrong about marijuana you admitted it 20 plus years you were wrong about marijuana and I hope that there aren't body bags on the streets because of policies like these in 20 years when you realize that vaping products are saving lives well this is just going back to the stinging God his ass dude he [ __ ] nailed him with that one Sanjay Gupta if you guys don't remember was a strong advocate against marijuana and it wasn't only and I don't know how many years it was two or three maybe even longer than that it's been a few years when he went on this like apology tour where he basically went on and was like wow I was wrong about marijuana and it has so many medical benefits and blah blah blah and I'm an idiot and my name is dr. Sanjay Gupta my life's name is Gupta pretty crazy pretty crazy Greg went on there and dismantled each and every one of their arguments play a little clip of another one cuz it's just so good man I did I think you guys this will help cut down that yes let's be clear no youth should vape just as no youth should use marijuana cigarettes or alcohol but there's only one product of the US government is proposing to ban 98% plus of the products on the market and potentially send several million ex smoking Americans back to cigarettes that's the part that we are extremely concerned about and disappointed and President Trump for right you believe that vaping helps with smoking cessation and okay if that's the case why are they marketed in Kitty flavors I mean let me just put up for people some of the flavors that it's hard to believe that these are for smoking cessation look at the illustrations I mean unicorn milk cotton candy Froot Loops strawberry milk sour gummies those are clearly marketed to kids see it's really hard this is a problem that we have in vaping it's really hard to advocate for these products for adult smokers when they look like this when they look like this right it's really hard to do that it's just it just hurts the argument because it obviously obviously adults like flavours and they like candies and they're like little treats and pop-tarts and gummies and lollipops adults like them too but when you have the pressure of the downside already enacted and such a full force and you have imagery that follows it like this it's hard it's hard to debate that now there's an argument to be had about look it doesn't even matter about the labeling right it doesn't it doesn't matter about the labeling it it's just it's the flavors themselves you know sour patch gummy flavors watermelon candy it's the flavors themselves that they want it's the flavors of themselves if they have a problem with but I would argue a because if the flavors themselves didn't have this type of marketing if it looked if it looked like if it looked something like this even in any sense of the word like looks something like this it would be a lot easier a lot easier to claim that these are adult cessation products it just allows that it just kind of takes away the argument from them that the products look like this right now you can say that the flavors themselves are enticing that's a debate that I'm willing to have any day of the week I understand that debate I get the concern but when you package it in this you lose that argument you cannot beat someone who says this is a product marketed to kids it's just it's hard to beat that debate the it's you would have to have literally studies that say this type of imagery with these bright colors do not attract children what you would lose because the data says otherwise so if you want to just go on just the flavors right if you were to just go on the flavors and you were to and you were to package and make the product look something like this the imagery side of it is all as out of the question right this this imagery and my opinion does doesn't entice children it's it looks like a pharmaceutical product so when you when you take that imagery out of it it makes the flavor argument more advantageous on your side it just gives you that extra little bit of leverage you take away all that leverage when your products look like this this and this is why so many of us were against this type of marketing man this is what this is why this is why this is why we were so against this type of marketing because it you can't win a debate when they show you products like this you have to change the subject when they say okay but okay but these products are marketed to kids you have to go oh they're not marketed kids kids can't buy them we have to change the subject to harm reduction we had to change the subject to something when you do that it is just as common debate tactics when you do that that means that the other person has that leverage and they're going to use that leverage in that debate they're gonna bring that conversation back right they're gonna constantly bring that conversation back now I'll give you a clear example of this when Greg dismantles Sanjay Gupta here this has been on the wrong side of history with marijuana and hopefully there are no body bags after we realize in 20 years that the same is going on with faith bang listen to what Sanjay Gupta says literally right afterwards he brings this point on back to the to the kid marijuana and I hope that there aren't body bags on the streets because of policies like these in 20 years when you realize the vaping products are saving lives well just just going back to the to the kid use though the youth use if people you see case in point its case in point we're gonna see a time and time and time again trust me I know what I'm talking about and I'm sure that Greg does too I'm sure he's much more qualified to deal with this type of stuff that's why he's so good at this but when you when you can see how he got dismantled in that argument in that piece of data because the data is clear he was on the wrong side of marijuana that was it that's an off point that's where Greg gets that point so instead of harping upon that and trying to defend that point he just goes okay but back to the kid use and then they start to flash these images again and then you're already back on their defensive and then you you have to fight out of this this is the the cancer this is how this cancer destroys a lot of the tobacco harm reduction argument it's a real real big problem right it's a it's a big issue when you can't fight against this type of things they constantly come back to it the constant come back to it now there's another he did another he did another interview on Fox News and bludgers check this out on III I do think he did a [ __ ] great job this week so far particularly fruit flavors are much more likely to be smoke-free than those using tobacco flavors and so industry consumers across this country are worried sick and they at this point very much thinking that President Trump is not on their side and may not deserve a second term as a result it's so interesting because I see you folding in politics in all of this - I am well aware that those 13 million papers will vote so we'll follow this very same president Trump for this Obama has been gone too long health officials are gonna blame vaping so in around and around we go a Gregory commonly should be blaming THC they think thank you the president of the I know what I find so interesting and this is why you could just tell that Greg is such a professional the argument on CNN right is the kid use argument it's the public health argument it's the band everything argument and he's able to take those arguments and dismantle them the way he did on CNN I highly suggest you you try to find the full video of it and watch that whole interview it's great it makes you feel good makes you feel like we got someone good on our team but then you come to Fox News right and we know Fox News his history with Trump his entire argument now changes less so you know he still keeps in some of the facts about how the THC stuff was the issue how these flavors are vital to the success of tobacco harm reduction but he makes it a point throughout that this common strand in this debate is that President Trump [ __ ] up he's [ __ ] up he's gonna lose a shitload of voters millions of voters potentially by enacting a band like this and doing so we know we know that this is a great debate tactic winner on Fox News when you have the attention of the president when you have the attention of conservatives who are historically against this any conservative any conservative libertarian who is watching these events happen and who are supporting the president in this band you're not a conservative you're not a libertarian that's just what it is that's that's antithetical it's antithetical to the common core values of conservatism and libertarianism so taking that you know saying look this is this is an away overstep of government reach this is not good he's gonna potentially lose millions of voters and even here you can hear her in her voice she understands it she gets it this is not good I see you folding in politics in all of this - I am well aware that those 13 million papers will vote so we'll follow this very same president Trump for this yeah and then here you can see her try to defend defend Trump a little bit because obviously it's Fox they got a stay on the squeaky clean side of Trump Obama's been gone too long health officials are complaining so and around and around we go yeah health officials are gonna blame vaping yet there are a lot more voters vaping voters and there are vaping or voting health officials right so great job Greg Connelly man just just just been killing it another thing that I wanted to point up and I don't know if I if I talked about this there's an article by a reason reason has historically been very good on the side of vaping Michael Bloomberg's anti vaping crusade is objectively pro-tobacco I'm gonna post this link down in the comment section right here for you all go read this this is the reason why this stuff is going on today it has nothing to do with melania finding Baron Baron you know smoking a jewel in the bathroom it has nothing to do with any sort of public health has nothing to do with the health with with the THC cartridges it has all to do with money it's all it has all to do with lobbying power money Michael Bloomberg has essentially the the premise of Bloomberg's 160 million dollar campaign which aims to persuade at least 20 cities and states to pass laws banning all flavor tobacco and e-cigarettes is that flavored a liquids are obviously designed to entice children because only children like them this is the mantra Blee false excuse me um so check out this article you're gonna understand that the campaign for tobacco-free kid and Michael Bloomberg this has been uh this is this has been one of the things that this is this is what he's doing this is this is what he's focusing on getting rid of the vaping industry because obviously it hurts his massive big pharma investments and and the whole [ __ ] Nicorette thing and all the other patches like that he wants to be able controllers market and and only allow a small select few that he can profit from into the market excellent excellent article and I and and and it just goes to show you that that the the health the health debate I'm talking about like debate tactics and ways that you can you could try to swing this into a pro vaping argument that you can't lose from because if you debate on topics of health if you debate if you debate on topics of health you're not gonna win that debate the science is clear vaping is ninety five percent say for this book we don't even know if it's if it's if it's that it could be higher could be lower but we know personally that the science states vaping is a lot safer the problem is we don't have any none zero zilch long-term data that can support that so when you try to debate on the topic of health you kind of get backed into a corner cuz then they can't they can just go yeah but we don't really know what's on what's going on with vaping we don't we don't know the long-term effects of it there's no rebuttal there what you can win on is the corruption is is the debate at the the debate about the corruption the money big pharma big tobacco who profits from something like this let's take a look at Autry stock right let's just take a look at ultra stock just the past couple days well maybe ultra is not the best example because they do own jewel which we'll get into in a minute but you can see here the past the past week not too bad all right let's look at Philip Morris also down five days it's it's up about all how many points half a point not too bad let's look at what's the other one lower Lord can I get us can I get a stock ticker always it ll nothing okay I can't find it he's Lorillard and not have a stock all right none the market beat all right I guess they don't I guess they don't let's get bi t be eighties doing good be eighties up half a point British American Tobacco maybe I mean the let's look at Imperial alright Imperial mom Imperial is up pretty a pretty good amount actually about a dollar and a half let's get Reynolds REI oh oh this isn't the right stock alright well anyways as you can see when you get into the corruption angle which is the right angle to get into because it plays more into it plays more into the modern style of debate the corruption the zeitgeist of America the elite you know the elitism of the American politics that's all real funny that's all real fun these days right that's what people like to talk about so you're gonna get more of an emotional response would you play into that that's the sort of that's the sort of style that you need to play with when you're speaking to most people I would say the only time you would really want to harp on studies in health and and you know data specific to that is talking to more of the mother the single mother or just the family the family mother really it seems to do well more with with women for some reason so that those are the sort of like debate tactics that you kind of want to play into with when trying to when when you're trying to really kind of package this as like look this sort of policy this sort of this sort of this sort of rulemaking and legislation it's it's benefiting the people that you don't want to benefit you're putting down the small business you're putting down the tobacco harm reduction products and you're just propping up Big Tobacco you're propping up Big Pharma you're just giving it over to essentially a market that you're claiming that you don't want to give it to right that's the sort of kind of that kind of debate that you want to get into so also yes check out this video I talked to Alex in Sand Wharf who is a cannabis lab director of ten years and we spoke about the vitamin E issue and black market THC products but not just that we spoke about what was interesting about the conversation is we got into how marijuana was able to how this stuff got into marijuana why it was so prevalent why it because this is a lot of people guys 500 people six dead not it is not a small thing this is a very very big issue so the reason why we're having this discussion today it's a catalyst for it now of course this is the THC marijuana stuff and they're coming into vaping nicotine vaping that's just giving them a reason to just come in and ban this so they can prop back up those tobacco taxes but I spoke to him and we got we talked how this sort of became a thing in marijuana and it's you know from the conversation we had it's going to be more of an issue right this is going to be more of a problem unless it completely radically changes the way that a lot of these marijuana cartridges are changed right because you saw the tinctures in the end the flour and all that stuff that's all fine and dandy but it was the cartridges that really got popular because there it's a vapor product people like vapor products because they're they're easy to use they they have great flavor there's no smoke there's no lingering smell they're easy to conceal that's why the Cardos got popular but unfortunately the the manufacturing process is of a little [ __ ] up if you guys have any questions by the way feel free to drop them in I'm sorry I haven't been reading the chat let me see if I can if you guys have anything to say here until big manufacturers get involved to demonstrate how much tax would be if flavors are bent nothing will change US government only cares about money nothing else until the big manufacturer is getting involved and demonstrate how much tax would be lost yeah but the problem is that they'll make more money by banning vaping and getting tobacco tax because tobacco has a higher tax bus Plus tobacco has those settlement agreements that come in and it just benefits them overall they keep tobacco as profitable as possible yes what's up South Africa yeah I'm I wanted to do a little early today I've been very very busy lately and I want to make sure that I kind of get you guys the information that you need I'm gonna be posting up a lot of stuff on my Twitter so follow me over on my Twitter at DIY or Die vaping I've been just posting like a madman over there videos articles links snippets and the same over on the website I added on the website my Twitter feed as well so if you want to you know just stay updated on some stuff it's also up there so I want to use I like Twitter a lot because it's easy to sort a Shawn you know just get the information out there as quickly as possible I don't have to be at a computer essentially to put that information up I just blast it over on my Twitter Facebook is where I'll post mainly like the main stuff like the big stories that the big points stuff like that but if you want everything Twitter's Twitter is a good spot stunt thumb says never point out that vaping deals with cravings for sugar a far bigger threat to health than anything else that's a very good point you know I actually haven't really thought of that that's actually a great [ __ ] point that is AG an excellent health little tidbit that you can add to your debate right when someone's when you're talking about health big look sugar is a huge issue in America right now and we know that vaping deals with a lot of those cravings for sugar and there's no you're you're naughty ingesting anything right you're not ingesting anything your body just metabolizes the sweetness that comes off of it and that's it that's a great point man I like quote-unquote kiddy flavors but how else am I supposed to know what cotton candy is unless they say it totally agree they should limit images fonts colors candy cane etc package needs to change see that's interesting i i completely understand but since your are here i'm assuming that you DIY so it's not too much it's not gonna be too much of an issue for you because you can just mix up whatever the [ __ ] you want and they can just they can label their flavors exactly what it what it is but uh i think that if you were to sell like a cotton candy eliquid and you want to make sure that this stuff doesn't happen say this is ten years ago and we're starting interest over I would recommend look maybe not put cotton candy maybe put you know something else that's that's not cotton candy and then just address it in like a nice clean modern labeling no no you know cartoons on it stuff like that it can be done you know you're gonna have to taste it to really not really maybe have it in the description somewhere or on the website just not not on the bottle not on not on the on the front of the thing where people can hold it up and say this is what they're selling because it becomes a problem since as I've been saying that for a year I've been saying that about cartoonish labels for years we need to police this internally the vapors allowed these labels by purchasing them yes that's another thing - I've been drinking a alpha brain really great stuff actually I thought it was [ __ ] at first but it's a really good stuff but yeah that's another that's a great thing because I do want to point out everyone have everyone plays a role in this I play a role in it you guys play a role in it the showers play a role in it the manufacturers play a role in it the youtubers play a role in it we all played a role in allowing this to get to this point we all have to take responsibility for it it's just the sad truth I don't wanna I don't want to make it seem like this is someone else's issue I personally think my opinions we all played a role in this and we all are responsible for trying to fix it if we wanted to continue my dad quit smoking with lollipops and frizzy pops and gained 50 pounds sweets catered to the addiction portion of the brain yeah interesting I know in terms of like addiction like drug addiction and alcoholism sweets people kind of get a little chubby once they get clean because they're just pounding in a ton of sweets it just seems to like you said kind of give you that reward again that's why sugar is so dangerous the marketing is not a real issue the issues that vape saves lives and they lose money yeah agreed I mean at the end of the day that's really what it is it attracts children yes but children are not not allowed in vape shops and you know and that's the only place that they're going to lose see these labels other than on the Internet well it was also on the internet that's the thing it's all over Instagram I can go on Instagram right now and show you a feed full of labels that you would you know it's despicable there's [ __ ] despicable that's the problem if it was only in shops this wouldn't be a problem even Scott Gottlieb Khanna has said the same thing sort of we'll get into that as well they copy the packaging of the candies such a shame what a what a bad image this gave the entire industry that started that war you're those Tony Tony Anderson all right let's see what else you guys been saying you guys have any questions again drop them in James Mancuso says says so we can't have cool things that remind us of our childhood you can just not now not now not in not not in vaping right I I personally think that it's it's only gonna cause issues it's it's it's to read like I said it's the reason that they have a lot of the ammo against us I get it man you want a cool Gameboy mod and you wanna you know vapor you know you want your bottles of liquid to look like you know cartoons but unfortunately it just it's it's gonna get banned man they're gonna they're gonna say that we're trying to [ __ ] get our kids hooked it's the only night I mean think about it like this if you weren't in vaping and I'm sure a lot of you guys are like me where you're kind of very skeptical people if you weren't in vaping you never smoked and you saw that these products all of a sudden contain nicotine and I wrapped up in these cartoon labels you would think like oh this is obviously big tobacco trying to pre-hook kids because smoking rates are down they want to rehook kids to get them back on nicotine it means it's just that's the natural course of it and we kind of play right right [ __ ] into those hands pretty pretty perfectly man there's a lot you guys you guys are you guys are dropping them in are we what what needs to happen if what needs to happen is if kids are caught vaping they should be punished like they won't graduate I'm or lose their license I don't know about that I started vaping from smoking about two years ago I still feel a lot better than I did before I'm currently working on getting other members of my family to switch to vaping yeah getting them to switch now would be preferable you don't want him to tell it's too late right I have long said that kids need to lose their driver's license as they as they would if they are caught drinking yeah yeah that's interesting actually that would certainly make them suck in that would certainly make them think about it I don't know if they'd stop but I mean I lost my license when I was younger but I was drinking and driving don't do that teenage smoking was way down when I was in high school in the 80s half the damn school smoked cigarettes that doesn't matter that doesn't make sense I don't know if that means it was way down it in the 80s but half the school smoked if the war was really against combating teen addiction to joule they'd go after nicotine levels alright well let's get into that because I think that's the interesting thing we should talk about so Scott got leaved the former commissioner he's not a commissioner anymore of the FDA he put out a thread oh he oh [ __ ] he's on squawk box table let's get on top of this so we're at 5 million now I mean we should do this before it's 15 million and I mean it just these were all introduced without any thought as to whether that it's ok or not right and now here we are at five I mean is it urgent Scott do you think or well it is urgent I mean the unfortunate thing is that these products can be helpful in helping currently addicted adult smokers transition off of combustible cigarettes onto something that's not safe but less harmful these e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustible tobacco but it can't come at the expense of addicting a whole generation hey John to Nick and then they'll need something to get off of this I mean exactly case sense exactly remember when we put forward some of the policies related to vape and we also put forward regulation related to combustible cigarettes to make them less attractive to smokers so we sought to regulate nicotine and combustible cigarettes and also ban menthol and combustible tobacco I think those regulations need to move forward as well simultaneous to putting these new restrictions on e-cigarettes so we don't tip the market back in favor of combustible tobacco for adult smokers we're trying to quit combustible tobacco unfortunately this this problem this crisis this epidemic really was created by one product Joule and in a 20-19 national tobacco survey we're gonna finally have data on how many kids are using Joule because we put into that survey a specific question about what products are kids using so when that full data set is out we're going to know how many kids are actually using Joule as opposed to other brands and there was a hint in a warning letter that FDA issued on Monday to Jewell accusing them frankly withholding information from the agency there was a hint in that letter that suggested that it's a very high number that the agency knows that a very high percentage of kids who are vaping are using the Joule proc okay so that's actually pretty I'm pretty bullish on this Gottlieb had he's been going on about this on his Twitter you can go follow him that Scott Gottlieb MD Jule is the reason for this all this is his this is what he's saying Jule is the reason for this all there was one product that caused this youth epidemic and it was Joule Joule should take the brunt of the regulation they should essentially be dismantled that's kind that's kind of what he's getting at and the fact that millions of vapors are now going to be restricted and possibly resort back to smoking because their favorite flavors are now going to be removed is is it's almost criminal right it's almost criminal because of one company whose sole purpose was to just attract as many people not only that but Jules nicotine levels their new nicotine salt blends 15 [ __ ] milligrams super tiny easy to conceal all this [ __ ] weird stuff about them going to schools all this weird data that they're trying to hold back from the FDA I'm actually very interested where this debate goes now once this this data set does get revealed and we find out exactly what's going on if the regulations were to come down and it only applied to Jul that would be very very interesting that would be very very interesting because we all know open but when we had open vapor this wasn't an issue this was an issue we've had it for many many years we've never had this issue with teen vaping and any anything of this or anything of this sort right and it was it was only until Joule kind of stepped into the game or it just kind of [ __ ] that's exploded in the last couple years and that that that's it's nice to see that godly kind of understands this and he's been he's preaching this I mean he's still he's the the ex FDA Commissioner but he still has some power and hopefully he's relaying this information to Ned and all the other administrators who are going to making this rule unfortunately is it too little too late god is the reason I mean well I posted on my Twitter his whole vague description of this youth epidemic didn't help right he didn't specify only until after he left that this was only a jewel issue I find it very very interesting that after he leaves government appointed commissioner of the FDA that's when he starts saying that jewel is the issue not the rest of the open vaping system or the open vaping ecosystem just jewel kinda you put your little tinfoil hat on right were they forcing him to suppress that information did he leave because of these actions did he leave no like it just raises even more questions so it's gonna be very very interesting man it's gonna be very very interesting guarantee you when Trump says okay time to ban vaping Melania says vaping is bad he's not thinking of this he's thinking of a jewel in his head and that's a problem alright that's a problem because it affects this it doesn't affect just the jewel thread perhaps jewel says its support check this out perhaps jewel says it supports the flivver ban because they may have been one of the few products left on the market after it takes effect haven't been the key driver of this youth youth dem ik its adult vape stories that will bear the brunt of this flavor ban I mean Scott Gottlieb is it's crazy to say he's spot on man he's spot on I showed you guys in the beginning of the of the show this is what jewel this is what you will sing this is what jewel sang statement regarding white house announcement we strongly agree with the need for aggressive category wide action on flavored products we will fully comply with the final FDA policy weren't effective they are all for a flavor ban why because they will have one of the only vapor products allowed on the market that will they will have one of the only vapor products allowed on the market period right that's that's why they would be in favor of a flavor ban these products don't exist should a flavor ban happen they might they might I shouldn't say they won't they might but I highly highly doubt it I highly highly doubt it the reason these products are successful it's it's both - the reason this is successful is because the juice that goes into it is delicious and there's a whole many different flavors and it's fun and the reason the juice is successful is because these products allow us to vape it that way and it's kind of a give and take there and if you get rid of one component you get rid of the other so we know now we know right now we know why all of this is happening why who who's making it happen it's Michael Bloomberg the campaign for tobacco smoke for kids Donald Trump and his administration the FDA is sort of a the pressure on the FDA I don't know if the FDA specifically but you see God leaps saying this stuff and it makes you wonder and it's a turn all-out attack it's a it's a legit war so I've been flooded with many many people asking about hey what the [ __ ] did we do what do we do how do we buffer ourselves from from something like this do I stack up do I should I buy as much nicotine as possible will all this be banned these are questions these are these are mighty fine questions and I aim to answer them now the best of my ability no rules have been put into place mind you right nothing is set in stone the only things that that are really worrying is Michigan if you live in Michigan looks like you might be [ __ ] and some local municipalities I think I heard Florida as well let's let's check the news no nothing yeah I thought I heard Florida was going to ban all vaping just period but I don't see any news yeah I don't see any news claiming that right now but um let's get into sort of what's going on right let's get into sort of how to protect ourselves from this I personally think I don't even know if I should be saying this but I'm going to anyway maybe I'll have to delete this video so right this but I personally think that it doesn't huh it doesn't do you any harm to stock up too low to load up on all ingredients I don't think it hurts you in any way I'll tell you what one if future proofs you write should anything happen you have this stuff needed to - what - whatever but - it's also cost-effective so anytime you buy in mass or in bulk you're saving money you can get the wholesale deals and stuff like that and you'll save money in that way so I think that it on both sides it really doesn't hurt to kind of stay a little bit proactive now what's interesting is that Carolina extract I didn't see this until I was writing some stuff yesterday and I didn't notice this but Carolina extracts they create one of the one of the more popular nicotine's where did they write that I don't know oh here we go yeah they they create one of the one of the more popular nicotine's they have on their website like where is it should I stored nicotine products in the freezer no absolutely not is what Carolina extracts a damage can occur - 100 milligram milliliter nicotine products when oxidizes form near during near freeze-thaw cycles caused by temperature fluctuations of some freezer units but not all some fluctuations are typically caused by the opening of the freezer door and outside weather affecting the efficiency of the unit take typical refrigeration temperatures or even room temperatures are a much safer storage range than 27 to 33 degrees because they are well away from freeze thaw potential so I think that you while you can freeze this stuff and I don't think that you'll really have too much of an issue it looks like the best way that kind of stored is in the refrigerator mainly it seems like if it freezes and then a thaws and then it freezes and then and then a thaws that will cause less of a long-term storage viability so you kind of just if you have like an extra fridge maybe that's where you put it on maybe you can go buy a mini fridge or one of those like fridge chests you can get a freezer as long you just don't long as you make sure that it doesn't [ __ ] ever turn off really but it seems like as long as you can keep it nice and cold so what slows down the the oxidization process but it doesn't freeze it altogether then I think that's probably the best option you can also store your flavorings in there right it's essentially when you freeze stuff it just slows everything down it slows all the molecules down and that's good for flavorings as well because a lot of the reason flavorings are less potent it's because the molecules kind of escape out they're very volatile that's the reason why as soon as you open it you can smell it it's just kind of leaking out and just permeating through the air and just becoming a little tiny bit less potent every time you open that bottle so you throw it in the fridge it kind of slows that that down a little bit and allows it to just last a little bit more how much to get I don't know I really don't that's up to you and how much you vape me i vape one milligram two milligram three millimeter three milligram max so a few gallons right will last me a very very long time a very very long time I mean even a few liters will last me a very very long time so I don't think you need like a big 55-gallon drum to last you a long while I think you know maybe a few gallons is is sufficient right depends though I don't know how much you're vaping I don't know how much what milligram you're vaping at but personally myself a few gallons will probably last me a few maybe five to ten years I mean it's gonna last a [ __ ] long long time one of the things you want to do also is keep it in glass plastic unfortunately permeates it leaks oxygen a little bit so you keep it in glass it just allows a little bit extra protection amber glass preferably just because it kind of blocks out any UV rays or any any light that's gonna damage the product inside so in terms of that that's essentially the most important thing that you really want to stock up on because that's is what's at jeopardy vegetable glycerin propylene glycol bottles scales syringes I don't know sucralose stevia none of that at repartee at all right that those you will always be able to get that flavorings I personally believe you will always be able to get flavorings all right flavorings are not just used in vaping they're used literally in thousands of industries and you shouldn't have any issue with flavorings I actually want to speak to Flora and liquid barn and all these other companies and I'm gonna do a video basically just getting their thoughts and and and what they're up to should anything like this happen I think you guys are gonna appreciate that information but I don't I mean there but if they were to try to ban flavorings they would have to ban flavors they would have to say no one is allowed to buy flavors which is communist right if that were to actually happen that would mean to me we're now living in a communist country and I'm not [ __ ] joking if they were to ban flavors and say no one's allowed to have any flavors that means we're living in a communist country and it's time to get the [ __ ] out that's what that means it's time to go somewhere the [ __ ] else so until then I think we're safe I think we're safe right now if they were to say look only in licensed flavor dealers are allowed to use these small you know batches of flavorings because there's a possibility that you could use it in a vapor product which I don't think is gonna happen but if they were to say that again that means we live in a communist country is not a country that I want to be in flavors are ubiquitous and everything so if they try to restrict that there's you have much bigger problems in vaping you have a country that's restricting your basic liberties do you understand what I'm saying if they ban flavours vaping is the last thing that you should be worried about you should be worried about you living in a communist country because before that even happened I'm already out I'll know when the writing's on the wall I'll let you guys I'll let all my members know on the website DIY or Die vaping calm head over to the shop you can pick up a membership three hours a month I'll let all my members know what I'm doing what's going on but I'm out way before then you have much bigger issues than vaping if your country bans flavors altogether so I think that that's an interesting point again right Trump 2020 make America smoke again yeah man I think you would see what's crazy is he's not a [ __ ] vice guy he doesn't drink he doesn't smoke is there anything like that so this really leads me to believe that this is a Melania this is her [ __ ] what's the one that uh what's the thing that uh Michelle Obama did with the with the obesity stuff I remember it was called how to named in it oh yeah that let's move campaign so this is like this is like her let's move campaign which is not good because they get their [ __ ] campaigns and they become very successful if Melania ends up being this ends up being her swan song and this is what she rides her the rest of her career out on not gonna be good man it's not gonna be good it means I much rather I much rather it be a Trump thing because he's kind of fickle and you never really know with him with it being a Melania thing I mean it's pretty crazy be best I guess right be best gen Jarvis is we already live in an authoritarian nationalistic fascist tyrannical post Orwellian nightmare society I guess you're right I guess you're right about that I'm still holding out a little bit of hope that we're just right now more in a Wild West capitalist country where these big lobbyists and these big conglomerates that just unfortunately just have more money are able to get their way but it does look a little bleak I will say that just remind you if they say that you can't buy flavors that's not a good sign of the health of this country that means it's time to get out it's and I'm not kidding I wish I was kidding about that I'm not kidding if they try to ban flavors you got to move you got to move what is stopping them from banning literally anything that they want right what's stopping them from banning anything that they want it's nothing it's they're just controlling you at this point and they what's crazy Stu they have all your [ __ ] data so they know exactly where you are what you're buying what [ __ ] stores to ban you from it's not good we are living in an Orwellian nightmare I can I can concede on that point can someone tell me about freezing Viji Nick yeah again freezing Nick seems to be okay as long as you you know you keep it frozen like what they were saying here you essentially don't want it to fall out refreeze that's where the issues come in so honestly you just keep it in the fridge man keep it in the fridge and with the VG nicotine it's when you keep it in the fridge and you pull it out it's gonna be very very thick so you need to let it come to room temperature before you use it do not open it while it's [ __ ] thick and cold because you're gonna introduce condensation what's gonna make it taste like [ __ ] and it's gonna make all your juices taste like [ __ ] but it's also not going to distribute the nicotine molecules inside properly so you're gonna get a lot of hot spots and you're not going to really have the inaccurate nicotine level you need to let it come down to room temperature make sure that it's not cold on the outside or how our or cold on the inside give it a really really good shake after that then you can use it Shane and Kaos stop using Google Microsoft yeah good luck with that good luck with that even if you try even if you actively try not to use Google and Microsoft you're still using Google and Microsoft you know what I mean and I don't even think Microsoft is too much of an issue it's more Google it's more just just Google and the government I have a friend who works in national security works for the NSA it's not good guys it's not good I'm not kidding I wish I was kidding but I'm not this is this is not lip service this is not me being you know fun conspiracy Wayne is is like you know we have real big privacy issues right we have we stunts literally every innovation that comes to this country whether it be vaping cryptocurrency marijuana energy you know like any sort of like energy innovations and getting rid of oil and stuff like that we stunt all of them we have a massive issue with meta with shootings and mass shootings we have massive privacy issues in this country what's there to be and we have a looming recession coming right there just talking about the interest rates cutting the interest rates it's not good the reason they're cutting the interest rates is so they can boost the economy because there's a recession coming they want to keep the economy up for the next election so once Trump gets out that's when they can crash that [ __ ] economy and reset it because what goes up bus comes down the economy doesn't ever just go straight up it's a it's a graph it goes up and it goes down so the play is to make you go up when you're in office to make it go down when someone else takes office preferably the next party happens every [ __ ] four years or a tree or eight years rather so we have all these big issues in this country and it's it's just makes things look bleak it makes things look look pretty bleak but that's why I'm here man I'm here to help you we are here to help each other because I learn a lot from from a lot of you guys you know you guys send me you guys send me a lot of cool [ __ ] that keeps me updated on on not just vaping but but other other industries as well and had a Bannu ver and you know it's good to have this information because it's very very important you don't want to be you don't want to be [ __ ] [ __ ] around all right yeah okay there I don't want to get into that one I only want to get into a one there's been a lot of weirdos hopefully they don't ban flora they claim that they made VAP they claim that they that they're made for vape juice but they make the best fruit flavors or for carbonated water I mean again it's they're not done I can see why that would be an issue but they're not a tobacco product tobacco products are the issue right a tobacco product flavorings are not a tobacco product especially flavorings that are just flavorings like they're not even in VG they can't be vaped alone that even that removes it even further from a tobacco product and I would have 100 III do not doubt that if anything like that were to happen that they would sue because I I know them they they care they really care about this industry and they want to they want to remain around for a long time and they want to really remain a pillar in tobacco harm reduction they can't do so if they have something like you know a lot of [ __ ] going on so I'm sure that they'll fight back it's a worldwide issue but it's not one person or one group it's a bunch of warning it's a bunch of warring tyrannical tribes of trans humanistic eugenicist s-- who want to build a master race sound familiar managing your scaring me Jim you scared me go tell my mommy I go see my mommy but yeah it's I don't know if I'd go that far or trans humanistic you Genesis to build a master race I mean possibly possibly I don't want to rule that out because we have seen that before and it does sound familiar but I think it just more to do with money and control you know money in control at the end of the day we're running out of resources on this planet the planets warming up we got to be able to control it and profit as much as possible that way when the when the time comes those people can jump the [ __ ] off the planet go to the next planet and you know [ __ ] that one up you didn't address the question the elephant in the room are they going to prohibit nicotine from consumer purchase okay so again we can get in we can get into this one again I personally think that if they were to ban nicotine prohibit nicotine from consumer purchase then they would just essentially mean that they're banning vaping right because what nicotine is is essentially just unflavored eliquid that's really what it is it's just unflavored eliquid so maybe they'll put a cap on on it so that you can only buy like three to six to 12 milligram nicotine unflavored I can't see them banning nicotine but keeping vaping around because it just doesn't really make much sense in that manner I mean they possibly can they possibly can and they can really just restrict only a couple companies oh that's the biggest problem with nicotine only a couple companies sell it you know it's not like a massive it's not like a [ __ ] you know I don't know water or or milk or something where a bunch of companies sell that product there's only a couple of companies really selling nicotine so it would be pretty it would be pretty easy with for it them also and I don't condone any illegal or black market or gray market activities but with that being said vaping is not banned in other countries and I'll just leave it at that I'll just leave it at bad that's the big worry though so that if the if if there's one thing you take away from this it's that stock up on that particular thing right because everything else is pretty much safe I would just make sure that you have some that it won't hurt it's gonna be cost effective you'll have it for a long time maybe buy enough if you have the money right buy enough that you can maybe give it to some of your friends who don't who don't mix or don't don't DIY just say like look this is this is some future-proofing stuff but in terms of like in terms of the actual are they gonna ban it it's too early to tell I personally don't think so I think that they would just ban vaping at that point but I mean what's what's the the law though from what they're saying the law is you can't everything other than tobacco flavor nicotine will essentially be banned and nicotine is not anything it's not flavoring anything it's just nicotine it's technically tobacco flavored nikidik is if you were to vape it is just tobacco flavored so they would have to ban that they would had to say no vaping no one's allowed to vape no one's allowed to buy any freebase nicotine you're not allowed to vape nothing you know what I mean like it you would have to stop people selling unflavored e-liquid buying a do research says buying up everything just bought 1200 dollars worth of flavors two weeks ago placing another today yeah you're stopping up for the for the apocalypse huh also don't want to I do want to let you guys know I created a subreddit specifically for doomsday prepping for vaping right specifically for what we're talking about in this video it's called our slash doomsday vapors I actually created this a few years ago it's it's quite an old subreddit I just never used how many years ago has it's been three years ago I created this yeah three years ago I created this subreddit and I just created it just in case just to have it just if if this were to happen that then we would have a place where we can discuss storage techniques but not just illiquid but also modding just independent vaping all together it's called our slash doomsday underscore vapors you can go subscribe over there like I said it's pretty much never been used there's only a few posts up on there now but if you want to start you know discussing with each other long-term storage techniques what storage what storage options you should buy what's the best nicotine or what's the best product for long-term storage stuff like that modding techniques you know where you can buy certain stuff all that stuff should go to our slash doomsday vapors and I'm really much I'm pretty much the only mod in there I'll probably add some other mods once it gets a little bit bigger but I think it'll be just a good help for for people who do want to prep because I mean I'm prepping I'll just put it that way I'm prepping just a little bit because you just never know man you just never know I'm also a weird sort of paranoid conspiracy theorist sometimes and I don't think that vaping really it's in a good position to win this fight DIY vaping on the other hand I don't think that they give a [ __ ] about it no one [ __ ] mixes their own e-liquid no one there's such a small amount of people that make it their own eliquid I really don't think that they care about it you know does if it gets some people are saying this is gonna explode DIY vaping is gonna be the new wave I don't even think so I think most of these people are just gonna not vape and they're gonna smoke again I really really think that why because we have DIY vapors who mix for a year sell vape for a year so and then they go back to smoking and they're bored of it it's just a little too much of a learning curve I guess for the average American so I don't think there's gonna be this massive industry push to DIY it'll probably grow for sure I've already seen the numbers they're growing but I don't think it's gonna be like this huge epidemic of black market sales possibly I could be wrong I spoke just I spoke to a reporter today about this and I could but I could I could possibly be wrong but I just don't really see it that way I don't really see it that way it would have already been we've already would have seen it I think so we'll see maybe I hope I'm wrong I hope more people get into it but I don't know we'll see I'm curious to know what you guys do you guys think that I'm curious to know do you guys think that DIY is going to be the next mainstream if a band like this were to enact or do you think that most people are just gonna go back to smoking most people are just not gonna give a [ __ ] that's what I'm kind of leaning more on this to the latter I really think maybe 5% of the hobbyist vapors which is like 1% of the mainstream market I think those will move over to DIY and that's about it maybe it'll be this small underground weird little you know community that we have but I don't think it's gonna reach the numbers that we've seen with like 13 million vapors I don't think we're gonna bring over even half that to DIY Nefarian says I'm going to be the Al Capone of ejuice but without the syphilis I've seen a lot of you can pry my veep from my cold dead hands going around that's another thing that I think is gonna happen I think and they're gonna need to really enforce this because I think that most people are just not even gonna listen to it I think you're gonna actually have to enforce it basically you know I'm sure there's people like vape shops who don't even know what's going on it's just they're kind of in their own world friction says most people will just smoke yeah that that's sort of what I think man that's sort of what I think it's pretty sad you know it's it's been for watching right now good [ __ ] what's up everyone welcome to the DIY or Die Channel all the information that you need always goes up over here Instagram DIY dye vaping twitch I stream on Twitch but I'm going to change that to my Twitter at the hour at I vaping and my website do whatever DIY baby calm one-shots a lot of people were talking about one shots are one shots going to be the future I don't know again if we're talking legality if tobacco product tobacco flavored vapor products are only allowed on the market a one shot doesn't necessarily fit the bill it doesn't necessarily fit that that description it's not a vapor product you can't vape on one shot you can't take a one shot and drip it in baby you have to manufacture it you have to you know put [ __ ] together to create that product there's also no nicotine in it so it's not a tobacco product at all it's just it's just flavorings at that point the problem is is that it's still gonna kind of disrupt the market a little bit there's already you know tons of one-shots in the UK a lot of the main companies in the u.s. already have one shots they can just sell one shot to the US it'll probably be propped up a little bit but I think we're gonna see an interesting sort of fight play out there because you know a lot of these companies have a lot of money right they have a lot of money they they're there they have a lot of money and they're run by people who are a lot younger than the average sort of like CEO with a lot of money so they're a little bit frog year there they're gonna be they're gonna be you know willing to fight a little bit harder for their for the revenue streams which I I respect and I think now is a good time that we should be really really supporting our illiquid companies and in our our vape shops and all the people who make these products now is a now's not a good time to be fighting with them we should be supporting them we should be behind them we got to come together we got to fight this ship and it's it's it's gonna take all of us it's gonna take all of us what's another thing that I wanted to talk about anything that you guys any questions you guys have I had something else I want to talk about I'm drawing a blank here I've been I've been non-stop past few days memo Lisa don't worry about global warming they're fixing that with geoengineering I still worry about it I still worry about it it's not good I worry about a lot though most people will choose the path of least resistance smoking says theorist yeah most of you guys seem like most people are gonna go back to smoking stump them says depends if DIY or step up well it's not quite the DI wires it's it's the person they gotta be willing to buy it they gotta be willing to buy themselves into it which is a big kind of cost prohibit prohibitive factor and also they gotta be willing to kind of stick with it and I know a lot of people who were like yeah I want to make my own juice they see me do it and they kind of want to get into it they do it for a couple weeks and then you see them back on naked or you know you see them back on you know unicorn puke or whatever it'll grow but not much this do be Britney Britney Royce is I have a lot of friends that have said they will just go back to smoking so no I haven't even begun to DIY but I rather DIY than smoke nice yeah why is easy that's a nice talking the reporter today I said there is one factor that will that I think is the reason why I think a black mark could be very popular in vaping is because it doesn't cost a lot to get started and it's very easy it's not like manufacturing your own alcohol that takes hey thank you so much Tony D for the donation oh crap ten ten ten bucks much appreciated Oh for all you're doing Thank You Man much appreciate much love but yeah I was talking to her I was saying like look with alcohol you need to [ __ ] have a whole sort of like distillation thing going on you need a lot of room but cost a lot of money and the profit margins aren't that aren't that aren't that high only with tobacco you need a [ __ ] farm you you know you need to have like a legit plot of land you need to have the right sort of crop need to have the right seed need to have the right fertilizer you need to have the right equipment to extract the tobacco not very easy marijuana cultivation right another another thing cost a lot of money you know you need a lot of equipment you need a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ] you need lights you need a hydroponics you need a whole [ __ ] system you need to wait a [ __ ] you know cover it from like radar so if we put though to the SWAT teams don't come in and [ __ ] you know bust you and [ __ ] too much with eliquid you just go online you buy a couple ingredients you literally just [ __ ] dump it into a bottle you shake it and you're you're done and you can charge 30 bucks it's insane so that's one factor that I said that could be that could be something that I'm under estimating because I don't think the black market is going to be massive like some people are saying but that's just an opinion I have based upon data that I've seen in the last couple years I could be completely wrong this critic [ __ ] explode to be the biggest black market we've ever seen because it's so easy to make illiquid so cheap and there's so much profit potential plus it's 30 bucks retail if you add a black market tax you could charge 60 bucks for that [ __ ] that's 600 times the profit that you can make that's those are insane profits so I could be wrong this could be the biggest black market we could ever see and it would all be it would all be you know spawn spurned from some stupid [ __ ] be best flavor flavor [ __ ] band that they enacted but I I don't I also don't know I I'm also not counting on that a lot of people are lazy and a lot of people don't give a [ __ ] and they'd rather just smoke anyway a lot of people don't care about health a lot of people don't care about saving money most people just don't give a [ __ ] about anything so I could be wrong or I I mean I could be right in that and that fact is well like we'll see alright let's see what else I don't want to stay for too much longer we've been an hour already Jen Jarvis is DIY isn't going to explode in one shot to Mike for a while but a lot of people will go back to smoking or will vape whatever it's available yeah now I I do think that if the one-shot market is sustainable and it's just it's just allowed I do think that the vaping hobbyists will that side will still remain like I don't think that they'll go anywhere but I just think that all the Joule casual Joule users I think that they'll all kind of not [ __ ] around with it but I do think that will kind of remain the hobbyist side which is still fun like that was when we had the most fun in the industry was when it was just hobbyists and people that actually wanted to quit smoking so we'll see like that it's it's really interesting it's gonna be really interesting how this plays out and I don't want you guys to be too alarmed or too afraid that you know we're losing the industry because it's not and nothing is set in stone nothing's concrete this is an administration that talks a lot of [ __ ] we don't really know what's gonna happen yet we don't know how legislation is gonna go we don't know who's ready to actually like put the money down and actually fight this [ __ ] and to sue the FDA or just to sue the FDA the government or whoever needs to be sued you know this is disrupting this is a billion dollar industry there will be there will be consequences for anything like this so don't get too down in the dumps man we still got we still got a lot to play out and you're a DIY er you know you you're pretty much [ __ ] safe you're pretty much [ __ ] safe for the time being don't worry about them like don't worry about not having anything to vape at least for now one-shots our component but it's a murky legal area correct they are a component but you they just there are they're a component if packaged really that's the way I've been told there you can't it's like saying like water as a component of vaping because it's used in its it's used in you know the production of vegetable glycerin or propylene glycol which I don't even think it's true but whatever we'll run with that argument you know if you were to package the water with a vape and a one shot and a nicotine pack then maybe that they'll say hey look you can't do this is the tobacco product but by itself you know it's it's it's it's it's own thing so I think maybe marketing or there's there is a there is that you know murky gray area there but ultimately how does it hold up in court you know how do you hold that up in court you would have to really kind of you would have to actively lose that fight yeah I think that's a fight that could be won you would have to actively lose it well see though most see most black most of the black market on cigs though relates to interstate smuggling to beat high taxes more equal taxes would solve that youth will always be a problem for everything yeah that's a great comment yeah there is a black market on cigarettes people for a [ __ ] in Philadelphia they drive down to Delaware they get him super cheap that bring him up here they sell the onesies they're not called onesies what the [ __ ] are they called Lucy's they saw the Lucy's and you know they get choked out and killed like what's his name Eric garner I think was his name Eric garner am i coming up on BP live tonight I think so I don't know he hasn't said anything to me if he if he messages me I might be down for that I love coming on there all right couple more things let me think do you have anything else need to say you're talking about storage flavors guess why here's some crazy we went on a little vacation for our anniversary went to Montauk and we're kind of hiking around the areas which is like kind of like a beachy woodsy area it came back you know we came back we went to bed woke up then later on that night we went to we're going back to bed Kate goes Wayne come up here and I run up and she's showing me the bed and it's [ __ ] infested with ticks there were like all on our dog I mean we're talking like a hundred 150 ticks all over this poor [ __ ] guy and I guess that they were just filling up and like like once they fill up they kind of like detach and then they were just kind of crawling around it was [ __ ] disgusting man they're just like dealing with that two days of that because you have to [ __ ] it vacuum when you have to get the dog shampoo and like it's just a whole process and then vacuum again but was two days of doing of that and then also dealing with this it's been pretty [ __ ] hectic I've been I've been non-stop and then talking to like reporters and talking to Alex and I'm talking about clients my clients are [ __ ] freaking out it's been pretty crazy what about buying juice from overseas yeah that's something that you probably should be able to do as long as they don't as long as you can get it through the mail if they really you know start searching the mail for vaping products at which they could do then you won't be able to get it overseas but um that remains to be seen I mean you get people [ __ ] send drugs to each other through the mail so we'll see once jewels are been and kids turn to smoking everyone is going to say aha gateway to cigarettes yeah but I hope the vaping in the vaping community is loud enough to prevent that good that I don't have to stock up on water melone so I can make dwayne johnson dwayne johnson i forgot about that that recipe so if people are talking about like Trump like getting him out of office right there's impeachment talks already not because of vaping for mother [ __ ] but the problem is is like who's the next alternative visit a Democrat who's just gonna ban vaping anyway you know it we're really stuck in a hot were a rock in a hard place whatever however that saying goes it's it's not a good we're not in a good spot I think this is a good time to sort of try to get some sort of support from a politician people hate Trump I said this on Facebook one of the things that Democrats love more than diddling little kids is [ __ ] with Trump so getting some sort of support from a Democrat might not be a bad idea you know getting them to say look Trump is wrong he's on the wrong side of history on tobacco harm reduction these props are great we just need to make sure that jewel is not selling their products to kids because they're the only bad actor in this we can get that someone like that then at least we can have someone as backup like okay let's if trump goes through with this we can get him out of here we have our backup and you know who knows how true like how much how much they'll actually hold up to that but it sounds like a like a pretty good option to me right it sounds like something that could be done this is the type of like bipartisanship but with like political [ __ ] that you kind of have to get into but might need to be done it might need to be done vaping is messing with big tobacco industry that's like messing with the oil industry that is true people buy fen all over the web and have it sent to them yeah that's I'm saying like people who send drugs to each other all the time I don't know I I can't see them actively monitoring every [ __ ] package for you know unicorn puke that'll be away there will be a huge waste of [ __ ] resources spending your tax dollars so if I can mailman could search your [ __ ] packages so you're not sending over [ __ ] peanut butter jelly eliquid the - I could see going against the ban Sanders or Warren but neither of them has said anything so far I mean we would have to I don't know I don't know about that they take a lot of money from Big Pharma well I should say one of them takes a lot of money from Big Pharma I don't know on on Sanders now you know one thing that doesn't breed much confidence is this tweet I don't know if it's a real tweet I saw it somewhere let's see if we can see if I can find it it's pretty crazy like I don't even know what's real earn or not in the news anymore like I don't even know if I saw a real tweet from him it could have been some fake news [ __ ] yeah maybe it was fake news I come I was bamboozled goddammit oh yeah whatever yeah I guess he's not said anything about how hard it's hard to really trust any Democrat they're so wishy-washy you you you worried that we would have to make vaping a progressive issue we'd have to say look it can't be a libertarian it can't be a libertarian issue if we want any Democratic support they will not support it that's how they are you need to make it so they they're forced to support it and I don't know if the vaping industry will do that I feel sorry for all the people who won't have jobs in vape shops trying to start all over again lots of income can't pay bills yeah it's so it's it's [ __ ] terrible it's [ __ ] terrible it's terrible but I will say there is hope for these people man marijuana is not banned this is crazy because the whole issue is because of marijuana and the black marker THC [ __ ] but it's not banned and I think it's only going to grow I think more states are gonna legalize it and that could be a way for them to pivot that's a lot of my company has pivoted towards marijuana CBD THC production and not production but development and you know it could be could be a way for them to kind of stay stay stay ahead of the curve and pay their bills it's gonna hurt if they lose a [ __ ] job and and a recession comes in right after that and the housing bars and housing market pop housing market pops it's a lot of like things in the Omaha risin that aren't looking so good and some people are like there's no recession coming there's no [ __ ] housing market bubble there's nothing like this everything's good everything's great it's people are delusional man they're [ __ ] delusional I might be a little bit more paranoid than average persons sure I'm gonna be a little bit more worried than the average person sure but to say that there's nothing on the horizon I mean all the signs are there I just know no point in arguing with these people right there's just they live in their own little [ __ ] lala land the government told us carbs were great for decades oops like I trust him to decide that vaping is bad for you yeah well like when they told you like eating fat was bad and now there's [ __ ] diets that like massively successful diets like the ketogenic diet where all you eat is fat insane and it's they don't know anything no one knows anything that's at the end of the day that's what you could take away from this video no one knows a goddamn thing no true conservative would ban ecigs let alone anything they personally don't like Trump definitely screwing up on this and guns but still better than the comic rats I mean you could say that but look at what he just said you know how is he better when he's banning the same things that they want to [ __ ] ban please explain this he's not better nothing they all [ __ ] suck man they all suck they all suck they [ __ ] tell you one thing and then they do another you have to get that guys you have to get that through your head they don't want to be your friends they don't give a [ __ ] about you they want to take your [ __ ] tax money and then they want to go play with little kids that's all they want to do that's what politics is in America they want to take your tax money they won't give it to themselves and their friends and their family and then they want to go play around with little kids every single politician that I've seen come to the door has done the same thing to say that this guy is better than anyone he's bent he's bailing the same [ __ ] you gotta be out of your mind to say that you've got to be out of your mind why because he tweets a lot he just you know he's mean he's a big meanie to the libs that's why he's better oh brother don't get me started don't get me started are you laughing at me they're quicker you guys will understand that this is this is a hundred percent pure capitalist you're out for everyone's out for themselves the easier this this stay on this planet will be ain't looking out for you man they ain't looking out for you in fact I would say the opposite they're actively looking against you they actively are looking for ways to use you to use your money to use your family's money to use your kid get your kids money you go to [ __ ] school they [ __ ] take a hundred fifty thousand dollars debt right out of them Rory does they turn into an adult they they're [ __ ] in debt $150,000 how are you supposed to buy a [ __ ] house no you gotta live with mom and moms [ __ ] yeah I live in mommy and daddy I'm mommy and daddy are getting taxed out the [ __ ] ass for what for what so they can take more [ __ ] away from you that's why so they can enforce more policy that is against you that's where that money goes what all right okay told me to calm down I hope this ban is a blessing in disguise 15 to 22 million vapers where'd that go in the country if we all vote we good I hope so man I it's hard to really count on the voter app data says it all the time on the Facebook it's it's hard to count on voters they are historically have always voted against their own interests so we'll see jubie's has spoken like a true fellow cynic yes yes yes all right all right everyone I think this is it live mixing tomorrow what should we make that's the thing what should we MIT what what what would be a good like introductions is there there has been a like an influx of like some newbies so what would be a good intro I mean I guess a strawberry milk or something like that I mean I'm always down for that you guys know people love to [ __ ] make like fruit milk plans maybe we could do it like for them or like like a bunch of like fruit milk glands some sort of like cream blends maybe we could do like a variety like one strawberry cream maybe one sort of like fruit one like a tropical fruit blend maybe a tobacco maybe a custard so I think something that will kind of interest the newbie I think would be would be preferable right think about it 5:00 p.m. Eastern right here the hour re-dye on youtube I love you all keep your heads up you're gonna get this we're gonna get through this together flight is not over we're still we don't even know if this is even gonna happen today right we don't know what's gonna happen I will promise you this I will not leave you guys hanging I will be here throughout the thick or the thin I'm here for you say I will say that say say this bin does happen they banned all flavored vapor products they ban all sorts of [ __ ] they make it very very difficult to sort of they make it very difficult for any sort of vaping companies to stay around there probably will be changes on this channel and more specifically on the website I don't exactly know how or what but there will be prop there probably will be some changes but I'll let you guys know what's up with that just cuz I don't I do want to make sure that I can get you guys this information that I'm not getting like so you know my information surprised or getting kicked off platform stuff like that one of the reasons I was

a shower my head's almost up but i'm back with another one this time um i wanted to go with the concentrate form of papas or i i know you guys probably remember i made the video papa's herb for the eighth i don't remember if i posted it yet but you'll probably see it by the time i post this so these are 0.5 and they've been selling them for 10 bucks at one of my liquid dispensaries so i was like let's go try it out and this was jack hair so let me show you a little bit boom little information boom and let me let me give you a little cool shot [Music] all right so let's go ahead open it up we'll check it out and we'll see how this flows boom there's the seal that's interesting smells oh bam and there it is wow looks very clean very golden this is interesting i can't wait to try very interesting i can't wait to try i should have had this prepared but i'm an idiot so here we are all right oh man it's all a little golden car so it's supposed to be a half gram jack herrera let me see um the potency 85 no cbd but 85 425 milligrams of thc from what they say it's never really what they say so we got to be a little bit weary all right guys let's try it out and see what we think of this jacket here no way no way that's the best tasting um wow i knew i had a good choice with the jack herrera whoa that was almost a blinker by the way i just stopped it right before it blinked whoa whoa whoa whoa wow all i can say is well i was not expecting that i was literally expecting a really bad taste normally with like 10 12 cards you get some really harsh in your throat or hurry carts this is not it this is insane i don't know if it's just this one or the jack hair strain or whatever they had a lot of other ones i'm talking about forbidden fruit skizzle skittles or something with a z of the same brand but those were hybrids and indicas and this was a sativa he said i believe yes of teva so wow okay i'm gonna get right to it i'm not gonna make this video too long taste freaking great it's there 10 out of 10. hi haven't felt it yet it's gonna creep up on me so i'm going to wait on that price 10 bucks 10 out of 10. the company i tried the herb you guys if yeah i haven't posted the the review yet but i swear i'm going to post it before i post this video i'm gonna make sure i do that so you get to see which i'm pretty sure it's up there already but you're gonna get to see the difference in everything um in the two the concentrates from the flowers the flower was okay not in the joint but in the bong after i put i cured it i put it in some glass jar and i let it burp and it opened and it it gave life back to their plant and then i hit in the bottom it was great but the joints were not that great this though i mean boom i i can't it's golden it's golden like i can't even explain how gold it is it's beautiful gold i feel like i hit gold so i i don't even know what to do i want to give it a really high rating in my mind the first number that popped up was a nine nine nine like nine nine and a half i want to give it a 10 but nothing in this world is perfect so i'm gonna go ahead oh my god and i want to give it a 9.5 like literally i'm blown out of my mind but the only way i'll give this a real 9.5 or a 10 star is if i get two or three of these in the bro that are legit taste this good blah blah blah of different kinds not of the same kind of this the same kind of program it tastes the same but we got to try some more so let me rip it again i'm starting to feel the high creep up on me so it's not super strong it's a tv you could tell i could focus like a talk and that's what we want oh my god the taste i can't get the taste taste so clean imagine like train wreck as light possible as possible like some sweet train wreck some really sweet or piney earthy oof it tastes it tastes delicious i don't know i thought these were gonna be trash i'm gonna be 100 honest with you i thought this was going to be horrible i thought i was going to have to filter it through my bone because it's going to be it was going to be harsh on my lungs but it feels smooth going down all right papa zerp you get a nine if i get more of these and they are on hand i'm gonna give them a 9.5 for their little cards for 10 bucks so take that for what it is guys you know it's always hit and miss with things you never know what you're gonna get but for going for they've had these on sale for a while surprise no one's buying them out if i had a hundred bucks i'd go buy me 10 of these right now 5.5 for 10 bucks concentrating it tastes good no don't get me wrong you might get some bad ones you bite a lot but for the most part uh i [ __ ] with this i'm gonna go back and get another one for sure i want to try a different one so nine i'm gonna give you a nine pop reserve for your for your point five concentrates and the funny part is they they changed to a new money system in that place where i went so i was literally there for like 10 10 15 minutes waiting for them to try to figure out to put it in the system so they could sell it to me because it wasn't even in the system apparently so that's funny but i'm happy and they have the herb for 15 bucks they should do package deals the eighth and eighth in the car for like 25 bro like 25 out the door dude that'd be amazing they did get a lot of business or 25 plus tags that's 30 bucks you get them 15 bucks each that's cheap 30 bucks herb and concentrate anyways i'm rambling now thank you guys for watching it's your boy dirty 3.0 and if you've tried this let me know what you think in the comment section like this video comment subscribe give to you get get your boy talk to me let me know you know let me know what you're thinking let me know what you're trying what you're smoking on

legal now?\" Not quite. What these companies are selling is actually something called CBD. It's found in everything\nfrom lollipops to lattes. And business is booming. CBD products are part of\nwhat is estimated to be a roughly one billion dollar\nindustry in the United States. And it's perfectly legal. So, what does CBD have\nthat marijuana doesn't? Martin Lee: The fact of the matter is we're kind of in the midst\nof a CBD craze right now. Narrator: Martin Lee is the\ndirector of Project CBD, an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics. Lee: CBD stands for cannabidiol. That's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant\ntherapeutic properties, but it's not intoxicating. It doesn't get you high like THC. Narrator: As it happens, not all cannabis plants are created equal. Take a look at these two varieties. One is marijuana, the other is hemp. One gets you high, the other doesn't. The key difference is\nwhat's on the inside. Lee: THC and CBD are the main components of the cannabis plant. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Dave Chappelle: I don't know about y'all, but I can't even move. Narrator: Hemp, on the other hand, has hardly any THC at all. But what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD. Now, CBD won't get you high, but it does have a redeeming\nquality: it's legal. And at least according to the marketing, it has a relaxing effect. So since this stuff is all the rage, let's see how it's made. So, once you have a cannabis\nplant, one simple way to make extract can be\ndone in your own kitchen. Lee: As simple as using\nolive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant or a little bit of the green\nmaterial from the plant. Obviously that's not very useful for mass industrial production,\nto be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis. Narrator: But the more common way involves a specialized, complex machine. Lee: One very widespread way is using what's called a\nsupercritical CO2 extraction. It's ground up to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind. And it's poured into vessels, literally, of a supercritical CO2 machine. It will stay in that machine\nfor upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of\nthe extraction process. And ultimately you'll end up with a thick, golden oil that's very waxy in texture. Narrator: You can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons. You can find this oil in a number of different products these days. Lee: It can be administered\nin various different forms. It might be ingested, it\nmight be applied topically. Narrator: They even have CBD\noil products for your pets. I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts\nof CBD-infused products. I tried a CBD matcha\nlatte and a CBD macaroon. These snacks tasted great, and I felt a little more relaxed after, but it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head. Scientists are actually\nstill trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body. Lee: So, there really\nis a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work, but we're still really a long\nway of mastering the hows. Narrator: Still, CBD\nmay have more benefits than just a relaxing afternoon. Some initial studies have\nshown that CBD can help with a number of different\nmedical conditions. In fact, in June 2018, the FDA\napproved the first CBD drug, Epidiolex, which is\nused to treat epilepsy. So, who knows? Perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis-decorated\nvans in the future.", "lB-crKr3a5c": "okay thanks for joining me tonight this particular presentation is called physical and behavioral problems often seen in autism troubleshooting these issues and then suggestions for intervention this is a presentation that I have done in the past matter of fact many of the presentations that I've done over the past year are actually available on as movie files and you can also access the color slides to each of these presentations at this particular website autism seminars on demand so this particular presentation is actually available through that website if you'd like a copy of the slides or like to get a more high quality movie recording of this particular presentation before we get started let me just give you some some tips here on some educational material that I've used in my practice and I want you to know about two books these are excellent resource books for you to have in your library the one on the left effective biomedical treatments from dr. Pangborn and Baker this is not a book that you would read from cover to cover but an excellent book to look at with respects to questions about supplements you know issues related to behavior testing some of the biochemistry with respects to biomedical intervention and then the book by dr. Shah the biological treatments for autism is PDD this is one of the first books that I read many many years ago this is a newer version both can be you know accessed through Amazon you can get the biological treatments book from dr. Shah through Great Plains this website two really good books to have in your library I also have a number of online resources autism recovery treatment is a blog site a video blog site where I record video transcribe those videos into articles and then placed here on this site this is all free information and then I also have a very interactive parent subscription website where you as a parent where a caregiver of an individual of autism can really reach me 24/7 through this website through an interactive parent forum doesn't matter where you are in the United States I work with people you know and answer questions for people around the world and it's a great place just from the stand point if you have questions when a troubleshoot you know things ideas on testing questions you may have respects to different therapies that's what this particular site is for I also have many of the recorded webinars on this site too as well as the PDF files that can be downloaded of each you know individual presentation and the color slides for future reference I also recently released a book called autism recovery book.com title is autism the road recovery it's an e-book that you can access if you want to learn more about things that I've discussed things that I discuss through this presentation things that could be found through this book at autism recovery book calm and as I mentioned before the autism seminars ondemand.com is where many of these presentations were re-recorded in a movie file that is downloadable as well as the PDF slides and then finally if you want to just get more information about me you can go to dr. Waller com this is sort of my official website it's the hub of the wheel if you will that has links to many of the other different websites that I have online okay so let's go ahead and get started here what we're going to talk about is common issues seen with kids in the spectra I'm going to troubleshoot some of these problems I'll come up with some treatment suggestions that can help overcome some of the behavioral and physical issues it's always important no matter you know what information you get online whether it's from me and other doctor etc is to discuss some of these supplement recommendations so the medication therapies that come forth with your own child's physician really before trying to implement some of the stuff on your own so we're going to go through a number of thing as we'll talk about abdominal bloating an aggression anxiety diarrhea looks like there's some typos on this that I missed irritability tantrums you know regression issues sleep issues and if you've heard this presentation before I'm really gonna just sort of talk about these things in general but then also give specific things that I've seen in my practice some things that I want you to think about instead of trying to read each individual slide to you that gets pretty boring I really just want to have a discussion with you um things that I've experienced in my practice clinically over the years so I want you to walk away from this presentation with some some things in your back pocket that you can think about with respects to your child when you talk about abdominal bloating there are a number of things to consider and and the first thing that I think about clinically in my practice when I have a child come in who is just distended with in the abdominal area first thing I think of is gas and we know that yeast and bacteria can produce gas specifically yeast and we know that yeast and bread is what causes that expansion so one of the differential diagnosis is for distended abdomen would be a ye and overgrowth of yeast constipation can also be a problem in that backup of stool in the lower bowel can cause the bowel to become swollen and that also can lead to a distended abdomen to also constipation can become a breeding ground for yeast so many kids who actually had are constipated will oftentimes have an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria as well sometimes it gets to the point where it's so significant you need to have some Diagnostics done to you know take a look from an abdominal x-ray to see actually how much stool is actually down in the digestive system so descended abdomen certainly constipation yeast and bacteria some kids actually have a deficiency or the inability to make adequate amount of digestive enzymes there's not a specific test that we have for this that is a hundred percent definitive you can do a comprehensive digestive stool analysis Great Planes has a CDSA test that actually looks at elastase levels which is a reflection of pancreas enzyme output but many times just doing a trial of digestive enzymes can be helpful pep desired enzyme prime are two enzymes that I've used quite a bit in my practice peptide is really more specific for the gluten in the case in zine Prime is a more all-around digestive enzyme for protein fats and carbohydrates these are both from houston enzymes they come in a capsule as well as chewable generally one capsule is equivalent to about two to three chewable taken with meals or large snacks some kids have a hydrochloric acid deficiency difficult to test for and using hydrochloric acid supplementation you have to be cautious particularly with little kids who can't swallow a tablet or a capsule you don't want them chewing a hydrochloric acid capsule or tablet because it can damage their teeth so it's not something that I've used all that commonly in my practice another thing to consider with respects to persistent abdominal distension is just chronic inflammation you may be dealing with a situation where your child has some type of inflammatory bowel problem a lack of intestinal motility is present in some kids it generally can be picked up through endoscopy or colonoscopy where they can you know look at look at the surface lining of the gut sometimes doing further diagnostic testing to look for intestinal motility problems is needed to be done it's not commonly done with kids on the spectrum just because it tends to be more invasive but a lack of intestinal motility can manifest with some kids as constipation so when we're talking about constipation ideally we should all be having a bowel movement for every meal we eat the reality is that doesn't happen so even in most adults if kids are having to mount bowel movements a day that's great many times I'll just take one bowel movement a day the reality is is that we need to get the stool out if we have any hint of constipation the constipation is only going to become a problem with respects to an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria and the bowel toxins that come from that so getting the stool out is of critical importance one of the things that I've seen you know over the years is that many times constipation can lead to aggressive behavior can lead to irritability can lead to moodiness for one what aspect of it is constipation is uncomfortable it causes pressure sometimes pain and then again if we have any sort of concern with respects to yeast or bacteria the constipation is just going to make things worse the ideal thing with respects to stools is that the stool should pass easily they don't necessarily shouldn't come out as a hard log and they shouldn't be real loose but soft and consistency and passed without much effort is ideal various constipating foods breads pasta pizza potatoes cornstarch bananas this will all increase constipation for many children couple of the things to think about with respects to constipation or persistent constipation again yeast and bacteria can cause constipation they can cause diarrhea too but they can also cause constipation parasites as well specifically worms pin worms round worms come to mind you're gonna be hard-pressed to do a stool test and actually find a worm they don't show up very often on stool testing but there are some hints that worms may be present one of them would be chronic constipation another a child who's constantly itching their bottom another is coughing in the morning morning coughing or clearing of the throat can be indicative of worms one of the tell-tale signs or at least one of the suspicious symptoms that seems to occur with worms is a worsening of behavior during the full moon so this is this has been known about now for many many years and as a big suspicion for worm infections not only with you with kids on the spectrum but but a lot of individuals but certainly with kids on the spectrum if there is a clear consistent pattern of a worsening of their behavior during the full moon it's it's pretty suggestive that there may be an underlying worm problem couple different remedies vormax which is also called mob end Azam he is a prescription medication that has been used for pinworms and roundworms 100 200 milligram chewable tablet given 1 twice daily for 3 days usually what I do is I'll give a ver mocks for 3 days wait two weeks and then repeat that dose it's generally easy to take their true but I don't see really any problems with them new beginnings carries some anti-parasitic herbs black walnut extract for example comes to mind after one dropper full 2 to 3 times daily you know for a couple weeks it's not a bad option usually though if I suspect pinworms or roundworms I'm going to be looking to use something like ver box because the reality is is that it tends to work so well couple other things to consider with respects to constipation and remedies for it high dose vitamin C is an option matter of fact this has been a longtime nature Pathak remedy in using ascorbic acid as a powder to what's called bowel tolerance where you just give ever increasing amounts of vitamin C because you can reach a certain point and it has a laxative effect it's not dose dependent based on age or weight its Jo's dependent on what you need to get the job done it could be a thousand milligrams it could be two it could be 10 it could be 20 I had one child that needed 20,000 milligrams of vitamin C in a 24 hour period of time to finally open the floodgates if you will with respects to a persistent constipation problem probiotics have an added benefit not only do they add to the intestinal flora of beneficial bacteria in the gut but if you use a lot of them they can actually cause loose fools so high-dose probiotics can actually have a laxative effect which is beneficial for an individual with constipation again it's not dose dependent based on age or weight it just is a natural reaction of the body to high dose probiotics in some individuals I always like magnesium whether it's citrate or oxide as a remedy for constipation I use that quite a bit 250 to 500 milligrams daily I usually will give it at bedtime so that we can have or at least attempt to have a bowel movement in the morning if possible and then other things to try would be you know aloe vera juice fiber supplements like flax seeds psyllium seeds apple pectin I can't say that any one of these works better than the others and some of it has to do with consistency some of it has to do with taste some of it has to do with what mixes well in a you know para sauce applesauce or a smoothie that your particular child will like another option actually is magnesium you can do magnesium tube al tall it's just like you can vitamin C to bowel tolerance usually don't have to use as much so some kids do you know do fine at 250 others at 500 Summits 750 milligrams I try not to use more than a thousand milligrams of vitamin C either in citrate or oxide on a daily basis for kids so if I was gonna do about tolerance remedy magnesium first ascorbic acid likely lean towards ascorbic acid and then just try to use a regular dose of magnesium you know 250 to 500 milligrams as some added benefit the one thing that you might be consider if you're gonna consider something like ascorbic acid is if your child has some type of known oxalate problem if there is an obsolete concern well then using real high-dose vitamin C is probably not the best thing for them so you know other options can come into play but the bottom line here is is just try to you got to get the poop out and that also means to some some kids need enemas some kids need suppositories to do it true fiber is a great product I really like true fiber since I started using it it's a digestible fiber it's also a prebiotic essentially it's a fertilizer if you will for the good bacteria in the gut one to two tablespoons excuse me one to two teaspoons or a tablespoon daily seems to work well for most kids just as an added product to help with constipation keeping kids hydrated as I mentioned before sometimes need to do laxatives sometimes they need to do an enema you know for two to three days to help unload the lower bowel is really important one thing to keep in mind with respects to constipation there are some kids who appear to be having a bowel movement every day so they actually you know maybe you know produce a three to four to five inch piece of stool and it looks like they're having a normal bowel movement but they still remain really distended their abdomens hard and appear swollen but if you look at their tests they may not have really high levels of yeast or bacteria but if you were to do an x-ray you'll often see in some of these kids a bowel that's overloaded with stool so what's happening well what they're doing is they're pinching off a small section of a larger piece of stool so technically they're constipated but they're actually producing a section of stool every day but they're not completely evacuating the lower bowel this is why when you're dealing with constipation many times if you suspect that there's fecal plug a large section of stool in the lower bound usually you can tell because it comes out really hard and dry which means it's been sitting there a while and the lower intestine has been absorbing the water this is why in some case it's actually better to do some type of a suppository one time daily for 24 hours and 48 hours or you know over a three to four day period of time to try to unplug the lower intestine and then your other remedies whether it's magnesium or vitamin C or aloe vera juice or whatever it may be has a better chance of working throughout the gut so it's sort of trying to unplug the drain before you know adding things to sort try to push stool through the digestive tract so if you're still running into a problem of constipation despite the probiotics despite the fiber just bite the magnesium you're probably dealing with a situation where your child has a fecal plug way down in the lower bowel let's switch gears here and talk about diarrhea what are some things to consider with respects to diarrhea well certainly the number one thing on the list would be infections yeast can cause diarrhea more commonly bacteria and parasites will cause diarrhea and there's a pattern that you need to be pay attention to is the diarrhea continuous or I should say diarrhea and neither lose stools to okay it doesn't necessarily have to be full auto really just be loose stools is it continuous is it intermittent is the cyclical or does it alternate between diarrhea and constipation usually diarrhea loose stools is an underlying sign of an infection inflammation in allergy you so if it's continuous think of either chronic inflammation some type of inflammatory bowel problem or a bacterial infection if it's intermittent which means it only happens once in a while it's likely related to some type of food intolerance if it's cyclical okay so maybe it occurs every 7 to 10 days or every 14 to 10 do it 14 to 21 days maybe it only hangs around for about three days and the stools firm up and then it cycles back usually highly suspicious of a parasitic infection whether that's Giardia Cryptosporidium entamoeba histolytica some type of parasite okay alternating diarrhea and constipation that gets a little more tricky certainly could be an infection chronic inflammation could also play a role you could also be dealing with stool impaction I had a case many years ago of a child who had severe constipation but it appeared like he was having loose stools because periodically you would have this loose stools emerge until an x-ray was done and actually found that he had a softball-sized fecal plug in the lower bowel so what's happening was was he was leaking stool around the fecal plug and it wasn't until we got the fecal plug out that his bowel started to normalize some kids unfortunately have persistent ongoing bowel problems where they really need to be scoped they need a diagnostic workup from a pediatric gastroenterologist a specialist to evaluate what the heck is going on and this generally requires ended osku pee to look down the esophagus into the stomach as well as a colonoscopy to look at the large intestine and in some kids doing what's called a PillCam evaluation where the camera the size of a pill capsule is deposited into the upper testin and then it moves its way through the bowel child wears a belt that that receives the images from the camera and that helps to identify more insidious problems occurring in the small bowel and that's something that dr. Craig's Minh does Craig's Minh is a pediatric gastroenterologist in Texas who is an expert at doing thorough GI evaluation gastrointestinal evaluation for kids on the spectrum so a couple things just to consider there with respects to diarrhea oh by the way let me just go back real quickly in when you're talking about parasitic infections and this is not a particular a specific talk on parasites but two very common medications that are that have a cross ability of covering different parasites one is flagyl flagyl you've probably heard of with respects to Clostridium bacterial treatment another is called Alinea both are confound at most compounding of excuse me most pharmacies Alinea is still in a patent I do not believe it can be compounded flagyl can Alinea is very specific for Giardia very specific for Cryptosporidium flagyl is also very good for amoebic parasites not so good for Cryptosporidium does pretty well for Giardia does a good job for bacteria such as clostridia flagyl is going to be much cheaper much more readily available much more ability to get it covered through insurance Alinea not so much it's not used as much but aleni is a very good pair up antibiotic specifically for Giardia and Cryptosporidium but it's more expensive so you know a couple options if this comes up for you if you've got a test you've got suspicion you've got questions on these types of things this is where you can actually reach me through my autism action plan com website through the parent forum you can post me these questions there and I'll be happy to go through a lot more of this information with you in greater detail let's switch our gears to anxiety another huge problem with kids on the spectrum it's not an easy condition to treat there are a number of natural remedies that may be helpful and I say maybe because they're not universally helpful unfortunately and usually it's not just one remedy sometimes it's a number of these things in combination I can't give you a specific amount based on age or weight again with these supplements they're really dosed I'm really on need so you have to start somewhere and then adjust it as you go gaba is a calming neurotransmitter in the brain it has been helpful for some conditions with respect to anxiety anywhere between 500 to 5,000 milligrams usually in my practice about you know 2 to 3 thousand milligrams per day does a good job some kids need a higher amount and again it's not universally helpful but it is a pretty darn good first start if you're looking for a supplement to help with anxiety theanine is an X is an extract of green tea theanine at you know hundred milligrams to 400 milligrams per day works pretty well in association with GABA inositol powder is an interesting supplement comes events from new beginnings about 700 milligrams per dose comes as a powder it's easy to mix in water easy to mix and dilute juice it actually has been studied with respects to obsessive-compulsive disorder it's been an effective treatment for anxiety in association with gaba and i've also found it to be selectively helpful for some states of with respect to obsessive compulsive behavior again not universally but it's something to consider magnesium has a role in anxiety it doesn't work by itself as well as gaba specifically for anxiety 5htp has some usefulness to 5htp is a supplement that actually is a precursor to serotonin again not a specific dose based on age or weight you know one to two capsules a couple times a day is not a bad place to start you have to be cautious though something to talk over with your physician if your child is taking what's called an SSRI medication a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prozac Zoloft paxil you need to be cautious with 5htp because you may just drive too much serotonin which is not a good thing a couple of the things that I've actually had some good success with with respect to anxiety particularly social anxiety generalized anxiety is oxytocin I actually have entire presentations that go into oxytocin much more in-depth the nasal spray is not a bad option most of the compounding pharmacies carry at Hopewell Park pharmacy wellness least cells be the nasal spray works mostly pretty good for older kids for smaller kids they're not too happy with a nasal spray this is where an oxytocin tablet is going to be a little bit more effective again the dosing isn't based on age or weight so much as just a starting point if I'm using a tablet I'll generally start with a 5 unit tablet and I'll give it a couple times a day and then if I can do a nasal spray I may use the nasal spray as a as a in another emergency but as the therapy you might use in limited circumstances because it has a pretty quick onset let's say a child has a problem going to the mall or going to a restaurant but they get real anxious many times using a nasal spray in the moment can help decrease anxiety very quickly and you know it could be one to two sprays per nostril to get the job done so oxytocin has been a nice addition to biomedical intervention specifically with respect to generalized anxiety and social anxiety because the social part is that oxytocin in the brain helps to increase the facial recognition voice cue emotional recognition with people a couple of the things that have been helpful for anxiety one is respin a which I'll talk about shortly and then namenda onda Minda is actually a medication that's been used for Alzheimer's patients and it actually has been helpful for some cases with respects to anxiety respite a is a remedy that's been around now for about about four years I've been using my practice and it actually is a disc that's worn on the skin in that disc is a very small amount of something called brucer pain reser pain comes from the indian herb rural wall via a long time ago low wall via as a bulk herb was used for hypertension there was a study back in the mid 50's that used a liquid or or an herbal elixir an oral suspension of high-dose recipient ism and what they found was these kids had greatly improved socialization which environmental awareness less sensory issues across the board the problem was is they had some side effects to some of the kids became irritable because of it some of them had what probably was from low blood calcium where they got cramping and became agitated because reserpine is actually known to decrease blood calcium levels they're not the rest Binet but the or elixir researching can do that and so there's some special circumstances some of the kids over time became real emotional well they likely became that because what was happening was was the restore Pinos up regulating a specific enzyme called mao a an mao a is responsible for serotonin metabolism and over time if you're not replacing your stores of serotonin you can start to run a deficit and this can lead to irritability moodiness emotional instability let's fast forward and talk about respin a because respin a is low dose researching delivered through a disc it's not a high dose herbal oral elixir and so the side effects if they do occur are much more stable and much more low-key the benefits that have been observed with respects to RESPA may really fall into two major categories improvement in socialization where the kids are more engaged with the family more willing to participate more empathetic they're happier they many times just are overall improved in their mood and then in some kids they have more complex speech more deliberate and specific speech i haven't seen in a situation where a child went from being completely nonverbal to speaking but kids who at least had some language some words started to speak more side effects with respects to respin a hyperness very common with many different biomedical interventions nothing that's too extreme some kids have become irritable that's likely because of its influence on calcium moodiness emotional and depressed that's why when we use resume we make sure kids are getting enough protein or using supplements like 5htp or tryptophan for serotonin support I had one child that had increased stemming because of respin a but you know again that's that's not real common overall respin a has been a very favorable treatment it's something that you have to study it's something that you have to look into it's not a it's not a treatment that doesn't require some input on your part what I mean by that is it's not just about putting the disc on the skin and walking away putting the disc of respin a on your child's skin is easy but you also have to take some supportive supplements with it calcium needs to be taken at a certain amount we found out you know over time from the main researcher an innovator with respects to respin a elaine d lack that many times we have to modify other supplements modify the amount of essential fatty acids kids are getting vitamin D things like curcumin all can have an inhibiting effect on the effectiveness arrest but at least early on also b6 magnesium calcium as I mentioned and inositol are supportive supplements to rest Benes effectiveness so many times those have to be used to to help resume work more optimally so it takes a little bit of time to learn how to work with it a little bit of tweaking but overall it's been a very very encouraging treatment and something that I've used quite a bit and continue to use in my practice so if you want to learn more about respin a you can go to their website which is WWE and that's our es P and - a.com I also have a section on respin a in my autism action plan site as well okay what about gluten infraction what are some things to consider here what are some things to watch out for and this would also be for casein as well a couple things to have on hand if you know your child is extremely sensitive to gluten extremely sensitive to case in then I'll make sure I'd have some pepcid ac on hand you can get this over-the-counter this is only going to work by the way if it's if they if you can catch the infraction right away anywhere between a quarter to a half a tablet taken immediately after ingestion well many times nullify the negative reactions from gluten or casein epson salt cream as well as epson salt baths can be helpful this is something that can be done even if you didn't catch it immediately I wouldn't say days later but if within a couple hours putting add some salt cream on the skin um or doing an Epsom salt bath I learned from a parent a long time ago her child had an extreme sensitivity to gluten and whenever the child had an infraction she would put her child in the bathtub with about Oh about three to four inches of water and she would supersaturated that since salt you know use about four to five cups which is actually quite a bit in a small amount of water and should ever child sit in it and she swore by this that it helped to nullify the negative reactions that her child would have to gluten some kids skin is really sensitive I mean magnesium sulfate is a salt so you know it can be a little bit itchy and a little bit irritating so just you know be aware of that the things that are worthwhile I've had parents who carry around a bottle of Pepto side peptide is that Houston enzyme that is specific for gluten and casein digestion again you know this has to be an immediate this isn't something where they eat gluten and then you know six hours later you give a pep design it's not going to do anything some parents carry activated charcoal to help bind up the gluten casein right away immediately after exposure alka-seltzer gold can be used kind of similar principle as the pepcid ac essentially what you're trying to do is just neutralize the acids so that the peptides of the gluten encase and don't get broken down readily and then absorbed so a couple options there by the way if you're gonna do alka-seltzer gold it's got to be the it's got to be the gold it can't just be regular alka-seltzer so I think you know the probably the easiest thing to do is carry around an extra bottle of the peptide enzymes and if you know your child is really sensitive the pepcid ac is a good way to go okay hand flapping you know there's not one specific treatment for hand flopping and I realized that hand flapping can be situational okay it can just be a behavior that a child has because they're excited about something watching a video watching a TV show whatever it may be something that's just a situational but sometimes hand flapping has been associated with toxicity and sometimes dietary infractions ammonia is known to cause hand flapping ammonia for most kids on the spectrum is going to be generated by bacterial dysbiosis in the gut and protein mal digestion in the gut it's not always some type of internal biochemical urea cycle problem so a couple of things tickets with respects to that if you are suspicious that your child is hand flapping because primarily of bal toxicity it goes back to those bowel remedies activator charcoal to help bind up intestinal toxins once to twice a day whenever you do activated charcoal be cautious because activated charcoal can be a constipating agent so you need to work on things to prevent it i usually when i prescribed activated charcoal will also prescribe magnesium and again i'll use 250 to 500 ohms a day with activated charcoal used to try to prevent as best i can the constipation alpha q2 glute eric acid is a supplement that you can get from new beginnings it has been helpful in trying to helpful in reducing ammonia levels in the body whether they're coming internally for protein mal digestion or bacterial dysbiosis it's not universally helpful unfortunately but it is something to consider again percentage-wise for most kids their bacterial issue excuse me there ammonia issue is going to be gut related in in the vast majority of cases that I've seen so again look at constipation protein digestion problems you know even yeast overgrowth digestive enzymes working on the gut hyperactivity probably one of them the more troublesome things to try to try to figure out and help particularly from a supplement standpoint can be extremely difficult I mean quite challenging the first thing I think about with any kid who is hyperactive is diet so some type of food sensitivity whether it's to wheat soy dairy sugar intolerance you know what's their diet like with respect to sugar consumption juices sodas a biggie is artificial colors and flavors this is one of the first things I try to do is talk to parents respects to hyperactivity is really cleaning up their kids diets and the Feingold Institute you go to Feingold org grant website with regards to information with respects to food dyes and flavoring sensitivities that can trigger things like hyperactivity and it also talks about this this the the link between what are called salicylates and phenols so if you have a hyperactive child nothing else seems to be working you're doing gluten casein free you're doing supplements try to get them off of the the ritalin type medications please please please look at artificial colorings and flavorings the salicylates and the phenol connection through the Feingold Institute a couple of the things that you know can lead to hyperactivity or exacerbate hyperactivity a lack of nutrients so lack of B vitamins a lack of essential fatty acids this is one reason that cholera oil has been around for so long as part of a supplement in many of the introductory supplement programs for kids on the spectrum lack of antioxidants yeast overgrowth some kids are hyper because of yeast not all the time not every kid with yeast is hyperactive and but think of it okay this is why I always recommend doing the organic acid test from Great Planes because it gives you a good insight into yeast and bacterial toxins other metabolic imbalances but it really specifically helps to identify yeast which is such a problem again going back to a lack of nutrients new beginnings Nutritionals has something called a starter packet which includes B vitamins includes essential fatty acids through cod liver oil includes antioxidants a nice place to start some additional things that have been helpful for some kids hyperactivity I wish they were universally helpful but not always the linic acid can be a helpful adjunctive supplement on to kids programs you know usually about 800 milligram excuse me 800 micrograms per day not a bad place to start pycnogenol has had some usefulness in some cases pycnogenol is not one of the first things I think about when I think about hyperactivity taurine can be helpful in association with the linic acid again there's not a specific amount based on age or weight but it's been useful methyl b12 therapy it's interesting some kids actually who are hyperactive do really well with methyl b12 even though one of the most common side effects of methyl b12 therapy whether it's nasal injection oral or the lollipop is hyperactivity but many times what you'll find is there can be slight elevation hyperactivity for a period of time then in the hyperactivity can actually diminish and then you start to see an emergence of eye contact and awareness and sometimes language so methyl b12 therapy is an option Epsom salt bath Epsom salt cream which you talked about earlier with respect to the gluten infractions has been helpful to with respects to hyperactivity and then of course looking at the phenol issue is really really important so I can't give you an exact protocol of you know you know do all ten of these supplements and this for every particular child because it's very individualized but I don't know what I really want you to get a you'll come away with from this particular discussion about hyperactivity is looking at food looking at the diet specifically with respects to the the phenols and the salicylates treatment wise and we can have an entire discussion here you know about Ritalin type medication an interesting remedy which doesn't get a lot of play and doesn't get a lot of interest from parents and and from doctors too is something called the nicotine patch but I wanted to point it out to you just so you knew about it the nicotine patch idea was proposed by doctor Bradstreet number of years ago and what has been found with respects to understanding the biochemistry of nicotine is that its primary mode of activity is that it stimulates thing is called the nicotine receptors which helps control the production of acetylcholine acetylcholine is a part of what's called our cholinergic nervous system it modulates other chemicals in the brain specifically with respects to attention to memory to the speed of mental processing to just an overall improvement in cognitive function and it's also been helpful at reducing hyperactivity in some kids so let's uh let's look at a little bit closer what was being used and what has been used is purchasing a 7 milligram nicotine patch and again this is something that you've considered this is something that I highly encourage people to talk over with their doctor about but we're not using an entire cell 7 milligram patch you're generally only using a quarter to a half of a seven milligram patch one patch is equivalent to 0.15 milligrams of nicotine being delivered per hour a common cigarette provides anywhere between two to three milligrams of nicotine so we're talking about very very low amounts of nicotine applied through the skin over a 24-hour period of time so it's a very low amount delivered in a continuous way to try to stimulate these nicotine receptors and it's been helpful at reducing hyperactivity and some kids as well as focusing issues some kids get some sleep disturbance from it if that's the case the patch can be worn for less period of time maybe 14 to 16 hours a day so it's an interesting remedy that's been helpful for some kids with respects to hyperactivity now and again it could be considered an alternative potentially to the common medications would this be the first thing I would reach for of course not I would be looking at food sensitivities yeast issues nutritional imbalances phenyl salicylate sensitivities I'd go through that entire list first to see if we could get some inroads with respects to hyperactivity before I would even consider her something like a nicotine patch and I would encourage you do the same thing here to Bill we're also now falling into that group of the discussion with respects to aggression a couple things that want you to be aware of in thinking about your child's mood is it continuous or is it intermittent is it situational is it potentially or is it age-appropriate situational what could be some situations that could generate behavioural problems is it only occurring at school if it is occurring at school when is it occurring is it occurring around lunchtime is it occurring after lunchtime maybe it's something to do with their food could it be low blood sugar is there some new kid in class that's bugging them is it occurring with neighbors is it occurring with an aide so one thing is not every problem is related to a medical issue it could just be an environmental problem is it age-appropriate this is gets hard honestly because you can have a six-year-old child on the spectrum who behaves more like a four-year-old so by age they're older but by developmental age they're not so unless you have another child in the family that you can reference things to sometimes it's hard to know but sometimes kids act out behaviorally because of their age of the old terrible two scenario sibling rivalry even though you may have a child on the spectrum that doesn't mean that they're always going to get along with your brother and sister so it doesn't mean necessarily that there's a medical problem it could just be that their brother or sisters bugging them I mean I see it within my family with my my daughter and my son you know sometimes they're gonna fight so that can happen so again can be again diet okay artificial colors flavors he salicylates these phenols found in chemicals I could take this conversation back you know with respect to that to what we just talked about with respects to hyperactivity the same thing B vitamins essential fatty acids antioxidants he's Grover growth but more commonly irritability moodiness Tantrums if it's going to be tied to some kind of biotoxin it's going to be tied more specifically to a bacterial worms may be an issue particularly if you see it around the full moon that's certainly a possibility but more often than not a moody irritable tantrum a type behavior is more bacterial based than it is yeast based so therapies you got to do some investigation and we can start to look at you know things like testing like the organic acid test etc a couple of the things what I've tied into here with respects to irritability and tantrums is would fall into the category of anxiety so many kids who are anxious when they're overly anxious will become irritable and may tantrum okay they can't necessarily tell you but that's what's going on so this then references us back to what are some things that are usable you useful for anxiety the thinning the gaba the inositol they may be helpful aggression again hyperactivity anxiety irritability agitation moodiness now we have aggression same thing is it continuous is it or a mittened is it situational is it happening at school is it happening with neighbors is it happening with an aide it's not always a problem medical wise quick story years ago I had a patient and this is actually a case that I present in my autism the road to recovery book was a boy severely autistic who did you know very well on dietary intervention really really bad behaviors but that what happened was was there was a point in time in treating him where he started to develop a behavior where he would come home from school and 2 hours or whatever was after school he would tantrum so much that he would essentially destroy his bedroom and just you know and essentially go through the home and tip things over throw things and just was out of his mind what we finally found out and what what came of this through the pattern is that it was only occurring Monday through Friday wasn't happening on the weekends well it turns out that what he was having was he was having low blood sugar he was hypoglycemic he wasn't eating his snack at school and he only sporadically ate his lunch so what was happening is when he came home from not having eating his lunch and not having eaten a snack was he was hungry he couldn't tell his mom he is hungry he just lost it and he would tantrum and tantrum until you know finally at some point he ate something interesting is that it wasn't occurring on the weekends because he wasn't in school it was remedied by making sure his teachers knew that he ate if he had to eat something he had to eat his food and then also he need to eat a little something before he headed home and once that was the case no more tantrums same thing here though ok from a biomedical standpoint diet think about diet diet diet is there some type of problem particularly the sensitivity to the phenols and the salicylates allergies is it a possible food allergy or environmental allergy I've had kids who've left their home they go on vacation they do finally come back to their home and they start getting aggressive and irritable could be mold damage not real common but it's something that does happen the other thing you absolutely want to Lou lout and work on and remedy is constipation I've seen more kids develop acute problems with aggression when they become constipated so that whole discussion we had early on about constipation one of the reasons I also recommend doing the organic acid test from Great Planes laboratory is to rule out Clostridium bacteria Clostridium bacteria there's a bunch of these bacteria they produce some of them produce a marker called HP HP a HP HP a will affect dopamine when dopamine becomes erratic it causes erratic behavior and this I've seen this over and over and over again on my practice really really important to assess and to consider there's a wide variety of treatments for Clostridium problems everything from culturelle to sacrum Isis Velarde to the use of flagyl to the use of vancomycin they're very individualized but these these can be effective some kids do okay just on culture well others need antibiotics that's that's the reality comparing flagyl and vancomycin as a treatment flagyl again is going to be more readily available it's going to be cheaper it's also going to have cross coverage too parasitic infections - vancomycin is a very good antibiotic very good against clostridia but it's going to be more expensive and not readily as readily paid for via insurance one thing to consider with respects to cluster T of treatment neither of these antibiotics whether it's flagyl Alinea or vancomycin treat the spores of clostridia cluster t is a spore-forming bacteria this is where you need things more like high dose probiotics taken long term like culturelle or another probiotic like VSL 3 or from custom probiotics the the D lactate free these are the things that are going to help suppress cluster attea long term again more this is more of a discussion we have time for tonight again you can visit me if you'd like for more detailed questions on the the parent forum through the action the autism action plan com website a couple other things to consider with respects to aggression again constipation gut inflammation this is why so many kids have responded well to something like the specific carbohydrate diet is because the sed diet helps to decrease gut inflammation the low oxalate diet or an oxalate issue is another consideration something that you can actually pick up on from the organic acid test as you look at the oxalic acid marker there's a great website Lowe oxalate info oxalates are organic compounds of any mat fan and many different types of foods actually healthy foods that many of us eat but some individuals absorb oxalates to a to a to high degree in many individuals and severe cases it can lead to kidney stones typically what's happening with kids in the spectrum is we're getting an accumulation of oxalates they excrete them through the urine it can cause painful urination but it creates pain and inflammation throughout the body which can impact the brain adversely and we can see aggressive and behavior irritability etc from an oxalate issue bsl-3 high-dose probiotic helps to break down oxalates magnesium and calcium citrate the the situated forms of calcium magnesium are needed to be taken with meals to help bind those oxalates in the gut and then allow them to be excreted the low oxalate dot info site is in depth get much more information there if you detect oxalates on your child's organic acid test or if there's a family history you know that you know of oxalate kidney stones it's always a possibility so the oxalate story is another component another dietary intervention that can be helpful something i think about particularly with kids with just they're irritable all the time they're constantly on edge I think about off the problems also individuals with fibromyalgia certainly it has been associated that oxalates could be a problem with them as well okay what about sleep problems this is one of the first questions that I ask parents is how well is their child sleeping because if a child is not sleeping generally the parents are not sleeping and everyone is tired and everyone is miserable so the lack of sleep is really a high priority of things to try to correct dietary infractions can be a problem again you have to look and say is it because of something a child might be eating is it because of peptides is it because of the gluten soy or dairy is it because of a food allergy is because of too much sugar not eat enough complex carbohydrates and protein but just eating a bunch of simple sugar you know in your bedtime you know cakes and cookies and jell-o's and muffins where they're having a blood sugar problem those are some things to from a dietary standpoint that might be a link that's not a link you may be looking at some you know checking a blood level for iron or ferritin would be a good thing to do some of the things that can contribute to sleeping issues B vitamins in the evening you know b6 for example can be overstimulating for some kids I had one child years ago actually have a sensitivity to a zinc supplement that they're taking a couple other things too much activity before bed many kids these days don't have a bedtime routine so you know it's just expected that they're gonna go to bed and fall asleep well kids on the spectrum are very sensitive to electromagnetics they're very expensive to frequencies they're very sensitive to sensory input so TV video games DVDs tronics will over stimulate their brains a nervous system and one thing that i found and i think it's true of all kids but it's it's something to be aware of with kids in the spectrum even though they may appear that they're not watching TV or not paying attention they are they're very aware and they're also very sensitive and innocent and I think you know because they many kids can't talk and they can't express to you how they feel they can't always express a nightmare they they may not be able to express some type of excitable image that they saw something disturbing and you know honestly TV these days for the most part is is awful with respects to the types of images that are flown forth into our homes particularly in front of our kids and it's a very difficult thing to control so we have to think of that that may be something that's happening you know is so creating a routine turning out the TV turning out the videos turning out the DVDs and creating a routine for bedtime some parents not all but I found in certain circumstances actually had full-spectrum lights in the house full-spectrum bulbs will suppress melatonin so we need to turn off those off also a change in the seasons in the summertime you can expect your kids to stay awake longer there's a natural tendency for kids just to stay up longer during the summer couple other things to consider with respects to sleep assess the pattern do they have a difficult time falling asleep are they waking up at night are they waking up at night giggling goofy so stimulatory behavior if they're waking up giddy goofy and silly think yeast could be a phenol sensitivity to but think yeast if they wake up irritable and agitated oftentimes it's a food sensitivity many times it's a bacterial problem in those cases unfortunately it could be a nightmare but I wouldn't expect a nightmare to be going on every night so usually that goofy giddiness the silliness is definitely yeast though if we have a difficult time falling asleep many times melatonin can be helpful melatonin between 1/2 to 3 milligrams 30 minutes before bed can help kids get too young be helped melatonin can be you obtained for many supplement companies like new beginnings sometimes magnesium in the evening can be helpful and some salt baths in the evening can be helpful I've had a few parents you know have some luck with some of the herbal teas like chamomile passionflower given before bedtime as well routine as I mentioned before establishing a routine you know turning the TV off taking a bath you know getting them a bed getting them prepared to go to bed as best you can a couple other things with respects to sleep 5htp and tryptophan another 5htp and tryptophan are the precursors to serotonin i generally if I'm going to use either one I will start with 5htp and 1 to 4 capsules 30 to 90 minutes before bed can be helpful for some sleeping issues sometimes we have to use tryptophan although I don't use it that often as I mentioned before melatonin is not a bad place to start the melatonin that you would get from your beginnings is going to be more of a quick-acting sometimes we need to use more of a time-release melatonin and where we can use a quick-acting melatonin to get to sleep in a time-release military stay asleep the difficulty is with the time-release melatonin is a difficult thing to give and use and to have it be effective if your child cannot swallow a tablet or capsule excuse me a tablet or capsule if the time release has to be broken up and mixed in food and for the most part it's not a time-release tablet anymore but if you do have a situation where your where your child can swallow a tablet or capsule then that time release melatonin is a nice option sometimes just a short-acting is all you need and sometimes if kids still wake up in the middle of night giving another dose of a short-acting helps them to get back to sleep I've not found melatonin to be toxic matter of fact melatonin is an antioxidant in the brain so it has a lot of usefulness do we want to use it long-term would it be great not to use it at all certainly would it be ideal not to use it long-term well I think any of these supplements particularly a hormone would be ideal not to use long term so we try to do the best we can to get kids sleeping but if they're not sleeping and the only thing that works is melatonin then in my personal opinion it's a worthwhile thing to use because the lack of sleep is devastating you can actually obtain time release in short-acting melatonin through this web link here at Emerson ecologic s-- there's a doctor code called sunset and a zip code of nine to five nine one that actually need to be used to order the time release and the short-acting melatonin and actually in doing so through that link there's a 10% discount on on the supplements through that Emerson ecologic so again this information by the way look at the presentations being recorded will be on great plains website for a couple weeks but there's also another recording that you can obtain right away through the autism seminars on demand and if you want to get a copy of those of the slides then you can do so through the autism seminars on demand as well and just download the slides so stimulatory behavior well there's a lot of things that can lead to that first couple things I think of any recent illness cold flu or allergies all known to access to be yeast is there a dietary infraction gluten casein soy other allergens food dyes could this be a contributing factor to stemming then I start looking at other factors that might contribute to to self-stimulatory behavior is it worse or an onset after a particular situation is it happening at school is it happening from something they're doing in the community okay swimming for example in the summer the chlorine maybe in quotes in quotes a potential problem a glutton fraction that you don't know about I don't want to throw grandma and grandpa under the bus but the reality is is some family members don't get it you know all kids deserve milk and cookies you know that's the perception anyway of some people so you think do some detective work a couple other things is the stemming worse at a particular time of the year is it really only is it getting worse in the winter or maybe there's more propensity to illness or in the spring where it could be tied to allergies a new supplement that was added maybe it's a lack of supplements you know where they need something more sometimes you have to work this out you know with with your doctor to kind of to kind of figure things out the problem is is the list for things that can contribute to self-stimulatory behavior or huge it's not just one thing unfortunately and I have found all of these things on this page to be useful for some kids at certain circumstances cod liver oil has been a wonderful therapy for visual stemming sigh glancing for example with some kids treating yeast has helped many kids with respects to self-stimulatory behavior but I've had kids who had so stimulatory behavior work olive-oil did nothing and treating yeast didn't stop it but respin a helped or doing a combination of gaba and lithium seemed to to make the difference because in in those particular situations the cell similar behavior was also in association with a child being irritable and agitated so I wish I could give you an exact breakdown of you know do these five things and it's going to help every time it's just not the reality this is why we have so many different things that we can use and in many cases they work quite well but sometimes we have to keep searching and searching for other things that are available that may be helpful this is why understanding what to do clinically and working with a doctor who understands the the the subtle nuances of problems is important so a couple things for my observation self-stimulatory behavior is generally worse with anxiety it's worse with repeated exposure to the television set to video games most it's worse with kids being indoors a lot and I see that happening with a lot of kids on the spectrum they're in therapy sessions all day long where they don't get outside much why is that happening is it because of the excessive electromagnetic radiation that they're exposed to maybe it may just be because of they're not getting enough exercise so not getting enough exercise not getting enough outdoor activity running swimming being in nature many times will just increase the problem with self-stimulatory behavior that might be a simplistic viewpoint for some kids I mean I get it there's some kids that are impervious to no matter what you do with respects to trying to help their self-stimulatory behavior but these are things that I've seen we ran over my practice throughout the years and then finally what about regression well the reality is is that you have to go through the the you have to go through that list of all the usual suspects is there a dietary infraction do you have a do you have a history with your child to being a strong reactor to gluten casein could it be yeast and bacterial overgrowth even if you did a test three months ago that showed nothing doesn't mean they couldn't have picks up picked up something new or had an overgrowth occur because of a of a weakened state of immunity in that moment is it a new infection is it tied to some type of seasonal change again situational changes that may be occurring at school a detox reaction die-off certainly is something that can cause regression so is it a new therapy that you've just started are you treating yeast are you giving something for detox are you doing chelation therapy think back you know as to what maybe is going on recently could it just be an age transition kids develop and kids go through brain development at certain times that could cause emotional changes and we know about we know that about kids and teenagers you know there's a transition point around 10 to 12 years old we're you know kids become combative and they talk back and they're constantly saying no you know these same types of changes are happening with kids on the spectrum so it may be it could be an age transition issue too so some final comments okay I always encourage people to journal you don't have to write an obscene amount of information on a daily basis but but keeping a journal that you can take your observing with your child keep a spreadsheet of therapies it could even just be a calendar notebook that you write down in your notebook and your calendar when you started a therapy and then keep some notes under what you're seeing it's also important to note when you stopped a therapy so that you could share that with your doctor try to recognize patterns okay situational seasonal time of the day all of that is is useful and then looking to say well you know what new therapies have been added what's been seen are we seeing any positives any negatives no changes because a lot of times I'll find that if I it if I find that a child's reacting to something I'll usually start backtracking and what was just added recently this is why I often don't like to start 5 or 6 things at the same time so if I'm going to start a group of supplements then I'll usually have the parents introduce one new supplement every 24 to 48 hours so that we have a little bit of a lag to see what kind of reaction they're going to have so the reality is is you have to become a detective with respects to your child's particular autism condition and there's a lot of great resources out there these webinars I know are helpful for many people a lot of other great books and conferences to go to a lot of online sites a lot of parent chat rooms as well and then you know hopefully you know if in time and if it's something that you find useful this is why I created the autism action plan comm site was to be there for parents and caregivers to answer questions to try ideas about things that I have seen from my experience even if you're working with a doctor the reality is you can't always get a hold of them you can't always get an appointment and this is why I answer questions on the weekends in the evenings on holidays it's just it's an avenue for people to go to who want to have access to a medical professional okay so with that said I hope this information was helpful for you and again this particular presentation can be found through the autism action plans comm site as well as the autism seminars on-demand website again it's going to be it has been recorded will be on Great Plains as web site for a couple weeks I'm also available for private consultations I have office I see patients in Southern California occasionally in normal well as having just established some office hours in Oregon in Bend Oregon which is in Central Oregon so if you're from the Pacific Northwest you can certainly contact me if you go to dr. roller comm that's my central website you can access my office information through that website if you want to get more information about me my consultation services and just an FYI parents who are members of the autism action plan comm site actually receive discounts on consultations through my practice whether that's office phone or Skype okay so just some general information for you again I hope this information was helpful for you I realize there's a ton of stuff to consider a ton of different scenarios to consider but at least you can hopefully walk away tonight with some some useful tips that you can start applying care of your child and I hope everybody has a great holiday however you celebrate it I hope this holiday season is a happy and joyous one for you and your family and we will be back in leave the second week of January for the start of our 2013 webinar series okay good night everybody take care", "xb1mM5xyedo": "today is really about helping you understand what safe script is why it's there and how best to get the the benefits from it the the whole idea of safe script I suppose I can remember seeing a presentation quite a few years ago and Heath Ledger's dad was was one of the speakers and it really hit home why this is so important because he talked about his son of course who died from a multiple episode with using using a cocktail of drugs and most of them were prescription drugs I believe and he talked about how important it was and how incredibly different it would have been an outcome for his son had there been something like safe script around and and I suppose ironically Heath was in a movie called candy I don't know whether it did anybody see candy was it was a if you haven't seen it I suggest you do it was a brilliant movie and that was that book was written by a guy called Luke Davies and I didn't realize this but Luke Davies actually wrote that book and it was it was really autobiographical he he was actually heavily involved in in using opioid drugs he was a drug user himself and he went on to his won an Academy Award and done some incredible things with with other movies as well but I'd gone off into a tangent already about anyway I seriously think that that's a it's a it's a brilliant movie brilliant movie to watch but the reason I mentioned it is because it sort of helped me understand that this this isn't really as much about us as doctors and pharmacists as it is about our patients and trying to keep them safe so it it rolled out safe script last year in the Western phn and the data was being collected probably for about six months before then the other important dates are the the fact that last month so by the end of April it was of available and rolled out for the rest of the state and and the really important date to remember and I'm sure oh maybe not not sure but I think maybe that's why you could be here tonight is April next year it's going to be mandatory so everybody will have to use so script if you're prescribing or if you're dispensing so the first question we need to explore is which drugs are going to be involved and there's a there's a a list of of the groups and and some of the specific drugs and the important thing is that every time we prescribe or dispense one of these drugs that will automatically be fed into the safe script repository and then will be available for other people too to see the reason the list contains this this set of drugs is because when it was when it was looked at I think it was the Austin that was given the the task of a steering committee at the Austin at the task of working out which drugs should be in it they looked at the data that was supplied by the coroner and specifically we're looking at safety and the drugs involved in overdose deaths and that's why this is the list we've got so that there's certainly probably a couple of other drugs that could be included in this list that you may think will we you know we we do see some hazardous use with them but they weren't necessarily the drugs that came out when when we looked at the drugs that were actually causing the overdose deaths so I speak specifically I suppose about drugs like tramadol and pregabalin which aren't on this list but the ones that are everything that's in the safe at my pharmacy so all of the S eights and the benzos the Z drugs quetiapine and and every drug that contains codeine which is a big shift because it was not that long ago that I was selling missing dole over-the-counter now if you even prescribed miss in dole that's going to show up on save script even at even a low dose of codeine so that was number one important point about what's in it number two important point is for everybody to understand that safe script does not tell you whether you can or can't prescribe nor does it tell you whether you can or can't dispense it is merely a tool to help you to make that clinical decision so I was talking to a patient a few weeks ago if you said to me that their doctor had a look at safe script and safe script said oh you know I don't know whether they called it so script but said that they've got this new online tool and and it told them that they weren't allowed to prescribe this medicine for them so you know maybe he or she was using that as a as a little bit of a defense tool or a way of getting out of an you know an event of prescribing but the reality is that it doesn't stop you even even if it may give you a notification and we'll talk about what notifications are in a sec it merely changes the situation where in the past we may have prescribed or dispensed effectively with the blindfold on only knowing what's on our computer what our history says what a patient's told us what what my dispensed computer might say maybe a couple of phone calls but it's it's certainly not comprehensive and what's changed now is that we have that comprehensive history one of the one of the issues especially early on is that I don't think that patients necessarily understand it I mean a lot of doctors and pharmacists still haven't really grappled with it enough to fully understand it but patients certainly lots of them don't know exactly what it's going to mean so I've been presented with situations already where I've gone out to talk to a patient I had a look at their history and I've had information that I didn't have before which altered the way that I wanted to to then go forward but the first thing I needed to do was describe to the patient how I got that information because their reaction was how do you know and I think we have to especially at the start when not everybody is is accessing it yet so that patients may go to some pharmacies or clinics and not be quizzed as much as they may when you're having a look at all that information so I think it's really important that we prep patients with what it is that we're actually doing you know maybe some patients sort of think well you know is that legal I haven't given my consent and as we all know or if you don't you do now that this overrides any any privacy issue that may be there it Paul will describe it in better terms of it later but where we don't have to seek any approval to use safe script from the patient it's information that is there for their safety this isn't really easy to see on the on the screen but you've got it in your in your little package but it really just shows you diagrammatically what happens in the in the process now when with the evolution of safe script and it was pointed out to me for the first time at our last presentation that there is probably one arrow missing because the information that feeds to the doctor the first rectangle probably needs to feed the other way as well because the doctors script is also going into into the into the safe script attachment so basically a patient will visit the doctor as they as they usually do the doctor will prescribe to have a consultation decide to possibly prescribe a medicine get that up on to their prescribing software now this is where it's going to alter a little bit depending on what stage you're at because if you have the latest version of your prescribing software then you'll you'll you'll get information that that comes in the form of a notification sent directly to your screen as a pop-up without you having to separately log into safe script so it's going to be much easier you may say but no that doesn't happen with my annamaria by the way how many people have already had a bit of a play and are already registered with safe script in the room probably about half which is great but for those that aren't as acquainted there'll be there'll be more description of what I'm talking about with the notifications and alerts in a minute but if if you are on the latest version of your prescribing software you'll get a notification which will come into effect before you press the last button before you press print so you'll be able to make your decision as to whether you still want to prescribe that drug maybe that strength those directions if you want to alter something before you get to the point of actually prescribing it which is obviously the way it should be and beneficial and in the same way we we also have that on our dispensing software so that before we get to the end I think it's the penultimate key we hit we'll get a notification if that's required so that information feeds in the doctor prescribes the patient ends up with a prescription the prescription comes to the pharmacy the the script is then scanned or entered manually again at that penultimate stage I'll get a notification if there's an issue with safe script and we'll run through what those issues are in a sec if I if I go ahead and dispense it that information will then be transmitted into safe script only doctors and pharmacists can put information into safe script and the Department of Health all obviously has access and can oversee what's happening as well you can't directly go into safe script and change anything the only way things get changed in safe script or added or subtracted is through your software or my software when there's a prescribing or a dispensing event if you prescribe something and then you cancel it it'll come up cancelled on this if you prescribe it give it to the patient cancel it after they leave which I hope doesn't happen very often but if you did then I'd scan it at my pharmacy or into it and it would come up as a cancelled script so I'd see that I could still again I could probably override that in and dispense it manually but I would get a notification that that's a canceled script now we're going to have a little bit of a system demonstration so for people that have already logged on they'll be familiar with this this screen that's going to pop up now if if the system is is incorporated into your dispense as it is with with pharmacy or your prescribing software then when one of those drugs is either prescribed or dispensed and a notification comes up automatically if you hit on that notification then it will take you straight into this field provided you've logged in if you haven't logged in then you'll have to login and logging in is similar to the process that you do with your bank where you'll get a number sent to your phone a password that you'll then need to put into the field that'll take you into safe script which will then ask you for another quick password which can be your personal password that you use continuously you don't have to change that so that can be a really simple password that you use every day and that one will will jump you straight into this field might sound a bit complicated it's actually very easy and and when you it's it's it's it's best described as opposed by just doing it yourself and it becomes quite intuitive so we're now into our our safe script screen if we went via that notification then these fields would already be populated if on the other hand we're going into it without going through a notification we then have to populate with first name surname and in date of birth so what's changed for pharmacist is that now your your pharmacist will be aware that the date of birth is popping up on all scripts for for for certainly for these drugs on the list which in the past wasn't there I mean your medical software always had date of birth we didn't always have that entered so that's changed so we're now hit return our patient comes up we hit on April Adams down below and what and so what opens up is is her whole history as of probably something like a year ago first of July last year okay so just undone now that that screen is almost identical for a doctor or a pharmacist logging in with the exception of the permit and correspondence so that's the only difference is those two tiles and missing on the pharmacist screen and that is because obviously we're not going to be issuing permits and we we also don't have any correspondence from DHS about permits or patients so other than that the screens are identical there are a couple of filters a drug search and events which just means that we can simplify these entries by just looking at the prescribed events so just the the three prescribed all we can jump on to dispensed and again we'll just see the dispensed events we can filter by a date range or we can look at drug classes if you want although I find that usually the one I'm using most often is really just when you drop down all events and you either look at prescribed or dispensed events and that can simplify the the screen for you so if you hit on one of those lines it then will open up with more information about the in this case it's a prescribing event so it will give you more information about what's happened it'll tell you the the clinic the name of the doctor possibly some this is just a test one but possibly contact details if we close that down and open up one of the dispenser vents it'll give us again information about the the pharmacist and which pharmacist it was where the pharmacy was and who the prescriber rose if we have that information and that's kind of presents another important point which is sometimes the information that a prescriber will see when they write a prescription is going to be different to what I see when it arrives at the pharmacy to dispense it so it might have been appropriate to write at the time whereas once by the time it comes to me there might be a couple of other dispense events that the doctor didn't see when that was written which may make my decision to dispense or not different it might it might mean that it's unsafe so you might find a situation where it's been written perfectly valid everything's fine it comes to me and I decline to dispense it and then the action I take is going to be dependent on lots of things and we can go into that if you like so stage supply certainly in directions you'll you'll find the directions that have been typed in onto the label by the pharmacist yeah so that's an initial overview of course the the sorts of things we're looking at that the dates it was prescribed dispensed the quantities has has it been presented has scripts were and presented at a lot of different pharmacies are there multiple prescribers and they're the sorts of things that are going to help us and inform us to make a decision as to what is going to be appropriate prescribing or dispensing also because you know I think some people's notes or what they call a note can be one line other people like to get a little bit colorful with their notes and their note could be two pages so and then the onus would be on you to read all of those notes okay now I've talked about notifications this is an overview of what a notification is a notification is that message that pops up on your Green every time you dispense one of or prescribe one of those drugs that's on the list that we saw earlier so each time you'll get either a green notification it'll pop up on your screen and a green notification tells us that there's really nothing to see in this history that would alarm us or would tell us that there's there's an unsafe event in the history it doesn't mean you can't go into safe script and have a look at a patient's history but but it's it's gone through its algorithm and it's saying that we don't think that there's any problem that may be because there hasn't been in the last six months the dispensing of any of these drugs or it may be because there was only a single prescriber and there's no other reason for an alert that it's not a high dose so you'll get a green notification if on the other hand you get either an Amber or a red notification so either of those two come April next year when when this is mandatory you must go into safe script and check why that notification has come up what the history is and and then make your decision as to whether it's still appropriate the amber obviously is a little bit less hazardous than the red and the amber will will pop up with a lower what what it does is it looks at the the opioid drugs and it categorizes or it converts the drugs into a morphine equivalent dose if that morphine equivalent dose falls between 50 and 100 milligrams on average over the past 90 days per day it will then give an amber alert if it's over 100 milligrams it'll give a red alert now there are a couple of other ways those alerts will pop up we you'll get a red alert where in prescriptions from four or more prescribers or four or more pharmacies have have been activated on safe script so that will give you a Red Alert the reason is because again just just looking at the coroner's data the coroner identified that when there was an overdose death typically often what was happening was there was there were patients that were seeing four or more prescribers or going to four or more pharmacies so it's as simple as that the other high-risk drug combination that this is going to monitor is where methadone or fentanyl is prescribed in combination with either benzos or other long-acting opioids and that will also every time pop up an alert so even for a patient that you have stable on on methadone who may also have a prescription for a benzo and they're the only two things that are in the history you will get a red alert that pops up on your screen so it doesn't mean that you can't continue to prescribe but it's just one of those categories that has seen to be quite high on the list of potential overdose deaths you", "gQc8yFZt5r0": "[Music] you guys it's princess people can of us see see I'm doing a Q&A today to answer questions that people might have about edibles top coal and tincture so yeah let's get into this this is trainwreck by the way in case anybody was wondering in an organic raw cone okay so one of the first questions I got was about topical balms how likely are topical bombs or how likely are the use of top polls to show up on a drug test not at all they shouldn't show at all they don't absorb into the bloodstream the same way that smoking or using edibles or teens sure does so topical balms should absolutely never never never get you high ever anyone who advertises it as something that gets you my it's not a I would question that so topical balms stuff like bath bombs body lotion trying to think of some of the stuff that I make sugar scrubs bath salts like actual bath salts not that crazy drug that makes you hallucinate and see [ __ ] and eat people anything like that anything that's like going on like a topical use of cannabis she should not absorb into your skin and shouldn't show up on a drug test this is especially beneficial for people who need the pain relieving aspects of cannabis but who work in a job maybe that even if you're in a legal district they can still deny you a job for testing positive for cannabis so that's one of the many problems of prohibition so yeah but bombs should never show up in a test so shouldn't have any worries about that the next question is a couple of questions so I'll answer them one at a time so I'll start with the topical question since the first one was a topical question - what's a good balm for joint pain in the knees any solidly done topical balm that includes cannabis should work I know with the one that I make it includes a blend of herbs other than just cannabis and it also includes essential oils and a few other things so a really good basic balm that you can make yourself without cannabis is a turmeric ginger and cayenne balm and it's really good if you don't want to use cannabis for whatever reason like if you are just totally against it like I said they don't show up in drug screenings so shouldn't really be too much of a concern but if you're concerned just shoot me a message and I'm more than happy to give you a recipe for a super basic balm that and cause cayenne ginger and turmeric but for the most part any quality topical balm and this is super controversial but I'll just say it anyway in my opinion a super quality topical ball includes the full spectrum of cannabinoids which includes THC I'm not hating on CBD bombs I think they're great for a specific purpose but I think when it comes to the long term of keeping the inflammation down and keeping the pain contained I think that including all the cannabinoids is best so in my opinion the best kind of topical balm is one that has all the cannabinoids including THC and CBD but some of that's just going to be trial and error if you're in a place like DC where it's legal but it's still not really being regulated so most anything you try is either shipped in from somewhere or made by somebody locally it's sort of hard to day like which one is best but I just know that when I made mine nobody else had Topco bombs at least that was around so I genuinely just made it for myself and it was pretty life-changing experience so and Ivan curbed on it since I first started making it so it's something you can definitely make for yourself it just takes practice and sort of knowing what herbs and spices and essential oils besides cannabis go well in a ball okay so next question can I catch a buzz with textures yes so here's the thing with textures there are a lot of people who swear their tincture will can get you high with like one drop I'm gonna I have tested many peoples tinctures including my own I have never gotten high from one drop not ever and if they're talking about if it's a fully thick sludge absolutely no alcohol left in it no Everclear extract no solvent left in it whatsoever then it's be Co not tincture and in that case a drop would probably get you pretty high depending on your tolerance but for a standard tincture you can't get high not from one drop I know for me it usually takes me about a third of an ounce to get high that's my goal from a tincture if I just really need to sleep or relax and so when I say the goal of getting high for me personally it's not recreational but for other people it is and that's fine I don't recreational or medical I don't really care either way but for me when I say trying to get high it means I'm trying to go to sleep I'm trying to have that full body relax I need the high feeling I know that in order to get me to where I'm trying to get I need to be high but but for the most part I don't really use tincture to get high i micro dose tincture so I use which I'll get to that and actually another question that I'm coming up but sort answer yes you can catch a bus from tincture but the side to that is that you need to know how to dose it if that's what you're trying to do so I'm gonna this person at a third question but I'm gonna go back and answer the other two questions first okay um two of these are by two different people one of them asked what's the average dosage of a tincture and then the other one asked yes what is the average doses so yeah okay so here's the thing for a tincture and really all sorts of cannabis so you really understand this dosing depends on the person 100% depends on the person depends on what you're trying to do and it depends on how quickly you need it to happen so for texture for example I use it daily as an assist for my anxiety and for chronic pain I only use three to five drops in my tea or coffee in the morning and then I use an additional three to five drops about two hours later in my smoothie that's what I do it's helped my anxiety some strains are better than others for that the ones that tend to help by anxiety don't tend to help pain so sometimes the one that I do in my tea is not the one that I do in my smoothie but that's considered like micro dosing so I'm Mike reducing the cannabinoids into my system it's not going to get me high it has never gotten me high the three to five drops anyway but it helps for sure with the anxiety and the pain management on not a flare-up day so dosing if you're trying to get high or if the goal is to get super pain relief help you sleep all of that that's really going to depend on the person and what I usually tell people is start with five to six drops and every fifteen to twenty minutes go up another three to five drops because tincture unlike with regular edibles because it absorbs into your system differently it doesn't take as long for you to feel it so if you had a drink that had tincture in it you're gonna feel that within 15 to 20 minutes typically whereas with an edible Seiya brownie it can take you up to an hour I had one it took almost two hours to hit and I really was just had just resolved that I wasn't even gonna get high at all from this brownie or cookie it may have been a cookie but we got it was a cookie it was snickerdoodle I remember now so I ate this thing thinking that like oh you know this is about 50 milligrams it should work well took almost two hours and then when it hit it hit it was kind of like this slow high for like the first hour the second hour was another little bit of a slow high and then BAM like stupid I so tea sure is similar so I say start with five to six drops and then go up from there and if your goal is to try to get high start with maybe a teaspoon and go up from there teaspoon at a time every 20 minutes or so until you get the desired effect that you're looking for I have known people that have drank an entire ounce in one sitting I don't think any of them really did much to tell about it other than like pass out so that's the thing even with edibles and with smoking with any kind of cannabis once you overdo it once you let cross that threshold of too much it doesn't really matter whether it's a sativa or an indica at that point in my experience at that point you're just oversaturated and you're just gonna go to sleep you're gonna die it's just weed but yeah like even yesterday actually with this trainwreck I overdid it like way overdid it to what I should have used and I ended up just getting like really really high and felt like I wanted to go to sleep so I got that real a heavy body high you know but that's not normally what trainwreck does this is Eva so usually it gets me like kind of hiked energetic and talking a lot like I'm doing right now but yeah I overdid it and I felt like I wanted to sleep but I ended up being able to push through it because I'm out and then after a while it sort of like once the like I started to kind of go away and then it navigated and so like the energy you know hi the sativa energy uplifting kind of high so Dossey really depends on person what I smoked last night that got me will passed the point that I was like ready to go to sleep from a sativa big worm would have it would have had to be like five or six times that for him to even feel it so it definitely depends on person tincture wise I know that a teaspoon maybe a little more than a teaspoon but generally speaking about a teaspoon I'm gonna start feeling the t-shirt if I'm really like trying to get really high the tablespoon but if I consumed a drink with a whole tablespoon which is like a third of an ounce I would pretty much just go straight to sleep so let's see okay so those are the tincture questions and then this one was what strange do you recommend for muscle spasms og cush is pretty good at making you feel really sleepy a lot of the cush greens are and the thing is with muscle spasms is it this is kind of a loaded question because it depends on the root cause of the spasms if you're just if relaxing your body helps the muscle spasm stop then heavy indicas are going to be the ones for you uhm bubba kush OG kush nine pound hammer which we're growing right now but yeah pretty much any of those like real heavy couch strains that just make you want to sleep that should help i would do some research on Leafly and then if you actually just google like best strains for whatever make sure that whatever pops up is from a reputable site so Leafly High Times something like that those three are really good about getting good info out there and good articles so I would bet that one of them probably has it but for me for example I do get muscle spasms in my back occasionally as a result of one of my nerve problems one of my problems it could be the nerve problem it could be the one of the other problems anyway I know that when I put I put my a topical ball on and then I usually microdose about 10 drops of heavy indica Teamster and that usually relaxes me enough that the muscle spasms stop but I don't get high so let's see what was the other question what is waxed dabs and moon rocks okay so black sand dabs that's kind of a low dab this is taking a dab which is using a dab rig it's a concentrate to take a dab so wax is a type of concentrate but the only difference between wax and shatter we're just what people talk about a lot is the processing otherwise they're the same they're both from bicho typically and yeah so moon rocks are a piece of bud rolled in concentrate and then rolled in Keith I could be wrong some of these like dab related questions I don't really dab so if any of our viewers leave a comment below if I'm totally [ __ ] this up right now that's cool just let me know I watched a video about the difference in wax and shatter and that's the only reason I know that they're the same thing except for one is one you can see through and usually is slightly harder in consistency but basically they're the same they're both BHO usually and then it's just the processing either accidentally or not that determines whether it's wax or shatter I'm actually going to look for that video and I'm going to link it below so if you whoa watch that video about concentrate specifically go look down below let's see another question how do you know how many milligrams you need okay so this sort of goes back so I kind of already answered that so I'll just sort of refer back to what I already said about how everything it's different for every person for edibles specifically the general rule is if you've never done edibles before is to start at ten milligrams and then go up by ten milligrams until you get the desired effect I know that in my case if I overdose by even ten milligrams I'm well past saturation and I'm about to just go to sleep but so start at ten and go up I know for me I was thinking that the 50 range was pretty good but that tends to over saturate me so I feel like the 30 to 40 range is better for me and I say 30 to 40 B as part of that depends on the string that it was used for I think but generally 30 to 40 is my like happy place and then anything I even though I am an idiot usually go for 50 um or more when I'm really being oh so start 10 milligrams go up from there a lot of that has to do with how much you consume already so what your tolerance level is your weight can definitely be a determining factor I know that not always but frequently bigger people take more milligrams like if they already have a high tolerance if you've never done anything at all it doesn't really matter in my experience about how many milligrams will affect you however there are people who swear no matter what they can't get high on edibles and usually I tell those people to go try tincture because again in my experience people who seem to not be able to absorb edibles through their guts or you know their gut seem to be able to absorb it through their blood which is what tincture does so edibles made with you know infused butter infused are digested differently and they absorb into your system differently so there are people there's I heard some stoner rumor about it having to do with whether or not you had IBS whether or not that's true I don't know and and I'll promise that by saying anytime I do these Q&A is that anytime there's a link to something I'll link it below but they're so little that we know for sure because there's so little studies that have been done because of prohibition so as it's being legalized more and more and as more studies are being done we're getting more solid information that we didn't necessarily have before so anytime that I have a cool study that I can link down below I will but yeah so if edibles have never worked for you try tincture if you've never done edibles before start at 10 milligrams and go up let's see I'm a cannabis tea so yeah so THC is not water-soluble I'm a little high by the way so at this point now it's probably when my words are gonna start getting a little twisted um so THC does not is not water-soluble so if you make tea with even if there D carb cannabis bud trim stems whatever there are supposed to be no psychoactive effects in that tea but there are the other cannabinoids or most of the other cannabinoids and so it does have benefits and there's a long history of people actually making tea with cannabis I have a link about that I will put it in the description below and I'm really huge on herbal tea I drink different herbal tea blends I make herbal tea for people you know that I mean herbal tea is my thing so I've definitely made cannabis stem tea root tea a few other things but so I definitely made cannabis tea before with the roots or the stems you know whatever I've done that and I'm not gonna thing is that it says there's no psychoactive effects but at least on two different occasions I felt like I was really high like an hour later like had totally forgotten about the tea and then all of a sudden I was like damn I felt really high and and then I thought about it and was like the only thing I had was a tea but but hoarding what I know that shouldn't be the case so I'm definitely not going to tell you that drinking tea is gonna like affect you cycle actively but there are believed to be lots of other cannabinoids they really will benefit from using an entity or a smoothie if you want to get like if you have access to fresh man leaves like if you have a friend that's a grower especially big grow organic they don't this is sort of a moot point but in the girl organic and they have fresh fan leaves that they maybe you're going to cut down they're gonna trim off that happens most just ask them for some and add them to your smoothie in the morning and get all this cannabinoids with Green's is great there's so many vitamins in van leaves again we'll link that below but if you're trying to get any sort of psychoactive effects from tea than what you would want to do is make a basic T and then add tincture if you don't want the psychoactive effects then make tea there's nothing wrong you know there's nothing's mapping from that whoo this up next question who makes the edibles tincture and topical you or big worm I make the topical ball I make all the edibles he usually is the one who makes those things sure sometimes I make it especially if it's an herbal blend like I made some tooth pain drops I did that I made that one I've done a couple of other herbal tinctures the glycerin tincture that I'm working on right now that one I did but and it's not because he knows how to make t-shirt I don't it just tends to be that when he's over at our bar which is where we have like our you know tea Carver and all that stuff um I'll say like oh hey we need some tincture could you make something stir and then he just will or he'll bring it up and be like oh we're low on tincture I'm gonna make some but I'm definitely made it to that that's kind of like his contribution to this side of like the stuff that we make and do so generally speaking though it is me and I don't think I think he could probably could make the topical balm with instructions and a list but at this point I don't even need my book to see the ingredients anymore because I've done it so many times and I know all the measurements and I make them small batches at a time so it's not like I'm making some big batch and then I give it away and then I have to make another big batch I make small batches at a time so next question why is Dee carving necessary for edibles okay dee carving is necessary for edibles because we don't ecard then you don't activate the THC so you won't get any psychoactive effects so yeah that's pretty much the answer that I will put a link down below about Dee carving but uh trying to see if there's any more questions I don't think so I believe that's it so before I finish up this video this is like days later if you can't even tell I've dyed my hair since I shot the video but and excuse the mess I've been like cleaning my house all day and like I'm invest this isn't even my shirt this is big where I'm sure but it was in the dirty clothes and I didn't want to dirty up my clothes clean my house so hot mess moment right now but I found a few more questions and so I just wanted to answer those so that we weren't missing anyone so okay a few of the other questions is our tinctures bud or topical balms best for muscle spasms I pretty much answered this in my opinion although I didn't answer it about bud in my opinion all three are equally good I don't really know best is gonna depend on the person so what's the person what is what's best for that person if you want to know personally about what's best for you you're welcome to private message me any time and I'm happy to discuss the specific symptoms or your history or whatever to try to give you the best advice that I can based on your personal experiences and your personal symptoms because that absolutely makes a huge difference how much bud goes into a bottle of tincture and how do you figure out the dosing we use the green dragon method for tea sure you can look it up but I will put a link down below along with all the other links and so for regular dose tincture it's seven grams for two cups for double strength tincture it's 14 grams to 2 cups so and then how do you figure out the dose think I'm gonna be totally real with you guys okay I have this calculator which is just Lexia for numbers anything to do with numbers is extremely hard for me like I'm I'm mess up numbers a little time like if you're one of my Facebook friends and you're in my private group you're like a DC local then you know all the many stories of me [ __ ] up how much oil I put in something or the amount or whatever and ended up with double strength or triple strength or whatever it happens all the time because I [ __ ] up numbers constantly so he figures out all the math for the dosing I'm I kind of understand it but I'm always afraid I'm gonna [ __ ] it up so I will leave a link below with the detailed explanation of it I'm not gonna even try to pretend to explain it to you I know that for the double-strength it's a 1 gram - 1 ounce ratio so if it is 20% THC then that 1 ounce from that 1 gram is 200 milligrams so I ha did am learning something but yeah I'm not you know everybody has their strengths and weaknesses and when it comes to milligram math and all that that's just not mine because math and numbers in general are not mine the only reason I figured out baking is from lots and lots and lots of practice so yeah anyway I'll leave a link below can you use tincture and baking you can for something that you would use alcohol in or another form of liquid if I've used it in place of vinegar I've used it in place of alcohol I make a really good infused teriyaki sauce and I use it in place of I use it in that so you can also like convert it into infuse sugar which is not that hard to do you can look up how to make green drug and sugar and that's basically what it is is infusing sugar and that makes a lot easier to bake with it I do know that there are people that use just direct tincture baking but in my opinion baking is so precise and it's a science and it has to be like dead-on you know like if it calls for a teaspoon of this and you put a tablespoon you probably [ __ ] up so you can use it but it depends on the recipe I would like to know the basics of turning flowers and edibles and topicals multiple extraction methods that is way too long the subject for me to answer in this Q&A I am more than happy to do a video on how I make oil and butter I'm even more than happy to do a video on how I make ting stir like a top goal I don't mind so and actually since filming the first part of this video my top Kabam won the second annual DC capital cup for best topical balm so I'm pretty pumped about that so as far as multiple extraction methods there are a lot I can I can do a whole video on multiple extraction methods for cannabis and I may do that so the next question will sort of help that question so the next question was is there a basic butter to flour mix or is not dependent on the potency of the flour there is a basic butter to flour mix and so as far as turning flour into edibles and topicals this is a good general idea so for every pound of butter is one ounce of flour so if you're making butter then it's one ounce of bud to four sticks of butter if you're using trim we do double for trim so and we have really good Trent like I've smoked our trim so like when I say trim it's ours from from our grow so I've seen what other people have given other people as trim and it's mostly fan leaves and I that's does that doesn't really count as trim to me trim is like the sugar leaf and like the little bits of the bud that you're cutting off so you get these real nice pretty buds but I've smoked rum plenty of times and it's great but we do double so if I'm using trim instead flower then it's double so it's two ounces of trim - one pound of butter and the same goes for coconut oil although if you use the magic butter machine like we use then you're going to want to put about a quarter cup over the oil if you use coconut oil or olive oil because the magic butter even on the lower temperature setting does seem to burn off some of the oil and I you tend to lose about a quarter cup to a half cup so I compensate for that by adding an additional quarter cup into the recipe so if you're just trying to make like the equivalent one stick of butter then that's one that's 1/4 so 7 grams so I hope that that answered your questions I really appreciate all the questions that everybody asked me I'm more than

less estrogen and that's kind of like the basis of their you know explanation and i just want to kind of dig into the mechanism to explain the ratio of androgens to estrogens a bit and how dhc derivatives can actually play out when you factor they factor in their androgenicity and sort of how they complement cycles that are rich with compounds that are substrates for aromatase so if you have a lot of compounds that convert to estrogen what kind of effect the dhc derivatives could have on potentially minimizing that estrogenic activity when it is too high and you know somebody might otherwise introduce an aromatase inhibitor which you know my thoughts on that um i've talked about the neuro and cardio toxicity and blah blah blah and how well anyway let's let's just get into it so you know there's a very clear relationship between androgens to estrogens and especially in like gyno development i feel like that's a very good proxy for estrogenic activity in the body at least for people who are prone like there's a lot of other things that can be used as proxies as well as like blood work isn't really indicative just an absolute value of estradiol and picograms per milliliter um doesn't necessarily equate to just because you have a high estrogen on paper it doesn't mean your estrogen dominance or something because your ratio of free androgens to estrogen could be fine to an extent where you're not developing gyno even though you have a 70 um pg per ml estradiol so the thing is is one thing i should mention too actually before i forget is there's obviously factors that play into estrogen metabolism that have to do with polymorphisms and genes and stuff like that where somebody could have very slow estrogen metabolism or just impaired metabolism or different uh you know preference preferential pathways of where it metabolizes their estrogen and different conjugates and different [ __ ] like metabolites of hormones like everyone deals with stuff differently and this is why there's such varying individual response to drugs and side effect profile among certain things and a lot of it can boil down to you know like how good is your liver at detoxifying so if you have some guy who has a bunch of polymorphisms that impair detoxification processes and they have another guy who's super efficient obviously comparing oh you got gyno at you know this level of estrogen the exact same another guy with the exact same free androgen profile and free uh circulating estrogen profile it doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna both get gyno with the exact same drug load with the exact same estrogen load in the body because one might be super efficient at getting it out of there another one might not be another one might have more aromatase expression in this tissue one might not it all kind of boils down to individual specific factors but at the end of the day the thing that still dictates much of what kind of activity occurs is the free androgen to free estrogen profile in the body i want to say free i mean not bound to shbg because what a lot of people don't realize is dhc has a five times higher binding affinity for sex hormone binding globulin than testosterone so just because like estrogen you know it has a lower affinity than both of them so if you have all your androgens bound up by shbg or a significant amount of them obviously there's less free androgens to go be anti-estrogens essentially where you need it to be but if you have a significantly higher amount of dht even if your free tea like if you have a high free dht that is largely what's going to boil down to do you have anti-estrogenic properties via your hormone profile or not now that's kind of a vague statement let me let me get into it further before i explain so basically the more free androgens you have not bound up and like can actually go around and do their stuff that's going to dictate how much potential anti-estrogenic activity you can actually accomplish via your hormone profile so by that i mean essentially what we never understood is does the dht in our body or the testosterone that's free or any of the dhc derivatives we use um do those actually inhibit aromatization like do they decrease estrogen levels because that's often what we think is what often what is proposed of what's happening people say oh you know use proviron it's an anti-estrogen or master on anti-estrogen the reality is none of them decrease estrogen levels what they do do though is decrease estrogen-induced rna transcription at the receptor site and this occurs after estrogen binds to the estrogen receptor it's not like it's not like the dhc goes in there or the dhc derivative goes in there and then like prevents estrogen from binding to the receptor like uh like a serum or something like that like it's not like it occupies it or something like that it seems like what it actually does is after it's subsequent to estrogen receptor binding that it actually induces its anti-estrogenic properties which is really interesting because a lot of people think oh you take master on you take proviron it lowers your estrogen levels no it doesn't it actually has no effect on that whatsoever what it does do well obviously you could argue it does depending on the context if you were like only taking that and you suppress testosterone then there's less testosterone aromatized to estrogen blah blah for the sake of argument we're already shut down we're on gear we're using you know like i don't know testosterone and master on or something like that so the testosterone aromatizes the estrogen estrogen normally you know binds to estrogen receptors and um induces uh rna transcription and then the dht that has five alpha reduced from testosterone and uh the draw standalone the master on or whatever we're using is the dht derivative in this example um that's the same compound by the way if you didn't know um goes and it doesn't just like like wipe out estrogen out of the system nor does it go bind to the estrogen receptor at least from what i can tell in the data or at least from what i can extrapolate it seems like like it says in here i'm going to read this statement here this was called evaluation of androgen antagonism of estrogen effect by dihydrotestosterone so it doesn't matter if this is dht necessarily it's simply an androgen so the androgenicity of another anabolic energetic steroid like masteron is going to accomplish this via the exact same mechanism it's just the tissue cell activity and the androgenicity is going to vary accordingly based on the compound but you can extrapolate this for yourself based on the same mechanism of action here so these findings suggest that the mechanism of dhc antagonism of estrogen effect in this organ system does not involve inhibition of synthesis of estrogen receptor as has been shown for progesterone but appears to occur by decreasing estrogen-induced rna transcription at a point subsequent to estrogen receptor binding so that is key to keep in mind because after receptor binding so that means it's not preventing it from binding it's not reducing the amount of aromatization occurring it's not being anti-estrogen it's literally preventing the estrogen from doing what it's supposed to do in the body so even after it's bound to the receptor dht or whatever androgen dhc derivative you're using literally goes in and like [ __ ] up the receptor to the point that it doesn't allow the estradiol to do what it's supposed to do even after it's bound so how exactly that mechanism occurs it decreases it that's what we know we know where it does that how it does it is kind of remains a bit unseen but what we do know is that it prevents the body from transcribing its effects and tissues like it normally would it's almost like it goes in there and confuses the bound bound part to the receptor and tells it it tells us its instructions are no longer working correctly which is interesting so is this just like the body's way of telling you if you otherwise had excessive amounts of dht it would be you know you would think your body would be doing it for a reason to maintain some homeostatic process to get to some end result or else there wouldn't be that androgen there so if you have an excess free androgen profile that thing is providing some signal that's preventing the other signal from working correctly how exactly it's doing that is above and beyond my [ __ ] expertise but what we can see is that it has nothing to do with wiping estrogen out of the body it's not an aromatase inhibitor it's not an anti-estrogen it's something that literally opposes the rna transcription after binding so even if you have these sky-high estrogen levels on paper if you have enough androgens in there it's going to go to all these receptors and tell them they'll like not do what they're supposed to do which is interesting because it doesn't actually have anything to do with aromatase so you on paper you have a lot of guys proactively inhibiting the enzyme aromatase just because they see a number on a piece of paper where they may not even have a clue that they have more than enough free androgen in their system to inhibit that estrogen-induced rna transcription that would otherwise in the lack of sufficient androgens there cause gyno or cause these estrogenic overflow issues that you might not even need to worry about so just because you have a 80 90 picogram per milliliter estradiol doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to run into issues if there's enough free androgen there to [ __ ] with the receptor and tell it to not do what it's supposed to do at least that's what it appears to be and that's probably why a lot of people can get away with running you know guys with good genes or can run you know like several several hundred milligrams even some guys upwards of like 750 plus of test without an ai without getting gyno maybe their body is just very good and uh five alpha reducing to dht and getting that to the [ __ ] receptor and telling it to not do what it's supposed to do or they have incredibly efficient estrogen metabolism it doesn't really you know there's a lot of different factors i could play into it but at the end of the day you don't need to proactively inhibit aromatase just because of a number on a piece of paper which is something that should be everyone should know but at this point in my opinion based on uh if they want to remain healthy on cycle if they want to not inhibit their progress unnecessarily if they want to maintain proper growth cascades via the gh igf-1 axis mediated through estrogen um there's a lot of things that really weren't not proactively inhibiting aromatase for no reason like some people are just popping a rimmed axe like candy just because they see oh i'm not in the 20 to 30 picogram per milliliter range i need to be on a remodex right now even though they have more than enough free dht to support the anti-estrogenic activity at the receptor subsequent to binding that would be necessary to prevent any of these issues from occurring in the first place so now not only do they have the prevention of the you know at the receptor site but then on top of that they're inhibiting aromatase to the point where they're getting potentially you might even have a 20 to 30 picogram per milliliter estradiol but maybe you're even still getting that anti estrogenic activity at the receptor and you're getting the equivalent of a much less amount of estrogen even though on paper you have an in-range level that looks healthy do you know what i'm saying so it's like if you're cranking hard and you're on aromatase inhibitor and you have a dht derivative that might otherwise have a significant anti-estrogenic activity subsequent to estrogen receptor binding you could be even though on paper you think you're in the sweet spot you may be [ __ ] yourself because you could be getting this anti-estrogenic activity plus the anti-aromatase so you know just something to keep in mind and is something that um i think a lot of people would argue is a more well-thought-out approach to um dealing with estrogenic issues is obviously the main approach would be just not reaching that point to begin with where you then need to burden yourself potentially with more free androgens to inhibit this estrogen-induced rna transcription above and beyond what you otherwise need like ideally you would just you know fulfill the baseline amount that you can get before you even need to worry about that and then start like stacking on top with more tissue selective anabolic agents so then you don't need to kind of like pull things back i don't know it kind of depends on the person again though and the cert the situation and the goals of course but um i just think there are a lot of steps that make more sense to do proactively before you kind of go nuclear and start inhibiting indiscriminately inhibiting the aromatase enzyme in your brain and your heart everywhere you need it you know what i mean so like there's ways to deal with this receptor activity that are potentially better alternatives to inhibiting aromatase it's kind of like the end of the vid the whole point of the video and just because there's a number on a piece of paper it doesn't necessarily mean [ __ ] so take that into account so there's a good reason why drugs like you know like draw standalone used to be used to treat breast cancer prior to the development of novel selective estrogen receptor modulators and obviously the androgenicity is what largely limited its uh efficacy in a clinical context for women but i mean you know it was very good at what it was doing and what it was intended to do minus the side effect profile of masculinization for guys it's less of a big deal unless you care about hair loss you're gonna get [ __ ] if you use masteron and you're prone to hair loss but anyways it's very good at anti-estrogenic activity at the uh at the breast so that's why it was deployed clinically for that exact reason and it largely boils down to exactly what i just explained so um take that into account when you are designing your protocols is that um dhc derivatives and just things with high levels of android because not this doesn't apply to all dhc derivatives by the way they're all just because they're derived from dht some are far more tissue selective than others some are far more energetic than others it doesn't necessarily mean they're all going to do this so keep that in mind when you're designing your protocols too but just in general this is something to take into account and maybe leverage for a more uh i don't know health conscious i don't even know if that's the right word but it's a potentially a smarter overall approach to um cycle design in my opinion so think from that way you will thank you guys for watching

this is to take this IPO next day this is a bucket shaper that one can imagine we underneath artists but in the there is no good prospects if you take a drop of left put it somewhere immediately we close alarm you by that man you know what happens and some chemical bomb on have an infractions to super molecular interactions they give different signals and that is a value or something purpose then for molecular imaging if you go for MRI scan or computed tomography CT scan they inject some chemicals into your body and some life is fast at that time when these molecules have an interaction with a protein in your body and you two back to white which we call it an external stimulus some signals are filled you take a scan similarly for methylate extraction from the holes there are particular researchers for particular cation for example if you want to take iron from an old Oh so you put as probability and which captures captures one eye on leaving behind the other so it is easy 50 iron from that so meta then drug delivery system I'll get that let's delve into means some drugs are not soluble but if you take out your big feet the inclusion conflicts that means some which is included inside the psychotics it will be solid so it can cross through the other person is as follows the lipid layer internal body and the place where it has to be delivered it will be terrible take and the secular that still can be experienced so architect elevation and for catalysis some molecules do not react in normal conditions but when you put a Supra molecule into that inside the cavity of the supra molecule these two molecules react so these are all some of the applications practical applications which are utilized in the current current century so who are the pioneers of this there are three famous personalities come on J come from us they still marry land from France and PJ Patterson from you with me therefore find the nobel prize in layer 1987 for the development and use of molecules which are two specific interactions of enthalpy in particular it is for seated Fredersen well come up with the crown ether coordinating the production which is important contributions subsequently after three decades this chemistry a clean won a Nobel Prize in 2016 almost he begins by 413 furusawa from France princess cannot from USA and that night L bring us from Netherlands for the interruption and advancements of molecular evolution so these from chemistry these supra molecules can be choosing to make a molecule equations so those areas like a nun of car or a switch or a molecular muscle and tell the few in the later slides so this gives rise to many real-world application so you can know that importance of this supramolecular chemistry because the three decades of the no foofy has won the Nobel Prize for this so what we find is the so prominent chemistry of intermolecular pull away the structure and functions of the entities or by the association of two or more chemical species building non covalent interactions by gene many men and Roxanna both click told it is chemistry you're normally you can ratify the super molecules into three types one is the chemistry of molecules with specific shapes or architectures examples of epoxy happen in the driver veneerings and carbon nanotubes etc so that later if the second one is the lock and key or the Oscars chemistry which is associated with a molecule a molecule the third one is chemistry of molecular assembly that is the same person and he files multiple equalities miss Elise vesicles the profile is like that of your cleaning action of soap where the formation of metals that is nothing but a proper little fulfillment process so all these three put together molecular recognition chemistry chemistry of molecular assemblies and chemistry of molecular associations of the purple package of Dominic Wilkins so these are all some of the important concepts we shall see one by one one it will self-assembly how they are something together for me like our DNA it's full fights and then molecule a recognition to recognize various analytes oh yes chemistry mechanically interlocked molecular dodging architectures and finally the dynamic over in this so there are three possible categories of synthesis of these types of molecules small molecules which I have shown here these type of small molecules covalently organized or synthesized to form a larger molecule this equality is a molecule and this is recognized the gist to form a supramolecular or host-guest complex and can be read through various analytical spectroscopic data etc so this can be done in boats with patients team and solids similarly larger molecules for example organic linkers and the smallest molecules metal atoms metal ions these know instrumentation forms a certain structure which is solid state in nature we have zeolites we have flat plates similarly synthetically we can help more planning it works like this so these methods goes and sits in the lattice position and they may have force inside where the force will be applied for various applications the third one is small molecules they formally joined the firm like a molecule in fact with the help of an external stimuli like Helmuth like light or pH conditions it's on tear easily organized to form a self-assemble aggregate this can happen both in solutions T and V it's okay I'm told there is no covalent or ionic interaction so what sort of infractions then you put on material inside the FICA or texting I told you in this time if you take a cup fill which is open at the bottom and then you put something inside it is because of peace-pipe interactions ionic and dipolar interactions hydrogen bonding my contractions whatever interaction and hydrophobic getting so because I know this is a fundamental but let me see this quickly so in ionic interactions there are three kinds so you can see here there is an interaction between this nitrogen and chlorine both are ions or the different negative there exist an interaction between each through this process ion-ion interactions in the case of tetrahedral ammonium chloride this is a typical pronator I will come to that later on to name and everything so this crown ether has a dipole with oxygen with a cation this is for this ion dipole interactions so now you can understand this crown ether is for index legs or carries a sodium inside its cavity into an ion dipole in front there is no covalent or ionic bond third one is in take acetone molecules if the into a simple molecule there is a small partial negative and partial positive charge dipole dipole so these three contribute to the ion dipole interactions easily it can be the important thing a hydrogen bonding which is here in a human body many of our amino acids proteins and even DNA on hydrogen bonding so any hydrogen atom which is attached to an electronegative atom bombs and hydrogen bond with another electronegative line so it creates a small positive charge and it conduct or not the other one is an acceptor so between these donor and acceptor there is an editable poly and the well-known example optoelectronic we know which forms intramolecular hydrogen bonding here and parametric phenol between two molecules it forms I didn't want so this type of editing bonding very very important is don't need the PI interactions I don't know how many of you really understood by PI stacking on by fighting factions so this pi 5 interactions and you talk about in the next line it is again negative 3 tachyon five any on file and follow fighting factions so Kathy on five it is the interaction between Kathy on these two it's right then it is forces can't even fight in fractions is the any of interactions so one can think both are negatively charged out there with the attractions for example if you have electron withdrawing groups around this benzene ring you could take Xiao fen take so the electron if this here is the electron for reaching and there it is electron gets region there is an interaction which is on its annual binary and the third type is followed by interactions there are permanent dipole molecules example is water so this permanent dipole molecules and defy electron cloud there is this an interaction which is for this bullet might in fact these are also possible so this I told you if I find interactions here divided by interactions into three types one is the sandwich type that is to benzene ring comes together face-to-face they have any fractions which you can see in graphite molecule or even you can see in the DNA taste friends they signed the teacher that is one the second one is age to face one benzene ring is perpendicular to the other basically here in India so this marshal positive item have an interaction with the pilot from plum so this is called as edge to face and the third one is this place so this positive will be with this paella from clock and this possibility electron this is for this handle is placed on this place so these are all different types of final interactions which is involved in Romani incomes the fourth one is Wonderwall sit fractions everybody knows you know this very well if the fluctuations from electron distribution we have two things one is the london interaction because of the exchange and repulsion interactions so two instantaneous telephones attract each other any fraction so you can see here it comes it was evolving work on the nucleus but this nucleus affects this electrons towards its life and this link is attracts the other nucleus to excite there exists an instantaneous dipole it is not a permanent icon this instantaneous dipole due to this they are attracted to each other and this also plays a major role in the final one is the type of origin for example if you take this cavity this cannon so when you put some other finishes inside are all arranged in it at the nice man then you put a guest molecule inside the water smash outside and it becomes disordered so entropy factor arises so this is one such hydrophobic effect the second one is to organic molecules creating a hole within our face face giving rise to the info hydrophobic that this one more is more stable than two so when you take oil and water mix together and still there may be many many oil droplets floating on the water but after some time although I joined together to form one so that is what this one hole is posted on that so this place a major role its molecular interaction and this is taking place in article structures like their hydrophilic heads and the heck up of it things they join to form micelles and they've subsequently joined vesicles etc in lipid bilayers so I have gone through brief introduction to there's no molecular in fact interactions right now what is the fundamental law what is the basic thing for this problem as arise it is by Professor ml this Chuck will often eat principle even he won the Nobel Prize did nineteen not true so for in order for two species to interact in a specific fashion they must have complementarity of relativity science and good chemistry between then just like a lot fits into it so in a fitting into a lock so for different types of peace cannot cope with the same laws so it should me think the law can't eat it could be same so this is very nice even before molecule structure was well understood that shape and size max defines reporting's shape and size of a molecule is more important in the case of supermarkets if that peepers but if don't have a ceremony games Oh so the maken Ethan's fell after his invention I've shown you here he lock and key principle the lock and the key then it exactly fits and it opens so there is sort of infection so the cavity size change everything not escape but there are several drawbacks in this lock and key things if you dismiss the enzymes are highly flexible so they cannot be rigid and they are conformationally dynamic in solution unlike a rigid law so these are all the drawbacks these drawbacks when in doubt by professor Danny's first well in nineteen fifty and he came up with a useful in this enzymes are dynamically when conformationally dynamic we know that so there are certain things always active sites with an enzymes they change shape and size according to the subject so that they can accommodate the substrate it indicate a senior enzyme here is not I mean deform different cavities Chaffins fine but here the substrate is different but when the substrates approaches the enzyme changes itself I can shape and forms in terms of so this is where the inspiration taken and super multiple chemistry is developed so we are using synonymous technologies like a host gift or at the gunmetal on the snow we saw intense substrate you can see if this is the key so some enzymes carrying a hydrophobic interactions at one part electrostatic interactions are out of the path I didn't go in a car that path it exactly fits your protein molecules or the recent past so that then desired properties ATP's so the study of non covalent interactions is very very crucial to understanding many biological processes from the cell structure tradition that rely on these forces for structure and part of it is so biological system or often the inspiration for supramolecular this is even now we are struggling hard to find a drug or a max in front of it so we know the structure of it and we know how it goes is it a body where it attacks we know that it attacks so we make infinite safar's and then we perform some drug molecule synthesis and we should have the interaction between those two sent back to the third exactly so that the respect X would not multiply or kill the virus so that this is going to cure so this is very important I told you with this deigning our body theory the bonding will be in the base past 5000 entire main phyto signal timing or adenine and guanine here it's involving hydrogen bonding because of this hydrogen bonding you have your DNA molecular structure similarly you have biotin streptavidin phosphorous conference oil pin binds to a protein called a suspect traveling step dominant is working but the amino acids all around everywhere it's not important this is the PI of the Muslim between these two there exist a hydrogen bond so these are all the things which are already getting inside our body it is happening inside of a pony so taking that inspiration you have developed many synthetic molecules in super molecules so this is one other example just now it would be about four threads it is an iron drug and find it you can take children I'm so do it so if you think the drug which is used to commit low blood pressure and then for asked my cetera but not selected soda everything is bruised for like a sinus problem or nose masking momentum so you can see you're in this structure there is this voyage group is facing down it is that in fact I don't go big area as this one but this hydrogen bonding this is responsible for write it in whatever sector so if forward body has a receptor suitable receptor for this orange bond so it has a nitrogen birthday and your drug action increase but in the case of pseudo mp3 this voyage is missing here it is missing here and it's not taking because the disease are it will not have this low blood pressure or bonding so coming to the classification let's see one by one so this is the first one you can monofins covalently organized or synthesized to follow the cost and depending upon the cavity so here you can see this cavity is very them so one is this molecule can be accommodated here and not this friendly so fine on covenants into the specific molecule so it collectively finds widely fist and not this so that is for this professor Patterson in 1967 and he discovered the crowding this is what all this from either type in so from him he did a small organic reactions to prepare this phenol this morning to develop this we know but she's got an impurity that is 0.4 first synthetic organic chemists will note this we should not live off the impurities present in any reactions to take that impurity and he has analyzed and he got a final product of just 0.4% as thousands of communist this is form because of sodium here this odium is encapsulated in the middle as a template and this morning to respond so this is the spot and for this you know we can work we got a slogan for us so that's what I mean selectivity this the finding of a guest one guess on a family of this significantly goes wrong with their others by a hosta molecule selectivity is measured in terms of the ratio between equilibrium constants you can see you can take this as a host molecule there are several analyzed maybe metals may be anions in the amino acids for teams even the bacteria molecules there are many molecules or pops lips etc according to the shape and size one day this will be exactly fitting not in others so this is called as a Supra molecule or a super molecule and this makes 1g because of non-covalent points and there is no other covalent or ionic bonds in it and this is for NASA infamously and this is for this correctly because one please select this one according to the shape and size and the chemistry the for creativity the complementarity between the phosphorus points so this is one of our research work so this is what the most molecules which is for this PPT and it has five different hetero atoms here so these hetero atoms will donate a pair of electrons you can see here this is done by volumetric analysis fluorescence several cations are will have been analyzed one leaf silver Excel actively finds not all the other ions and you can see the color change also like and it has been determined with an MRI patient console so this is coldest for example if you want to selectively test the calcium content in your body you need a nice texture or calcium alone but if you make a sensor for all the metals then it is of your use so it should selectively bind calcium and get the value but it will be competitive with other metal ions such a thing or cadmium with the exit so this is called is okay let me explain in a layman language everybody know about the watermelons you can still shape on different carbons it'll be like a well or a rose or but because of its shape oval shape transportations is very high you cannot arrange that in a clock you have to just throw it it splits from one point to another instead of loading for example if you lowered bricks you can load in an Nikolas organized manner on a fire but these watermelons cannot become so one scientist thought of that so for these problems he came with and you know in a five year it that is called is the fire watermelons you might have seen this in cookie so this image is in Japan and China so they have made a cage around it and so this fire might come along for cutting it's very easy I think this is very so that shape size and not only watermelons these days you can have see whatever shape you want you can have a spire in like a shape even koo kumba and have a square Apple so no more eating for your kids like banana will be this shape mango will be this shape Allen will be this shape never so after the advancement of this super humble in the chemistry each and every shape and size example even you can have orange it is pentagon orange you can have even number this is the three in C so everything is possible these days because as I told you the next generation or the next error will be mainly on sopra molecular biotechnology so it depends upon the spacer no more each entity is of pumps in which there's all right so let me go down to the three important aspects that is combining annual binding and one o'clock so when I will discuss I made one example of the molecule and how it forms the finding in fact so carry on binding you all very well know that cation for flex has played an essential role in any biological system so large quantities of sodium professional equation culture they are in particular critical to life sodium and potassium are very much even now unknown person is admitted in the hospital on lower sodium another one day delay he met at birth before but now he's slowly improving with lot of sodium content so the importance of metal ions is shown given in pupils these are on the essential at ions calcium sodium potassium ignition and trace elements like iron copper for pulsing it should be balanced in your body it should be neither high no no their importance in our body so sodium panache if they regulate body metabolic soups can shield bones and needs for not fighting you know variable then metal of proteins and mechanisms for the Ducks reactions like that if it any disorders of this that means whether it is higher in functions are lower in frontal anemia liver it mean damage happens in the case of thing fight when you're trying to occurs or in the case of copper so the carnitas you know very well I think this is an example for the Mafia oh yeah so cyclic following it was derived from repeating o ch2 ch3 units it forms people of Nexus with metal ions as we saw the first appearance in what yes that and it has many synthetic reactions reactions involved so this is the typical chronica it is called as eighteen crowns things so this is like a crown for a cape so it represents like that so the name from came and it has six oxygen atoms so it is six and you can see the number of birds if it all so this is one two three so here 3 6 9 12 50 and 80 so ad-hoc things are going to insert is anything between yes like you and we must thank you something okay so this is what that chrome neither wings so this ground meter you can see there's a stipulated diagram it is like highly negatively charged cavity inside because of this oxygen requirements it's so African it finds with potassium later with sodium or with Libya elements it only binds with this profession because of the shape and size a stable do is that the base of its in protection because here the simulated things so the example I have to tell you what is the use of this from me I am completely and solidly this potassium chloride is not soluble in fencing but then you for taking from inside that so this potassium is captured by this count and the story is reading so this falling is the way and it is highly reactive and this is called as naked animal cell so this Jeff is carried into benzene and it is called as a naked a neon effect and it is highly reactive so this can be used in reactions that's what I do here so you can see it when you want to convert one promo obtained for one floor oh octi if you use air you know that KF is not soluble it is not fancy and if you put air in some of the protic solvents this chlorine is strong it's all wasted by the ion dipole forces yes it before and it is naked basically if your period if you fight you have an acrylic substitution for this drove it by : so you add a pinch of again thrown sticks with fluid so this 18 curve six captures this potassium so that this for in which is called the naked Anja easily replaces the probic without this again comes it is absolutely Millions this is one typical example and what is the use of commodities so depending upon the size and shapes here for Chrome for iPhone you give four oxygen atoms so it is 4 and then 1 2 3 6 9 and pursuit welcome for a 10-5 with lithium we can find with sodium potassium rubidium a shape of the cavity up in chromium on nitrogen it is called as Arthur crops and thereby develop victims fianc Lariat eaters except I have just discussed one example for Pantheon findings all here is so this is another application I think told you it is used in excel chemo biosensor so a panic molecule is designed to find and send small molecules of metals or ions so three type of things needed here a chlorophyll and Lincoln and an eye on afford so this ionic or finds with this metal ion and so that there is a signal changes this flow to move so fast ik name is taken and you can however you move by offset set for whatever metal ions you want or amino acids or ions cations so this is called as a further for the linker or a phase but these type of things this supramolecular chemistry as a hostess chemistry is used there are many many sensors have been developed so I am coming to the same thing the selectivity so this molecule cost is called esteem or sensor exactly fitting with any of these analyst that is the metal ions and metal ions and it forms a complex so that it flows Aidan inches so this is where we spot the molecular recognition in selectivity so the chemo sensor on metal ions on the complex if you have different signals so this is what I told you in hands-on pictorial diagram so you have a hospital and we have different metal ions or any other land yachts so exactly matching the shape and size gives you a signal that can be transferred to a value you can get the details then cut off your table that glucose sensors or any other stations so the working one prize there is no interaction there is more information so that is what is super Monique active axis all well next it is the receptor for three you have seen four cations it is almost suspecting a reciprocity very equal as most of the Tetons of spherical extreme but if it is for Amiens depth we properties they come in many shapes and sizes example highlights or tourism I'll find it Linnea if you take my feet if this try not to make us fail into the technical exam problem phosphate ahead me so on so you imagine about the nickel oxide leaky pipes or the biological molecules inside of the computer for example this Co 819 they are mounted into it with a plus one is the CD one posted it was proper to say to one four seven and TRD simply because regulated cookies this happened east but we need to know these data structure I'm designed as longer a vaccine in that infection takes place and ages other sphere simulations are many occasions to overcome this for in nineteen again detail most irons interests in a narrow pH thing they don't have to wipe his face the one to put in there what there is what the notice the quickly its range and they are generally coordinate we coordinated to set with Alexis we have song for kids production to so what sort of sometimes we can use for this animal you can have charge mister class that is positively charged we second one with me you will suffer so it can happen possibly in charge of the surplus red planet in use elevators you can see here it places it contains a small positive charge on its own so that it cannot write the carboxylic engines similarly within your derivative also can have unbox late panels as positively charged receptor is in shape for a neon it excess and apart from that Oscar chart I don't do even the interactions like a token 185 you can see this particular molecule here you can see there is a possibility odd involve ask Phyllis yeah i didn4t visit but this can capture the annual very well so these they focus at first or much more efficient then when we positive example why this is the first articulation for example many of you are suffering in thyroid agent I have income may be more or less any but one adult for many both are biochemical level it will immediately tell some values define how it is done so these a purpose of cars have been inspected to capture oil in here once there is an interaction between the iodine and this molecule is some value I got you something so without these you cannot get into your body constantly making glucose for example so you need to have a neon mr. pack there so it is a combination of then we shall go to the neutral molecules the third one can see this is a was an extreme is a molecule it's typically living to a was so if that's our funding of funding and unloading and this is a macro cycle like this so it can encapsulate molecule different animal inside so this is constructed with phenol molecule to disorder can scream if it is consistently that's how small it is called in this countries and so on and here this calyx green and that means a lipoma lipid that it's impossible to live here it is in here to that of after football World Cup so this is the simulated and how we can encapsulate so this isn't happening and throwing the applications before what is the use of this concoction so you can see this as if if with neutral molecules why because it's things is not really available wait a sec excuse me Thomas acrylic speak and they are three organized macro cycles that means their family their dimensions are predefined they're not order them so only according to this cavity spice under sail physical shape who can accommodate at this point sometimes if it is smaller it will not be holding here if it is pigeon if they're not go inside here it should be this is very nice and in synthetic we have to consider them so this is also cavity molecules will be put something it means collective all of them but some of the test molecules on earth will find itself it is prepared from glycol unit this is called like Oliver 6-button units forms vb6 this one five thirteen weeks died upon CB 5 and so on and so forth and this is frequent videos because this belongs to find it so from there to put in this victim and be there given the name ass like which means much so you can see the inclusion complexes in fact site where they see you with improve it and then exclude it you can make many examples on any reaction this one it can be used as a phase transfer catalyst between organic and no substance not soluble in organic fish which are soluble in excess space funding these paper prediction can be added inside so it can be bespoke the organic quality components to be is volatile component somebody actually takes so you can have products the cockpit can be 1,400 categories any number of catalytic reactions at least compared to degrees so in an action on-screen chemistry molecule papers is going to form molecules mean and that may be nice it was an default gets tricky on molecules the second one is the self or something according to the vaccinations you can see here the molecules want is people aren't even they are not ordered a on this oddity but then you give an external stimulus like that will be something they become and on finish and it is then you think oh he external stimulus it will go back in socially for these type of things the qualitatively very much for example a middle can be transparent at one stage then they are this one is there but when you switch on the light will be fast electric current or when you fast eat or do something external to where it'll mean it may organize itself and become perfect so like these type of can he subsequently is born in nasik say this condition cell for the Mythbusters how do you see that you put a template in the middle along this can take all these things homes and Supra molecule and then you can remove that technically you get a molecule like this they all come together because of this thing in this organization we have many many architectures structures here let us see some of them with up all that matters it's plastic and they have different properties like optical magnetic activity mainly they are fitted with two things one is the liquor organic molecule the other one is the metal liner consider they have three basic clothes one is the recognition because they have this collective interaction of complementary components as it was the still site for creativity complementary complementarity and it's tennis - between the two random and antimatter second one is orientation how they worry what x11 is after building up the present I mean come on so these are all the parking diagrams it can be here a rock is there a ladder is they at Chris this way is it possible to have a set of vectors in chemistry and chemical molecules first you can see your if you take a couple demos with a help of material metal this is organic dig on this is organic ligand and this is a convenient Atlas missile ruthenium better they both going to form the help of an imperfect regard to the content of acrylic on and metal ions average intellect work that is showing it is called this ladders and these parts accordionist folks similarly if you take your poly perfectly one this is one fiber pretty another biker it is connected by a number of systems like this these are called as monks and priests practised on call this lattice can often act as a template for multiple chemistry these are called as maddux come on equal that and similarly you can have soprano if you're great at square it that can look lik even chiral with it's very much possible so I have shown the content I do not an example of the typical size the next one is mechanically interlocked supra molecules yeah absolutely no covalent bonds or chemical bonds are involved it is just like that you changed connected to each other so they are getting 100 of each other to form a single and beneath it is supported by supramolecular interactions so this is called as a neurotoxin you can see here this is called a set of boxing and this middle green color represents we met recycle and these bulky groups are called as we tap infants so this macro cycle will not sleep away from here a typical tumbles what you call it so you can see here this other person if one half the cap or the cap is missing then it is called as pseudo for boxing see the structure this is a five-minute molecule this is the capping agent and this five-minute molecule it Maps the macro cycle next it in the middle and this is the other than 5 so you can hear this is the typical transcription of concrete so the site where it's in microcephaly singer and both the spaces it is not typical for toxins from I put the architectures of supramolecular chemistry isn't one the second one is Kathy needs for this is new ring structures there is absolutely no connection between these two but they are did it with the help of big waterworks or interaction so here it causes one time on full time so and two molecules in wallet is crossing to Kathleen but here it was a smart 3 & 4 so 4 crossing to Catholics so this is the example if Athena is one of the structures and the piping they actually the tylium guys going to get a Kathleen stuff you can see your this example this is called as a molecular switch so here when they offer one stage then it is in for one complex it is coordinated to cannot contain oxygen come on come on snap one then you get it right this much stuff but when it is nice to offer to you get a square pyramidal now it is attached to be temperate in molecule so this is called as on/off first switch on and to talk so this can be used as molecular switches Kathleen's the next one is not so they are quite frequently in everyday life both in a micro so people like the tie their shoelaces and even DNA for market sir it's here just like a family and even teeth and they are physically present this e is not equal into this one so these both are idle therefore this energies you can see are you can take this conundrum molecule it forms itself with an F of a metal becomes a not like structure here for the supramolecular parlament not oxy or not you have follow me eighths so this is typical rearing system five rings we know this use for full of its feeding system so the one onion rings pan sits on a different setting or ma Union link so this name came from the premium family there is Kelly I mean come back removing any ring the sons is to unlink rings that is no true of the feelings are linked together if you remove any one related places so this all previously so no two of the theory then nonetheless I think it's honest for a week so the example is this when if they fight with it derivatives and react with two for two things getting the idea with it please pay for follow me with a thing okay so those are all some of the structures there are very many spectres involved so I have given you a few example of Sycamore different architectures and there it is involved according our molecular systems which in the case of attack wing but you can see the rocks it you can feel this is ferric oxide is this cat here this is kept here and each moment recycles out there in the middle so this is in the pig and this is in deep - state between ecology just as big and an example for the Bisons and it takes my sex when it is five in this polishes and it is black the external stimuli is your lights off they will 254 nanometers you get like this or you get like this so pick based on me x7 Finland you get if I jump in for the backspace so this can act as a molecular model typical one example so like that there are many many examples there are some highly it has like this is it is an having times and I'll put chemistry and having said that to me I said yeah thank you so the last part will be frameworks or solid people speak they are the organic linker and the metal ion clusters together form these papers permission we have known the typical radius feathers so these metal of ice cream box or a new classic system - on phone sweetie come find this all this s metal on the forest we always fight between find this so some football has metal organic pigments and come fall it has metal of managed porous materials but then assign this Korea and Maria here so when you have metal and the Afghani clinker is all metal of your treatments it's automatic and these are the artificial form smithing is working top three context on this pixel so how do you design you take the metal ions and with various size and shape of the ligand which ever you want and also the minute whatever in the kinds of fatigue and even the coordination behavior of the metal suit in terms and event with segments of Records with differently of syllables you can see this is one office one face which is called as mo f5 benzene dicarboxylic acid it will finding that oxalic acid I think at this form is something which is called as elbow at point there are force here there it can have gas rate then mo f7 people this is mo of 74 benzene they pop off the gas it is two hydroxyl groups which I have a high carbon dioxide absorption to fight of course this comes so similarly we have in I am onion there are n number of things they might have to pee for me I go fix me things like that there are semi you can see the liquid I'm forget a few examples of them is how they can be simplified by solve example I do feel more microwave-assisted as form of chemical mechanical chemical so on and so forth so they have to learn industrial applications because the e XE goods two things they're extremely large surface area and there what you mean with this person can be very we can have to have a discussion they're also very robust rigid so these are all the various applications they can use for separation to reduce tension molecule drugstore a catalyst eliminated many many applications are in the hips so far yes pinochle non-covalent interactions what about making food : yes so you can see you're selecting additional roles so I'm not talking about amino alcohols I'm talking about the chirality conversion of nationalities it non-superimposable mirror images so this is a typical buy.com which is an actual incredible it is Italian you can execute an dependent or a tiny group of hydrogen bonds on us so this a DI reacts with an inny with an amino acid which has an amine group so it forms an alanine or an amine and it forms a decimal participate hydrogen bonding with this for H so that is : vaulted and this hydrogen bond this is called as the non covalent interactions the colon dhanraj and the nonpolar is like in if you put an L amino acid in 48 hours all the mid-1992 evening so here involves both : and here this is for the this is what the alda me when this is the Kyra because of the esthetic info this here and this is what is super bowl in your interaction wonderful super molecule attraction hydrogen and this is your appetite isn't bonding and this is : and so you can see what happens so this is a typical receptor I'm not talking about this citizen yeah so it has an idea group here and as Union group here this two ended of 12 hydrogen bonds on us that's it reacts with this it forms a needy and the evil age group reacts with this o hydrogen bonding so the M amino acid reacts with candy 24 hours to 48 hours of time the El Camino so when you block this that's when I start to spread hydrogen body it's a trouble if it interacts with a new clock despite entry for Molly please - but you can see here with the songs of ABBA accent so this is the ISM a spectrum this is that Amy o'clock so this in hit this proton is given here and this - in line for part are given there and this pH - for thought I'll give it here then there - so forget about the others you can see this protons yeah this is one point m and the other for e so this is for n because of this covalent interaction and this and this so this is in the case of fun it won't be recognized this is radiation between E and n but then you take natural amino acid this is finite Allanon ln xi xi then you put this np9 it's not a little it is a learnin so when you put this here in flight waveforms giving bond and there is a non covalent hydrogen bonding here and is an hydrogen bonding interaction here you can see all these are on the n a LAN is in pain one one our failure if this goes on for days you can see all of my and it's converted to T we can see again Alana's feet diminishes and the p1 is big - so you can see for each other 24 available or maximum mass you can see the IEP for the unity they yell at the spot one over the else take his boat but as time goes on in whatever hours all the elements definition on the DS so that means this is another advantage of for combining supramolecular I mean combining the covalent and so let us come to the super intensity applications as I shown you it is used in chemistry it isn't one of your imaging expected not combination a delivery services so you can see yogi as not speeding people it it can be helpful in as a phase transfer catalyst then you can have a potassium captured here and thrown in the street so you can have weekly substitute reactions so it's not delivery system this may not be fulfilling with itself a space but on investigation into psychotic spinning whether it's available it can be deliberately not and separation of mixtures you can take an image it's very important I can explain or something inside it captures p6p so that we can keep 3d taken away by solids I think it's going but this guy is insoluble in following so much menu it didn't protocol and this game so it is used for separation of mixtures and then as I told you the molecular census for this in theory supported through the course and molecules whatever it is and there and this group yes because whenever the guest is fine it gives signal we want and this is I told you the molecule scripted it all and switch off so this is a plot of four and this can take the podium here when it binds for you this flow or many French or something so we can get this then phase transfer catalyst there's no we saw and then senator Supra monochrome so this whole movie of this is a pie of chemo success so this is the signaling unit and you have a face then if we have a reporter for a receptor group when a first paper analyze find here the signal unit gives a signal this is an example you can see the same accent we went wrong here so impacted from something and it feels something I come to conclusion by that rules cannot be replaced by gurus and teachers cannot be replaced by a comma and you", "SrrLj9hrev4": "foreign foreign cumin powder 1 teaspoon foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign you", "yQ1yqiDi6To": "thank you all right my name is Lynn reamer I'm known as a mad chemist because I have a degree in chemistry biology and psychology and I've done everything from autopsies to xeroxing I was a forensic chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration in San Francisco where we analyze drugs from all over the world and we took down meth labs I spent seven years as a chemist criminalist with the North Metro drug task force that is the task force that handles this area we handled all of atoms in Broomfield County and as y'all know all we did was drug investigations so I've been on thousands and thousands of drug deals and drug busts I personally been involved with the processing of well over 250 meth labs I am a recognized expert all over the state when it comes to manufacturing meth health effects chemical contamination child abuse parental issues all that fun kind of stuff I left the task force the thing is coming up on like 6 years now and I'm just out doing a nationwide training I have a non-profit where I receive funding from foundations to specifically go in schools and talk to kids talk to school staff talk to parents and that's what I spend a majority of my time doing now but I do do national and international conferences as well for eight years here in Colorado I train the Colorado Department of Human Services for every one that went into homes as part of their daily job duties I trained all the Realtors in Colorado regarding cleanup disclosure meth lab liability all that fun stuff when you all want to buy or sell a house now I do training with the oil industry and I am affectionately known around the state as the Martha Stewart of meth labs so if any of you guys want to go to the dark side and break bad I can break bad better than break your bad breaks bad Breaking Bad is not even making meth right thank God but yeah I can go the dark side if you want to go there so this is going to be very informal if you guys have any questions at any time don't hesitate to ask if you want to add anything at any time feel free to do that as well but we'll just get started and we are just talking everything marijuana today so as you all know marijuana is becoming a problem in Colorado so it is best that everybody get educated about it and it all starts with the marijuana plant now there are three different strands of the cannabis sativa plant and all those the plants number of people know about one is called hemp you guys know hemp hemp isn't grown for its psychoactive compounds because it doesn't have any it's grown for its strong fiber you know they make a lot of clothing out of hemp they make industrial stuff they make paper they make hammocks they make tents in all kinds of stuff and it also has some beneficial properties as far as protein and omegas so you know they have hemp protein powder now they have hemp seeds that are really good they have hemp milk you can buy hemp lotion like and then they have oils that you can bake with like olive oil and hemp oil I haven't tried that one yet they have ham toothpaste at hemp deodorant they have hemp everything and hemp doesn't have any active cannabinoids in it the other to do and one is called indica and indica has a high amount of CBD and that stands for cannabidiol and a little bit of THC that's tetrahydrocannabinol the psychoactive ingredient that makes people feel high and Indic indica is most used by people who use marijuana medicinally and the most prominent strand of marijuana that everybody knows here in Colorado is called Charlotte's Web have you heard of Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web is the form of marijuana the strand of marijuana that the brothers down at the realm of caring in Colorado Springs who have a big medical marijuana dispensary they grow it extract out CBD and then sell it to parents whose kids have intractable seizures have you heard that and so that's where that strand comes from it's used medicinally now the first girl that they gave it to that it helped that would they named the plant after her her name was Charlotte and so they did name it after her the interesting thing about this CBD marihuana in Charlotte's Web is they have been looking at indica strands with seizures across the u.s. and children's hospitals for the last three and a half years and they are finding exactly what we're seeing here in Colorado and that is less than why third get positive benefit from this if they're having seizures that means two-thirds get worse or have no change and so some kids it does help and it's used medicinally I know a lot of people use it medicinally here in colorado from ms with their muscle spasticity you know it locks their muscles cerebral palsy is another one it relaxes the muscles it's more sedating and it's known as the body plant because it helps a little with pain helps with relaxing muscles and some other things people use it with chemotherapy and cancer because cancer just tears everything up the chemotherapy kills every living cell and every bad cell in the body and that's very painful THC helps them keep the food down does something to the vomiting mechanism and so they keep food down stays in their stomach body gets nourished from nutrients and they seem to get better so the indica plant does have a lot of medicinal promise to it and it is used by a number of people and here in Colorado in worldwide the other type of plant though that most of society wants it's called the sativa plant and that plant has a high amount of THC in it tetrahydrocannabinol and a little bit of CBD in it now when you look at the marijuana plant as a whole there are like 70 different cannabinoids in the plant only right now they've identified I think it's right around eight that have any sort of psychoactive or active properties that show benefit or harm so we have a lot more to go as far as understanding this plant has over 600 chemicals in it and many of them have not been identified yet so it all starts with that marijuana plant and exactly how they're growing it and so what people don't understand today is the marijuana today is unlike the marijuana we have ever seen before it is nothing like the marijuana that's out there when I was a kid none like the marijuana that is out there most people were kids here in the room and certainly nothing similar to as little as ten years ago today marijuana has become genetically modified meaning they take the different strands of marijuana and they clone them and create hybrids so they'll take one strand of indica and this is what the brothers at the realm of Caring did they took a strand of Ind another strand of indica cloned him and created a new hybrid now this new hybrid has more CBD in the buds than the one they started with so they take that plant get another indica plant clone it new plant so they're constantly growing and changing the the plant to produce higher amounts of either CBD or THC in it and so it all starts there and so the THC is in the buds it's not in the leaves it's not in the stem it's in the bud and if you've heard of the word perps around marijuana perps it's purple and so the bud is very very pretty has anyone here ever heard of white widow or white rhino that has white fibers on the bud and it just glows that's pretty white so sometimes the name does go back to the different strands as well well the THC is in the bud it's in the trichome of the bud and this is a bud that is magnified about a million times those little glossy hook looking things they're the trichome and then these little bubbles on it is your THC and your cannabinoids and stuff so it all starts with the bud and the way they're growing it and it is very very potent today and when you look at the marijuana buds that are in Colorado now in the plant and the THC in these buds can range anywhere from 18 to 35 percent but it's constantly rising when I was a kid THC in marijuana was 2 to 3% in the 80s it got up to about 5 to 7 in 2003 it started hovering right around 14% now it is skyrocketing have you guys heard of the marijuana concentrates where they extract the THC out of the bud there's no plant material it's a concentrated THC and CBD then for the indica side the THC in these concentrates today from the sativa can be anywhere from 50 to 90% THC so should we really be consuming anything especially a drug that's 80 or 90% pure no and that's a lot of the problem today this stuff is so potent we don't have any science on it we have no idea what to expect because it's nothing like when we were kids you know you have to look back on to see how it affected society and we just don't have any data on as potent as it today and so we're kind of rolling with it as we go along and so people need to understand that this is just a very very potent drug and they do put the concentrates the oils and stuff in the edibles and are we hearing a lot about the edibles and the problems with edibles today yeah and it's just because it is so potent and so people need to kind of understand that this is a very very potent drug and you know it's different than we have ever seen before and so it does all start with that plant material and here's the law if you don't know what the law says the law says that you have to be 21 or older for it to be treated illegally and everyone thinks Colorado got really the criminal law we did not our criminal law is the same today as it was last year years ago and will be a year from tomorrow all Colorado did was pass a man amendment 64 and that creates limited exceptions to our criminal law so if you stay within the exceptions right here it's treated as legal but go outside of the parameters and it is still charged as an illegal drug in this state and so you know not a lot of people know that now if you're 21 or older you can possess transport purchase up to one ounce at any time if law enforcement gets but gets involved with you and you have five ounces on you you're going to get arrested accordingly because you're outside of the parameters of the law and it is treated as illegal Colorado says you can grow six plants two of which can be mature at a time and this is kind of crazy part of the law and I wouldn't be surprised if it does get blown up because one how do you regulate everybody growing their own marijuana can you do it no and so Colorado's become the distribution hub for black-market illegal marijuana in the u.s. right now specifically because of this law because everybody just grows and people come out of from out of state to grow and then they try to send it back home and do and so it just creates a whole lot of issues and so that part of the law is a change in you can possess edibles you can possess oils and Colorado says that you cannot use it out in Plainview areas open to the general public donor manner that endangers others so people do get arrested for using it in public it's just a matter of having enough people to enforce it some of the times yes I he said except in Boulder actually believe it or not Boulder wrote more tickets last year than the next closest city yeah they do fully enforce this smoking in public Denver wrote an amendment to the amendment and actually allows you to sit out on your front porch and smoke it in plain view but that's the only city that wrote an amendment so yeah so it's all about knowing the law and people always say well how come they can have 4/20 and how come you can go to a concert and they smoke it well you know how many people were down at 4:20 last year I get 80,000 people were there 80,000 cops know and so you know it's just control it is what it is and so it just comes to the point where there's so many people using and not enough to enforce it that you they just try to contain it yes ma'am the question is is does manner that endangers others have to do with secondhand smoke or other things and you know I'm not sure exactly how they defined that I know that you know people can smoke in the privacy of their own home and it becomes a very big problem when they live in a condominium or an apartment complex and it has shared ventilation and then it gets into the other people's buildings and it becomes a big issue and so I'm not sure exactly how they have been enforcing endanger others I know that there's no child endangerment yet they had a great law that they tried to pass and it got shut down so they're gonna try it again so I'm not really sure what that all encompasses on a manners that endangers others does anybody here know do you have any idea with the courts question so yeah I think it's kind of broad and until you people actually until you have municipalities actually enforcing it and setting some case law around it I think it's going to continue just to be vague and people interpret it how they will and so there is a part of the law and then the other part of the law says cannot use marijuana in any form and operate a vehicle if you do you get a DUI D Drive encoder the influence of an illegal drug now Colorado did pick a number and the number is five nanograms of active THC in the system it is a blood test and they can only test for active THC what's interesting about the five nanograms is the science shows that impairment starts at two nanograms and so everyone in people in Colorado are concerned that we're well above that impairment limit and so if you look at the number of deaths driving under the influence accidents in Colorado it's up like 300% we're having a lot of issues with people driving while they're high thinking that it doesn't impair them at all and then it does create a whole lot of issues so I think that will drop down because the legislators do have the right to change it and the other two states that have a limit with driving have it set at two nanograms so we do have a limit you're not supposed to be driving after consumption and people do get arrested in large numbers in this state for doing so which obviously puts a big drain on a lot of our resources and and other things as well so that's a part of the law there too and just to show you how different the laws are here in Colorado you can grow six plants Washington said no Colorado has the high in concentrates Washington said no medical marijuana is allowed in Colorado Washington said no Washington had medical marijuana dispensaries until the day it was legalized and then all that went by the wayside and really that is the way it should be because if it is all about enforcement and taxation and regulation you don't need all these medical facilities as well and so that is a big problem in Colorado because if you look at the number of marijuana dispensaries in marijuana facilities the edible places the grill places all that there are over five hundred in Colorado right now 194 are in Denver alone and that is a problem because is marijuana easily accessible to kids today very accessible and when it's very accessible where does use go up or down it goes up and we're at one of the highest rates of marijuana use here in Colorado and when perception of or when use goes up where's our perception of harm go up or down down and we're at one of the lowest points with marijuana being perceived as just but now and innocent you know it's from Mother Earth and all it's not as bad for you is that thing called alcohol and so you know this is kind of a big problem it's used to skyrocketing and everyone think it's thinks it's safe and that could be anything but true so that has a lot to do with it as well the availability is a big problem but look what Washington State did they said 60 for the entire state and eight in Seattle and their law is very different you don't smell any marijuana anywhere around there shops here in Colorado you know you can drive down a section of i-25 and be stoned by the time you get through it and so you know it is just different here and people need to understand it I need to get Alaska's up here because they just legalized it as well I believe the first weekend to this month and so I've got to get that up here too but you can see how the the law is kind of differ but our big one is is having medical marijuana because that just makes it so much more available with all of these things now here's the impact of marijuana here in Colorado and this is from Haida Rocky Mountain Haida that's a the agency that gathers all of our data around drug use and and studies and stuff that they do we rank number fourth in the nation and teen drug use twelve to seventeen year olds we are 39 percent higher than the national average for marijuana use are related exposures to accidental ingestion by kids is skyrocketing school expulsion czar just out of the roof crime drug driving incidences hospital visits treatment facilities are swamped and it's all due to marijuana and in Colorado when they ask the resource officers about what's going on in the school 89% of them said they have seen a huge increase with marijuana since it was legalized and so we have a number of problems with this yes he asked about the crime regarding regarding marijuana that's going on in the state you know for a while we saw a lot of these dispensaries being robbed people that were growing in their own homes being robbed I know they're getting ready to release some new information around studies and stuff been looking at specifically in Colorado around crime and so off the top of my head I don't know how many burglaries how many of this how many that murders those sorts of things murders probably aren't up there by those sorts of things so does that make sense does anybody know I've heard that they're getting ready to release a lot of new information here coming out around a lot of this data so does that make sense I know we had a lot of incidences with robberies and houses being robbed and people being beat up because it's a cash-only business and so they're getting cash they're getting the drugs and then going from there but we have seen obviously drug driving accidents go way up you know deaths from that as well does that make sense did you have the same question one two and three you know I honestly don't know I just pulled this from the Rocky Mountain hider and I was mad because they didn't list it I would guess probably Oregon is always up there probably California and and Hawaii I don't know yeah I would get I don't know if Y has medical maybe Washington State you know when you look at per capita you know it could be a smaller state - so yes that is what their the question was is crime increased in Colorado since the legalization of marijuana and I think that's what they're looking at there are some studies that say yes it has and there are some studies that say no it hasn't and so they're getting to ready to release more information because part of the problem is they just don't gather data properly around this when they say a crime they write the crime and they may not put as a result of someone being under the influence of marijuana or drunk or stuff like that does that make sense so a lot of the data gathering is kind of skewed and lacking is a bigger word and so I think they're getting ready to try to figure all this out and there are groups in Denver and Denver is looking at this specifically because they're you know they have so many dispensaries they're really having a lot of problems does that answer the questions so you know we're always learning with this and more and more information is coming out but when you look at medical marijuana there's no difference between medical marijuana recreational marijuana and illegal marijuana being sold on the black market marijuana is marijuana is marijuana the old medical peace only has to do with the law Colorado is one of the think it's up to 23 states now that use or allow their citizens to use marijuana medicinally so it is only just a law the drug itself it's all the same here's our law right here it's not a recommendation it's a prescription and you're supposed to have eight different ailments but one of the ailments is general pain which is huge and so a lot of things fall under that you can possess now two ounces of marijuana instead of one and the biggest thing is is you don't have a 25% tax that recreational has so it is cheaper and so more and more people are getting medical cards and you're losing out on the taxation piece of the recreational so it is just the law and the the medical law is a totally separate law than amendment 64 and they don't really have a whole lot to do with each other and so there's the medical law but the thing about it is everyone gets really upset because marijuana is a schedule one drug under federal law which means it's treated at the same level as heroin and and ecstasy and some other drugs and the only reason that it is listed as such is because you can't dose the plant material for something to be considered outside of a Schedule one drug under federal law you have to be able to dose it and you actually you have to have data on how much of a dose is for medicinal use does that make sense and so when you look at the marijuana plant every but on the plant is different every strand of marijuana has a different amount in the buds so you can't just pull a marijuana button and say okay this is exactly how much is there because there's too many variables does that make sense now do we are getting more and more data around marijuana as medicine but you know until within the last 2 or 3 years every study looking at marijuana was all about harm not one study has been done looking at marijuana as medicine and so we need a lot more data in this state the governor did open up about 9 million dollars a few years ago for the doctors in this state to start specifically looking at marijuana as medicine and they have started doing it around the world to their you know trying to figure out you know what is it in the plant that makes it beneficial you know what is you know not helping some people and why and so we do need a whole lot more studies around this but like I said earlier the CBD the cannabinoid is showing a lot of medicinal promise and it's just going to be a matter of time before we get any data to figure it all out but what a lot of people don't understand is we already have a number of prescription drugs out there that have the marijuana compounds in them and one is marinol that's been a pill that's been around forever was very popular in the 80s with AIDS people would be giving it to them to help keep food down so that they could start to feel better a lot of people didn't like it though because it's a pill and as soon as you swallow a pill they'd be vomiting it back up and so you know this one we do have a lot of data about it's called Marinol and those are the things that it kind of relieves there well they came out with a film strip that dissolves on the tongue because people were complaining about swallowing a pill because it came right back up and this seems to work as well for pain and nausea and also some information on fibromyalgia and then there's Sativex which we're waiting this isn't its third human study here in the United States it's gone through animal studies it is already a prescription drug in all other parts of the world here in the US we're waiting for it to clear but they say it will very very soon and it's a breast spray that you just spray on your tongue and this stuff actually comes from a doctor in Israel who's been growing all different strands of marijuana and extracting out different cannabinoids and doing Studies on them and so this stuff is derived straight from the cannabis plant these two are synthetics and so they're trying to see does that benefit as well and it is showing a lot of promise with muscle spasticity some pain and then some people are having benefit with seizures so there are prescription marijuana compounds out there that our prescription drug and the good thing about it is we have data on it the stuff that the guy down in Colorado Springs prescribes and other people go and get it and use it medicinally we don't have a lot of data as to exactly how all that is look and so there's no controlled studies around it people just go and buy and use it for pain and it helps her doesn't you know nausea it helps her doesn't so there are prescriptions out there that do have THC and other cannabinoids in it and so here's an interesting fact that a lot of people don't understand about marijuana is it THC is our only fat-soluble drug meaning it doesn't like your bloodstream it likes your body fat so after you smoke it or you vape it or you drink it in a soda or eat it in a cookie THC gets in the bloodstream travels around the whole body and your body fat sucks it up your organ fat sucks it up and your brain fat sucks it up as well and you can see the more often you use the longer it can stay there and so it's usually a good 30 days sometimes longer but now daily use at least three times a day every day really pumps that number up and so this is the one drug that you can fail a drug test on longer than any other drug out there and you know that creates a problem in the area for of employment because both our medical marijuana law and amendment 64 both state and the law employers don't have to accommodate your use of marijuana in the workplace period and so people would go to work high and they'd go to work with their card and say you can't fire me I'm medicating and they were promptly fired and a lot of those people sued and it did set case law in Colorado and it says that employers have the right to refuse to hire and can fire will anyone using marijuana medicinally recreationally or otherwise in the workplace and that goes for showing up high or failing a random drug test and so this one you have a high probability of failing a random days later because of the way it is stored in your body fat so you know everything about this drug is different there's your duration your high how long you can stay in your system but it is our fat soluble drug and the fat soluble piece of it is the active THC being broke down into the carboxylic acid form of THC and that is what's stored in the fat and so with the driving thing all they can test for is active THC and it has to be a blood test this is urine and it's that fat soluble form of THC and there's a problem with employment not only in Colorado but really across the nation with this drug now here are the different types of material and we'll talk about it and how they consume it obviously you know the plant material yes the question is the duration of the highest two to three minutes and does our high-end THC in these products today increase the duration of the high or just make it more intense okay so the answer is yes to both of those it gets very very intense and it can last longer you see a lot more agitation and other things that we never saw before so the duration of high can be longer and much more intense because of the potency does that make sense it could they say you know I've read some conflicting things some things have said six hours with active THC some have said nine or ten they say usually by 24 hours after you last consumed it it should be well below you know two nanograms even at the higher concentrations because once it gets into the system our body starts to break it down and that's when it breaks it into the add to the carboxylic acid that's stored in the fat does that make sense so yeah but it is it can be much longer and and just come on very very fast and different today so those are different forms and we'll talk about them now this is your marijuana concentrates that they extract out a lot of them extract it out with butane if you guys heard of butane hash oil extractions house was blown up from it because butane is extremely volatile they're about three or four different types of ways that you could extract it butane is very fast but it's very flammable and a lot of house was blow up because of it here's your BHO they call a butane honey oil and that is what they will put in the edibles as well it can be a wax in a gooey and waxy looking stuff and they say the more yellow or translucent it is the higher the THC a lot of times they'll take the wax and spread it out on cheesecloth and then it dries a little bit and then they peel off these big pieces and that's called shatter and they call it chat or bless you because it breaks it shatters and you could drop it in and shatters it's very very potent stuff here's the hashish and the Keith and usually how they make that today is they'll buy the mirror buy marijuana usually the buds crush it up put it or it couldn't even put it in hole in a big five gallon bucket and throw in a piece of dry ice and then put a piece of cheesecloth over it and put a rubber band or some rope or something around it to hold it very tight and the dried ice starts freeze drying that resin off and they turn it upside down and shake it then they get a really really fine green powder and then they collect it all up and you can put it in moulds they'll collect it all up and start rolling it and your body heat starts getting a gooey and so they'll roll balls of it sometimes but it's very very concentrated it's not like you know when I was a kid has she looked like dirt with plant material in it it doesn't look like that today if anyone older here in the rooms remembers that it was very it's very different than it looks today this is very very potent stuff and they do call it dabs because the dab will do you they say one puff of this potent stuff equals smoking two full joints so it is very very potent and I talked to kids and adults all the time they say yeah once you start dabbing you know smoking the flour just a joint just doesn't do it for you anymore so it is very potent I'll pass this stuff around you guys can look at it I bought it down in the pot shops a bunch of cops and I were checking things out they wanted to test some of this stuff and so we went down and bought a bunch of it this stuff is called butter and it looks like plumber's putty but if you put your hand and put some in your hands and roll it your body heat makes it real gooey and sticky and then you could smoke it in a vaporizer and then here's the really really high-end stuff it won all kinds of awards and this is your shatter and it's got kind of warm and stuck to the wall here but you can see right through it it's very very potent stuff so that's what some of the concentrates in the state that look like and then they smoke it in the vaporizers or vapes the e-cigarettes the hookah here's a vaporizer all these were given to me by a school schools are taking them out of out of the schools like crazy middle schools high schools this is a vaporizer and it got broken it got think I had some counselors that were really excited at the first training after they gave it to me and they all got broke but it has this little thing on it and you can get some wax concentrate and just roll a little ball on there and then put the top piece on and it doesn't all go together because it got broken shouldn't get it to go and then you just push the button that heats it and then it vaporizes it and they smoke it out the top the question is does it have the same smell as marijuana not always you know it makes just a vapor they push the button and breathe it in here's the e-cigarette or another vaporizer hookah pan you know they can use these hookah pens and stuff they can buy the e drops that are flavored to put in here and they have vegetable iliyan vegetable oil is fatty THC is fatty fat fat like fat so they put it in here push the button light turns on you can hear crackling and then they smoke it and when they exhale if it smells like orange like this one smells like orange the odor coming out is orange odor so you don't always get a marijuana smell with it a lot of times you'll get like a fruity smell or another smell because if they're putting the liquid in the drop in the drops then it you know all kind of just doesn't smell like marijuana so I'll pass these around and what a lot of kids will do here's another one this one does smell like orange you can push the button it works it cracks it's almost burned out from people testing it but the schools tell me all the time that kids will smoke these when they have a substitute teacher a lot of times or in the classroom until the teachers catch on but they'll wear a watch or they'll wear a hoodie and they'll sit like this in class and very little smoke and they're smoking in the classrooms and so you know people smoke these at the airport they smoke them while they're driving they smoke them all over town everywhere that you can think of in the hospitals and so you know it doesn't leave a lot of marijuana odor to it and so that's a way to disguise it too so there's another vape and you guys can look at them take them apart play with them do whatever so all these are out there this is a vaporizer - why would they make it look like an inhaler to disguise it right and I know a number of kids in the high schools who get harassed because they actually have asthma and they're seen taking a hit of it after a gym class and then they SRO and the security team is down pulling him out calling their parents calling the doctor calling the pharmacy to confirm that it's really for asthma so all kinds of things go on you can get them rechargeable here this is from high school took it out of the kids pocket and gotten a whole lot of trouble here's the hookah pens that you could smoke it into the e-cigarettes that you take apart you can smoke it in they can smoke it out of bonds or bubblers as they call them they call them oil rigs dab pipes they have a little nail look and things on them and they'll heat that nail with a blowtorch and then just hit that waxy stuff on it and vaporizes very very quickly and then they breathe it in you know suck it in via whatever liquid there and then just blow it out so you know these dab pipes and Oilers are very very popular as well here's a homemade one that looks really funky I figure if you got money for Greg Greg goose you might as well you know make a nice marijuana pipe out of it and so a lot of homemade things as well that you'll see but these are their oil rigs or their bubblers that they smoke these high end concentrates in and then as far as the edibles you know it is everything that you can think of and we're going to talk about these as well and these edibles first started in the medical marijuana dispensaries and one thing about medical marijuana the science does show to get benefit from it you need to eat it the ingesting works so much better you know smoking you know smoking everything we know is bad for you so eating it is the big thing and so it did start in the marijuana dispensaries but the thing about it is all this stuff is supposed to be tested in Colorado in the recreational pot shops from seed to finish product for THC content for mold for fungus bacteria for pesticides if they're growing the marijuana and dirt they has to have to test it for soil contaminants as well well they're just now starting to get the labs up and operating 15 months into this so we haven't had a lot of testing like should have been done from day one and so you don't really know what kind of contaminants are in this marijuana and medical marijuana does not have that standard which I think they should especially if we're going to extract it out and give it to parents to give to their little kids for seizing shouldn't we be able to tell a parent a hundred percent of what's in there we should and that's a different law and so you know medical marijuana does not have the same standards as recreationally and we're still trying to get to this fully up and operating and enforced and regulated the way it needs to be regulated and so let's look at states that actually do testing okay here's would the information that Washington released in the last six months a legalization they found 13 percent of their pot had equalized Salmonella and mold in it is E coli and Salmonella good for us no their deadly bacteria but at least they are testing and they can get it off the market and not ever allow it on the market through testing Colorado it's used to be where California did testing and they found less THC than the products claimed 40 percent had mold and mildew and 15 percent of the oils had benzene what is benzene benzene is a cancer-causing chemical and not good for us humans and so you know we still have a long way to go and we need to get this testing done but right now it seems to be wetter and it was passed in the law because it is a safety a health and safety issue they're supposed to be well and potency they don't have for testing but you have to tell them how much THC is in the product does that make sense and so I'll show you that in just a minute and walk you through it because that all changed just recently - with the change in the law does that answer your question so yeah so we'll get with potency and figuring it out and so we do have deaths associated now with marijuana use so we've had a number of them and these are the two first ones that happened that went worldwide the one where the 19 year old kid came down eat a marijuana cookie he got very agitated his friends took him back to the hotel tried to calm him down he got agitated went to the balcony and jumped off and they were four stories up and it was the fall and hit on the ground that killed him but when they released his toxicology he had like 600 milligrams of THC in his system and so you know is it one cookie is it multiple cookies was he vaping well we'll never know and so a sad story and then another sad story that you guys probably remember the guy down in Denver who was on eating marijuana caramels got agitated his wife is on the phone with a Denver dispatch 9-1-1 for 12 full minutes and they never responded the last thing you hear is a blood-curdling scream and a gunshot and he shot his wife at point-blank range in front of the kids and so we're starting to hear about that that was just on the news I think on Friday they said the guy's pleading not guilty in his case is set for June or July and so the grandparents filed a lawsuit because the kids are you know obviously never going to be the same and so you know we'll see what happens but we do have a number of deaths here in Colorado regarding marijuana is it's the marijuana are they getting some chemicals that we have no idea what they are and so until we get things tested and regulated we're really kind of rolling with it as we go now the thing about marijuana edibles is obviously there's probably an inconsistency in the concentration but any time you eat a product it's time delayed whether you're popping prescription pills or having a marijuana cookie or an edible or pop and Molly tea you know it's got to go through the entire digestive tract into the lower intestine and then it pops out into the bloodstream and that can take a good 30 to 60 minutes but people don't know that and so they'll eat some of these edibles not feel what they think they should be feeling and what do they do they eat more and that is the worst thing you could do because now you're double dosing and that is a huge huge problem the information needs to get out on how to consume marijuana and we don't have a lot of science on eating marijuana we don't have any science and what happens when you put THC in food and cook it or start mixing it with other things there's no science around that at all and so we just need a lot more information but it is a time-delayed thing people do eat more and then by the time it comes to fruition all kinds of craziness starts going on so there's some information about the edibles and here are some of the edibles now when I say edible I want you guys to think of every food product that you can think of because that's exactly what it is it's everything they take the THC oil they mix it with butter they call it butter and they take that butter and they make cookies and candies and cakes and pie and ice cream and yogurt in chocolate truffles I was in one place they were popping popcorn and drizzle and shades they bought on the popcorn and people were buying bags of popcorn and eating it it is everything you can think of it is every drink then now make beer and coffee along with energy drinks tea juices sodas it is everything that you can think of have you heard of people having pot Luck's where they put the pot in the pot look have you heard about those kinds of stories around that and so you know there's even a chef I guess who gave up her job somewhere else in in the US and comes here and on the weekends does these THC infusion parties where she makes high-end meals and infuses it all with marijuana and they pay a hefty price to go there so you know it could be absolutely anything and for those of you that are 21 or older in this room I would strongly recommend you go visit a pot shop because you can you need to see exactly what goes on in there it will blow your mind the stuff that they have in there and how it is so marketed to our kids and so you need to go in them to see what is available because the kids know the kids know more about marijuana today than their parents and it's hard for parents to have a conversation with them especially when the parents think it's all you know a wacky weed man it was so fun it didn't hurt anybody was eyes in college well that's the stuff today and so you need to go into a pot shop to see really what it's all about so it is absolutely everything and they can infuse products meaning they take products that people recognize and then infuse it and resell it a lot of times it smells of marijuana sometimes you don't know until you taste it it's going to taste a little weird so you know it could be anything and you know they don't change the look of it so you know it is stuff that people recognize and and then it cost a pretty penny so those are just some of them but now let's go through ones that I actually bought in the pot shops here's one and they sold me a medical product and that's kind of not supposed to be going on in the recreational pot shops recreational has very very specific things that have to be on that label and at the time of buying this on they do all buy some new ones that was not being enforced or followed now it says you can have a hundred milligrams of activated THC and until May of last year they passed the law but it went into the effect I think earlier this month it was you could have a maximum of 100 milligrams of THC in any product total so that that kind of answers a little bit of your question earlier when you asked about testing for it so that is the maximum amount they can put in any product now the word activated is on there because that lets people know that THC has been activated so if they eat it they're going to get high okay and to get high you have to heat THC to activate it hence smoking vaping baking stirring in really hot butter activates THC and so even though it's going to be lukewarm or cold you know or it's a soda that I'm drinking if the THC is activated I'm gonna get stoned makes sense now I say that because this is a medicinal product and people that truly use marijuana medicinally do they want to be stoned out of their mind no so there are products that you can buy that don't have the word activated on it and that tells people that they're not going to get high that's going to be more of a sedating kind of thing does that make sense and so that's just a code word well that's all fine and good but according to the law you can have more than 10 milligrams per serving so this has a hundred milligrams total this should say somewhere on the label this is ten servings you need to divide that into ten pieces does that happen no and especially when you read the labeling says dosage suggestion is one-half to one CRISPR three hours or as needed so if they follow the guidance of the dosage and they eat half of it could they be in trouble but if they don't feel the effects you know 20 30 40 minutes in what do they do eat the other half and then are they going to have problems probably so start to see some of the problems here and what we're dealing with with these edibles is we have to get people educated it is time-delayed and it needs to be cut into pieces or you need to be told you know have one tenth of this start with a little bit and then if you like it then certainly have a little more yes oh couch lock people that smoke pot are they very motivated not always right so they're sitting just on the couch just zonin couch lock is what they call it have you kids heard of couch lock so it's just a code word that it makes them really lazy I guess would be a good way to put it and so you know that product is out there here's another fun one they take the Czechs mix the muddy buddies and they spray it with THC oil and then they repackage it up as buddy mix and this bag says a hundred milligrams total of THC so how many servings should it be there's nothing on there about eat a tenth of this and so I'll pass this around see if it has any odor to it used to stink oh yeah you can still get a little odor of marijuana it smells like chocolate and peanut butter as well but you guys can open it up that's some of it there and you can see how the color all the sugar unis is kind of going away because they spray it with the THC oil so you're going to get a little marijuana odor it's probably going to taste weird too as you get that oil so there's another one out there here's a fun one Pixy Stix and so if the labels not on here is your kid gonna know are you gonna have a clue no and so when you look at it there was less than a tablespoon of sugar in here when I took it out it smells a tiny bit like marijuana it smelled like blueberry sugars fried as more of a marijuana smell now as people have been opening it and shaking it but the bad news is that says 75 milligrams so this is seven and a half servings did you divide your Pixy Stix and seven no I would eat seven Pixy Stix when I was a kid so you can open that and smell it and read the label here's another fun one do you have a clue you got a guess right if it's in the bowl at a party do you have a clue no and so all I did was buy some get a bag of swedish fish put it out take him out and go all this guy does I call him mr. ed appear he buys every hairbow candy and I mean every hairbow candy sprays it with THC oil repackages it and sells it so these reek of marijuana the odors kind of gone down but it smelled like a skunk and codeword for marijuana today is skunk because it smells so got awfully bad and so it would just knock you over when you open these so you are going to get an odor to it and I'll pass these around you guys can open it up smell it here's the fish I'll pass around some other candies as well there's some gummies bears that's two servings the real Pere supposed to be five that says 100 milligrams 1010 milligram pieces so one fish is one serving there's only does do people only one fish no anybody that knows anything with swedish fish is a bag is a serving and so you know it becomes a problem thank you for waiting and you don't and until they get the testing set and really start regulating it I don't know that we're going to know but yeah it is potent potent stuff that they spray on there you know probably 8090 percent THC and then how you know do they spray it the same way every time does everyone have their own little procedure does you know somebody do it real carefully and one just goes you know spray over we don't know any of that and so you know we just need more you know information and really need to regulate this and get it under control was that kind of your question - I saw your head your hand up yeah and if it's not being tested there you know have that has that been confirmed through testing right and so yeah does he have a lot of caution on it oh so he does put it on okay good interesting yeah the marijuana product something we'll get one of the kids to read it yeah yeah and it's supposed to have specific labeling on don't use it and drive don't use if you're pregnant it's kind of gone away it really smelled I'll have to go buy some new ones yes the question is if they were to eat all of it instead of the proper serving size and especially the little kid got a hold of it could it be lethal and create a lot of problems then it does and I'll show you how the law changed here and why and it's specifically because the doctors at Children's Hospital because the number of kids that were getting accidental exposure and being put in the intensive care unit and admitted to Children's Hospital treatment providers tell me all the time treatment doctors detox doctors tell me all the time that a lot of these people are really struggling and so many of them are taking up beds in the detox facilities for days with marijuana because of this high potency THC can give them psychosis and antipsychotics don't touch it xanax doesn't touch it a lot of issues with a racing heart the heart races anywhere from 20 to 100 times it should within shortly after consuming and can last for three hours and so you know we see a lot of negative effects that we never saw before so like I said at the beginning we're kind of rolling with it but we know that it's creating a lot of problems in and it and it does put a huge bill on the medical community you know on that that's an interesting thing the question is can it kill you and I can tell you that if you saw the corner on TV after the kid jumped off the balcony she said that they're believing more and more that you can overdose if you ingest it and she wrote right on the death certificate I guess that THC you know she wrote that it was fall to the ground whatever blunt-force impact or whatever it's called on the death certificate due to marijuana use now I know that THC is not an option on a death certificate so in my opinion how can you really say that if it's not an option things that are an option is heroin cocaine alcohol heart attacks stroke cancer those are things that are on there and marijuana and THC is not and so how do you really gauge that and so you know to answer your question is all I know is that more and more doctors are saying they think that now that it might be possible but it's not an option on a death certificate does that make sense so yeah and we're seeing you know deaths associated with it so yeah so you know time will tell right but do they know they're supposed to eat you know one tenth of the cupcake no but I can tell you those candies that went around the mist right up here that was like $28 the the first thing I showed you that rice krispies treat thing I think that was like 32 I got more candy to send around that it was right around there but you know a good chunk of it was 25% tax to the marijuana the high-end concentrate back there the wax was $100 for that little bit and so you know it is expensive but that tax puts a big chunk on it as well does that make sense yeah yeah yeah but you know put your money in and if they know so yeah did you have another question or is that similar no okay all right so yeah so there's that here's another fun one this one's a little easier to tell that's definitely a peanut butter cup but you know again proper labeling packaging all that mein shirts in a childproof container all that becomes an issue but the bad news ten servings you're gonna divide that nine and have someone lick the knife probably not and so here it is I'll pass it rounds kind of it really it didn't smell it smelled like candy until we broke it open bro little chunks off the side just to test it with the cops so you will get a marijuana odor I'll pass it around for you guys to look at here's some caramels and the reason I bought this one is because it's the only one that the labeling is actually correct yeah the ones I bought it tells you how many servings and everything about it if you dare you can open it up and reach in here it smells of marijuana it's got oil everywhere this gets soft in my car these are two pieces that kind of stuck together each piece is five servings and so this is here but it is the proper labeling and it says so all over it so now I get all that oil on you so there's that one well that's ten servings the THC here's your ten servings of peanut butter cups and if you eat ten servings of either are you going to have a few problems a tiny bit right so you guys see the problems that it's creating now the law change last May and it was forced by the doctors at Children's Hospital because in the first two years medical marijuana dispensaries were open there were fourteen kids under the age of twelve that had accidentally ingestion of these edibles and they were taken to Children's Hospital eight of those kids were admitted to the hospital two were putting the intensive care unit and the youngest child was eight months old prior to this being available in our medical marijuana dispensaries is where all the edibles started there were zero through the history of time but these edibles are they marketed to kids they are and so the law is supposed to change and the new law says now that you can only sell ten milligrams you can only sell one serving and if you make something that is more than one sir you have to cut it into the proper pieces packages package it up label it you can only sell ten milligrams one serving at a time well the law went farther and said you need to color it and make it distinguishable because I showed you guys once you take it out any of it out of the package do you have a clue no and so they're supposed to color it and when I was down there the legislators kept saying let's make it an ugly gray and you know they want to make it so it's not appealing to kids they went as far as saying well let's put an insignia right on the Edible itself because once you take it out of the packaging you can't tell but if you have this gray thing and it's got a little red X or a little green marijuana leaf on it now you can tell little kids do you see this thing you don't eat it you tell mommy and daddy you leave you get out of there you tell teenagers because it's showing up at parties like crazy are the edibles showing up at parties they are showing up like crazy at parties and so you can know if you see this you know it has a drug in it it comes from the dispensaries and they're saying if you can't color it and put an insignia on it you can't sell it but that has yet to happen in fact they are fighting it big time tooth and nail and they don't want to have to color these because it's going to cost money but I believe more importantly it's less appealing to the kids and so you know I can't remember the last time I bought a pixie stick and I am NOT in two gummies so you know whose it really marketed to and so that's the way the law is supposed to be but they are getting huge kickback they have changed it and made it ten milligrams per serving one serving per packet but the colorization and the identification has yet to happen and they are fighting it tooth and nail this week there's going to be a big hearing down with the legislators all around what are we going to do with this because the law says one thing but they are not enforcing it or you know doing what they need to do so when you hear about these edibles the products really are everything that again you can think of they have patches that people wear and some people do wearing wear medicinally and get them in the recreational shops pills you can get the mints you can get lotions and tinctures you can get oil you can get honey you can get butter everything and so that's why you guys need to go into these shops just to see everything that's out there but my favorite is this this has 21 milligrams of THC in it and really what is the purpose it smells smell it it smells just like chapstick it has cinnamon err peppermint oil in it very high-end ingredients everything organic and this goes around the schools they take the label off and kids pass it around and put it on their lips and here we go what really is the purpose of having marijuana in your lip balm anybody you know I'd love an explanation money what kissing yeah there you go so yeah so you know it is everything and so you guys need to check this out but so many different products out there and it's really a smorgasbord and just more and more people you know coming here to open these businesses to make even more and more and more so all this goes on out there and it's every product you can think of now here's some of your short term in and long-term effects and you know drugs can really be across the board on everything with this one we do see the basic you know the laziness the the increase in appetite the very dry mouth feeling better real relaxed we do see stimulant type effects where the heart race is out of control very very agitated it does impair their coordination as well and you see anxiety and confusion short term with this as well and then the long term issues and this stuff was presented to the legislators just a few weeks ago saying that it does impair the Mental Status specifically learning memory math and reading achievement even 28 days after they stop using and then the psychosis the agitation panic attacks just behavior that we have never seen before so there's some of your short and long-term and I sent a handout to do and I think Carolyn so if you guys want it you can email me I'll send it to you or do you have it for them you can send it them or so yeah so you can send it out and it has all of the information and all the science and all the data on it as well and here's your short and long term effects but again everybody's affected differently what are you using how are you using it how much you're using what is in it all these sorts of things all kind of play a role now here's your indicators marijuana use and these are just a number of them and you can see here lack of conversions they can't cross their eyes they get the reddening of the eyes now they have to call out a d-r-e expert a drug recognition expert to figure out if they are under the influence for adults here in Colorado they'll look at you know airs and judgment changing emotions erratic behavior you know people have an I don't care attitude with marijuana and I think anytime you deal with anybody high on any drug it can be a safety issue because you really never know how anyone is really going to react or respond and so I think it's always better just to wait until people come down off the drug and then deal with them so there are some of your indicators and all that again is on the handout now there's a lot of science very very solid science around marijuana and we're not going to talk about all this today just due to time but it is all in the handout as far as chronic use with marijuana today and the solid scientific studies but we will talk about a few of them and the first thing we're going to talk about is the brain now in our head we have what's called an endocannabinoid system and it's a very very very valuable part of our brain and our brain releases endocannabinoids multiple times during the day these endocannabinoids are a very very small particulate and our brain releases a very miniscule amount and then they go throughout the bloodstream and we have c b1 c b2 and g-protein couple are in the brain and on various organs and when they bind on these receptors they flash which means they burn very very intensely and then they cause a response well one thing that they do is they get our central nervous system into homeostasis meaning gets all our chemicals into balance and you know that's very important because when your brain chemistry is out of balance that can be a very dangerous health effect it helps when we're stressed it helps when we're sick it helps with learning in memory but the number one thing it does for kids is it helps their brain grow to the size and weight it's needs to be at maturity when it's done somewhere around the age of 25 26 29 whenever that time is and so that's the natural response of our endocannabinoid system well cannabinoid those are what's in marijuana and so this is where THC CBD and all these other cannabinoids bind but it's a very very dark side with marijuana if I was in here it had you know broke open some of that pot back there and we put it in a vaporizer and we all vape some we're gonna have a large amount of THC in our bloodstream and it is going to go and it's going to bind to these receptors but is THC larger or smaller than our man-made endocannabinoids larger much larger so when they bind on these receptors they don't flash they burn for hours and the science shows that it starts damaging these receptors and the science does show that it delays brain growth and development and if you delay your brain growth and development when your brain is done you know 25 27 whenever it is does the brain go back and compensate for when you messed it up as a teenager no and so you know there is a very very dark side with marijuana and so you know there's reputable science out there and it's not looking like a real good thing especially for the developing adolescent brain now here's a picture of the brain when you cut it in half here are all the parts in the middle of our head is our reward center surrounded by our limbic system that is the midbrain and that is the only part of an adolescent brain that's fully formed it fully forms by the age of 13 the rest isn't going to be developed until about the age of 25 maybe a little later frontal lobe prefrontal cortex here in front of the head and if you could stick your fingers up above your eyes as your higher in thinking part of your brain executive functioning problem solving decision making knowing right from wrong learning the difference between good and bad learning from your mistakes judgment cognition impulse control emotions in language is up there as well and this is one of the last part of the brains brain that is fully formed it kind of goes a little slow top of the head movement sensation and motivation is the top back is vision there's a coordination that is your cerebellum that is your brainstem responsible for breathing and in the middle of our head is our hippocampus that deals with learning and memory especially working memory being able to lay down a memory and then recall that memory at a period of time later now I'm going to show you guys where THC binds in the brain so what is the only part of the brain not impaired from marijuana use it is the vision all in the back of the head here you know on THC damage these things receptor if we wrote in the law that you can't use marijuana and operate a vehicle and that's because the studies since 1950 on have shown that it doesn't pair the ability the new studies say now the higher the THC the bigger the problem and you know we talked about that how the number of drug driving incidences are up here and across the nation makes you feel good but to some people use drugs so that they don't have to feel at all maybe they have some things going on in their lives they don't know how to talk about it they're not comfortable in their own skin something's going on will drugs suppress all of those bad feelings they do so feelings have a lot to do with why people use drugs learning in memory part of the brain frontal lobe prefrontal cortex top of the brain as well and so you know the science is very very clear and there is excellent reputable science out there that has been reproduced multiple studies that are epidemiological studies and you know it impairs the frontal lobe dropsy IQ one of the studies shows drops it by an average of six to eight points in the IQ doesn't return to normal and a link between marijuana and mental illness and so you know all the studies are right there even the Journal New England Journal of Medicine came out and analyzed all the data that was out there and came up with all kinds of information on about how this is a drug that the longer kids stay away from nearly during these teen years they're better off they're going to be and so good science that's out there and it's hard to argue with science new studies showing that chronic use causes this fiery red gingivitis what it does is the immune system kind of weakens damages the the gums the gums loosen the teeth and then the teeth start falling out and if they're using a lot you know as a teenager in their early 20s even at earlier ages you think tooth loss might be older even in the teens and late teens and early 20s some can have some tooth loss as well from chronic use of this and so a lot of good information out there around how it affects different organs in the body the heart or the hyperemesis syndrome is probably the number one thing that doctors want to talk about when I do trainings with emergency room Docs and nurses it's a cyclic vomiting where it's kind of interesting because THC is supposed to prevent you from vomiting but chronic use makes these people sick in a cyclic manner and the doctors and nurses tell me all the time oh yeah every Thursday we just expect so-and-so and here he or she is and it's cyclic so they vomit every Thursday or if they only only vomit a couple times a month they vomit a couple times a month month later exact dates they're back in the hospital from vomiting from being dehydrated and so sick so there's this cyclic vomiting that goes on they say if you just give them a warm bath that kind of calms them down some anti-nausea medicine will help a little bit but this is becoming a bigger bigger problem in our emergency rooms another issue is the heart and how much the heart rate increases in the now the potential for a heart attack from this high end marijuana as well and so again a lot of new things popping up around to marijuana out there and so the heart is another thing that they want to talk about all the time when I talk to doctors and nurses is how do you calm that heart down vision is affected and they're seeing some long-term issues with that and that's because we have cb1 receptors on our retina so they say that's an extension of that endocannabinoid system that we talked about and it damages those receptors and then you have you know some colors termination sensitivity to light your acuity for things is down to and so good science around that and then the red eye that is caused from the vasodilation of the blood vessels and this occurs with smoking in vaporization it doesn't occur with the edibles when you eat it they don't get that reddening of the eye so that's the thing too is you know these edibles are so popular and you know they do deal with them in the schools and you know the you don't smell like the dopes because you're not smoking it you don't have any baggies or anything you've eaten the evidence and you don't have that very distinctive reddening of the eyes as well so that is a thing and then what they use the most with this is these roto drops which are bleached bleaching chemical in these eye drops and it's a it can you know soothe the eyes and relieve that redness for multiple hours you guys know Visine is a bleaching agent and bleaches your eyes for what maybe 10 minutes max get real white this is hour or so maybe longer and this is the number one thing they take off of kids in schools so they'll tell that their high their eyes are real white indicators and so I can pass this around you can get this stuff pretty much anywhere but there is a bleaching agent in there that is concerning to the eye doctors my eye doctor was telling me at the national conference last year they had someone presenting on marijuana and the eyes and said they're very concerned about these bleaching agents that the bleaching agents will damage the eyes permanently and they'll always have that reddening of the eye and nothing will be able to change that so they're concerned with the bleaching agents and things people are using to bleach that red out so this is just you can consider that paraphernalia that's out there that a lot of kids use here is paraphernalia and it could be absolutely anything in paraphernalia only tells us one thing and that is we have a drug user these are highlighters fake highlighters they're a pipe in the back and so you know any way that you can disguise it obviously is a big thing obviously these are marijuana pipe says are these a lot of kids will smoke pot and take an empty toilet paper roll shove it with dryer sheets and then smoke pot in their house they do it in the bathrooms at schools SRO and the security team tells me all the time they're they'll hit the pipe or take a bong hit and blow it all into the dryer sheets so a lot of heroin users do that as well it gets rid of the odor so if you see Brown dryer sheets in your house that's probably a clue especially if they're in trash with empty toilet paper rolls they will make fruit pipes as well Oh is she been busted oh good okay oh okay okay all right good to know I'll have to tell parents that from now on so yeah they make fruit pipes I don't know if you guys have seen it and they smoke every type of truck imaginable in it they'll take apples or pears in court and shove aluminum foil down near the bottom take a pen apart and shove it in there they drill a hole right and the fruit drip the dribble the dope onto the aluminum foil lighted beneath and as it goes up the core they breathe it in and then it takes on the odor of the odor of the sugar nests and the taste of the fruit so if you see banana pipe or jerry-rigged fruit that just is not normal and so that is paraphernalia so all kinds of craziness goes on paraphernalia again anything grinders rolling paper you know crack pipe some vials little containers these are high two cans and they are weighted and they feel and look look just like whatever is on the label and then you open the top or the bottom and it's all hollow inside they sell them online to hide your jewelry I have been on thousands of drug deals and I have never seen jewelry in any of them and so you can buy them in the pot shops you buy them in the smoke shops everywhere and they have everything imaginable they have the energy drinks they have beers they have sodas they have Pringles and you shake it sounds like a Pringles container and you pop the bottom and the whole insides Hollow they have a woman's hairbrush they have everything started fluid baby where I wipe I've seen green beans wd-40 everything the coolest one is the double-a battery it says Duracell double-a you pop the top and it spins and then you stack your pills on the inside of it it's acute it's a little thing you ever did see and so these are all high two cans and so you know that's a nice way to hide things this is from a high school right jerry-rigged his inhaler they will jerry-rigged it just about everything and so paraphernalia means one thing and that is that we have a drug user and so you know the bottom line is when you're dealing with people just pay attention to your senses take a good look at them you know what do you see and all are their eyes dilated or constricted are they red are they bloodshot are they grinding their teeth in are they agitated do they have some tremors you know are they shaking do they have burns on their fingertips or lips you know crack pipes will do that as well some of the inhalants cause burning especially the cold stuff do you spray that air duster you spray on your computer you know what do you smell obviously alcohol and marijuana and chemicals if they're huffing paint they smell of the chemicals that they consume that means one thing but vomit can be important because so many drugs make people sick they could be withdrawing from the drug and vomiting a lot so don't discount vomit that really could be another piece of it as well do they smell like excess perfume or aftershave kids will smear dryer sheets on their clothes to get rid of some of that odor as well and pay attention to what you hear you know are they speaking really really fast and high-pitched are they speaking very low and raspy are they talking fast are they taking a while to answer your questions you know are you asking him a question about this but they're off on a tangent over here and you can't follow the conversation if you guys just use your senses you can start to put everything together now urban dictionary is a really really good resource to have you can get it on your desktop your laptop and you can get it on all your smartphones and if you're hearing terminology that you don't understand put it in urban dictionary if it's a drug it comes up in the top three tells you what the drug is if it's laced with anything and my fave how do you use it in a sentence because we all got to know that stuff and so it's awesome Molly is not your your child's friend Molly is a designer drug it's a mix of MDMA ecstasy and bath salts today and it's dropping kids left and right one of our newest drugs on the street is called gravel and gravel is coke meth and bath salts and so if you're hearing terminology that you don't recognize just put it in urban dictionary because it'll tell you if it's a drug it'll tell you if it's for sexting or texting it'll tell you what it all means so urban dictionary really is a good resource to have if you're hearing new weird terminology today bath salts question is what are bath salts bath salts are a designer drug that is synthetically made in pharmaceutical companies most of these places are in China now when I say pharmaceutical company they're not like Pfizer Glasgow Klein Wells as we know pharmaceutical companies these are drug labs and so they are a designer drug that the chemical makeup is very similar to ecstasy methamphetamine and mescaline and then they alter the molecule they keep changing it to fly under the radar of the law and you can't charge them for it because DEA hasn't caught up yet but they are psychedelics stimulants meaning they fire up your system like coke and meth but they make you hallucinate like LSD mescaline and ecstasy there are 100 usually 98 to 100% pure and they're full synthetic and they're dropping kids left and right but they're in the ecstasy family of drugs you see a lot of similar things body temperature getting really high because of the vasoconstriction dehydrating agitated grinding the teeth they become paranoid and delusional because they're so potent that it just makes them crazy releases a lot of serotonin in their brain that makes them psychotic see things and hear things does that make sense yeah we're seeing a lot and hearing a lot about bath salts and stuff today so the other one would be the synthetic pot k2 Black Mamba spice which is man-made synthetic THC and it's coming out of the pharmaceutical companies as well other things are mixed in but it's very very potent very potent and they say it's like 1 to 300 times more potent than the THC in marijuana and it is synthetic so that causes a lot of problems too does that make sense that's a good question I get a lot about bath salts so that's all I got to say about that guys have questions some of you look like you need to run screaming into the night yeah the question is as our other drugs mixed in with marijuana and certainly they are PCP you know is always a problem all other drugs could be put in you know coke meth heroin ecstasy all other drugs could easily be put in now you're not going to get the lace stuff from a marijuana dispensary but certainly on the street forever they've had other drugs laced in marijuana why would they do it well I think a lot of times they do it to get you up to the bigger badder drugs because what do drug dealers care about do they care about you know they want the money out of your pocket and certainly there's a lot of money in marijuana but is it gonna cost you a little more if you need some coke meth or god forbid heroin and so I think they'll ace it in there and people don't know so the only way you're gonna know is if you've smoked pot before so if you have never smoked pot and you buy some from this gentleman and you think oh okay that's kind of cool now you come and buy some for me cuz he's not around or someone says hey go get it from Lynn and I have something laced in it and you try it you're gonna only think oh this stuff is much better or oh my god I hate it and I'm going back to him so does that make sense so you only know if you've been exposed to the different drugs and so you know if you only like mine and I've got Coke in it pretty soon I say hey you know I don't have any marijuana but you want to try some coke because it makes you feel about the same and you're saying you know I want to feel the same and and here we go so I think that money has a lot to do with it and to get you moving up the ladder because drug dealers only care about one thing and that is money so does that kind of answer your question I mean forever we've had all drugs laced and all drugs certainly a lot of drugs get laced in heroin cocaine being a big one you know drugs can be laced with meth all of them ecstasy it gets a ton of drugs mixed in so I think it just moves them up that ladder give them a little more bang for the buck and then it costs more money yes I can hook you up with smart Colorado who is five women that have given up their entire life they have kids and they are down at the Capitol every day all day and have been for the last two plus years making sure that this is regulated properly and they have all kinds of insight that they can give you on what will work what doesn't work and I will connect you with them I'll give you information as soon as I'm done here I'm happy to do that but you know just getting some consistency I think would be really really good and you know being able to enforce it and I know you guys have a great Police Department here I have been in all the schools that these kids go to I was in Holy Family last week I was in Broomfield last week and I'll be in Legacy next month and so you know I asked the kids all the time is marijuana available they say yes and I always ask him and I'll ask you guys do you guys feel pressured to use marijuana our tea our kids today pressure feeling pressure to use marijuana just so available so you don't feel the pressure and a lot of kids say they feel very very pressured they have come down and testified at the Capitol saying they feel very pressured to use marijuana today by other kids so you know certainly I'll hook you up and we'll see what we can do but I know your SR Rose that the schools are awesome you know I know that matt has been trying to get the city to ban the vaporizers and the e-cigarettes and stuff like that so that he has a little more bite when they are on school property Danny can get them but right now with nothing they can - one thing you might want to look into is call some people up and brighten because I understand that brighten bandim in the city of brighton and so you might contact somebody up with the City Council yeah ban the vapes and the e-cigarettes and all that stuff so you might contact up there and ask them what they did and why but I know when I've talked to Matt in Broomfield he said if we could just get these vapes and the e cigarettes and everything banned he will have more you know a little more enforcement power on school property but right now there's nothing he can do about it so talk to the police department - but I'll hook you up smart sure you know the question is when you have all these different edibles and especially baked good and brownies sometimes you can get a little whiff of it and sometimes you can't so you can't always it rely on you know getting a marijuana odor it's not until you after actually ingest it and then you know 45 minutes to an hour in start feeling some effects so you know the ones I bought you know certainly you could now someone's making it at home you know I guess that you'd still get a little marijuana odor when you break it or eat it but you know if people are smoking pot at a party and you're having an edible do you necessarily think oh that odor might be coming from what I'm eating and so that becomes a part of the problem too is if it's already in the air you know you just think oh someone's smoking pot I'm just gonna eat my cookie and go from there so does that make sense so a lot of times you can can smell it especially when you break it and get it open other questions now you guys need to run screaming into the night Oh y'all gonna be ok you guys can call me anytime you can email me I'm happy to help out so thank you all for spending the evening here and I hope you found it all valuable so", "vXpeSL0-9V8": "[Music] [Music] you guys go just like my little stuffed animals

I have a few things I want to like to say about him now one of the great privileges about living in the basement are residing there they've gotta know Bruce in the last five six years and what a wonderful problem we have here so just background Bruce received his BS and homology at Louisiana State PhD in entomology musi Berkeley his titles are extensive distinguished professor of Entomology here joint appointment with the UC Davis cancer center director UC Davis Superfund program director NIH biotechnology training program director is the UC Davis faculty research awardee Electra warty distinguished teacher award for graduate and professional training and just last year he was so way overdue but in my ESA fellow so as probably I pulled this off his web is just incredible as laboratories produced will over 650 publications 30 patents 65 graduates over 300 postdoctoral visiting scientists and scholars and two companies have spawned from his lab there you know he was elected 1999 to the National Academy I thought this would be an opportunity just so a little bit about the the how sweet this group is you know this is one of the highest honors of course that any scientist can receive there's a membership of 2,100 members and 31 different sections and so his section was that he was elected to a 99 animal nutritional and applied micro microbial sciences so the citation reads you can look this up on the NIS website hammocks research to detect toxins and food the environment and human tissues using immunocytochemistry revolutionized environmental toxicology and set the present standard for approval of pesticides and products of biotechnology and by the way when this is judged on only 12 publications so that you probably have maybe 450 at that time but anyway you pick 12 of the best or that are representative and they don't care about the numbers they care about the quality so this is judged fairly on you know of the 12 really high-quality publications why do they accuse members so carefully first each member should serve as a role model for defining excellence in science for the next generation certainly Bruce fulfills that rule in a in a really important way and of course secondly the Academy supports this public service of the National Research Council this is operating arm n is and it provides policy so the heat from sets helped set national policy up here so anyway his title today I was his talk is maaz to medicine epoxide hydrolase inhibitors analgesic that is painkillers agents for neuropathic inflammatory pain please join me in welcoming blue salmon in any rate but I thought I do is to tell me what goes on down in the basement when we're not underwater and also to tell us a story of butterflies to blood pressure so if there's a real think in this talk yes that is very hard to see where science is going to go and it's gotten as a lot of different directions but this project started when I was a a beginning graduate student and only about this high and it involved a long way but I'm also going to give a little bit of background about some of the stuff going on in the lab so down in the basement we have three major projects there's an analytical group that i'm not going to talk about very much i'll i'll be talking about epoxy hydrolases and mammals so this is where most of the people in the basement are now are now working but I'm of course an arthropod biologist at heart and this work started with insect developmental biology a long time ago so i really like hell caterpillars turn into butterflies for metamorphosis and insects and of course the the really magical thing that I've been wondering about my whole life is how do we go from this eating machine to a reproduction distribution machine and this process is under the control of a number of hormones but juvenile hormone is one of the major ones and many years ago with snore GTO we were he has the metabolism of juvenile hormone which is degraded by the pox I hydrolase to a dial heaven estrace to a nelson both of these are biologically active now now chrome does a couple of things branched out I'm going to talk very briefly about some insect control applications and one but the major thing that came up from this is it Illustrated that a very potent chemical mediator in this case jugal hormone could be regulated as much by degradation as by biosynthesis of course we have to ask in the same thing Curren malice the other day is fighting this really interesting enzyme that takes an epoxy it's remembered cyclic either to a 12 diamond and does that occur and if you are just an incense and the answer is Gus incursion us so with juvenile hormone if we inhibit the degradation of juvenile hormone we get these massive larkin least you know 20 ground hot dogs they can eat a whole tomato plant upon one setting now this didn't really impress the neem very much and so he suggested that I stop screwing around the pesticide and do something safe so a number of years ago in collaboration with a civil mayita sean duffy and a number of people in the lab including aura hiding and the pack we took one of the degrading enzymes from insects put it in a as a common cold or lateral virus when the insect is infected with this virus it turns into the full of black guy it stops eating and it tries to puking so we were able to generate the first genetically engineered Bartlett's exercise actually though it turned out something else besides the inside work better and that these are Venom's for one of Boris pets of a scorpion so there were very very potent scorpions aust workin Venom's that worked on mammals as a person we have a collaborative project with high powering on some of these and mammals but George found that George can be found that some often were very selective for insects so these are data from George comedians I remember and these are heliothis lobby both have been thought about the virus both insects will dollars but this one where the wild type virus will continue to grow and eat and this one is contracting because the virus is tricking the insect into making a poison essentially a biochemical pyrethroids insecticide and what this does is it doesn't increase the amount of kill but it increases the speed of kill so the recombinant virus kills the insects very quickly before they can do crop damage and you can see this in cotton leaves where the wild type virus ultimately tells the larvae but after it's done a lot of damage we can also see it on cotton clamps for the damage here is dramatically reduced compared to the wild type however we ran into problems are more economic than anything else in the u.s. these viruses are used in China but they're not used in the US so we're back to juvenile hormone degradation a pox I hydrolase and asking does the enzyme occur in the answer is yes so you have several pots I'd hydrolases that converts cyclicamp oxide into 12 diets it also converts some compounds that are very mutagenic and carcinogenic I'm sure nobody in here eats eats peanut butter or pistachio ice cream all but if you did you would form highly toxic \u00e9poque sides and you don't get captured because you can personalize so this gives I'm all occurs in many tissues and there are two major forms and us one form of microsomal hydrolase brightens out the epoxy and peanut butter and diesel exhaust the other epoxy hydrolase we found the Sergey guilt and this talk is going to be a translational talk the National Institutes of Health wants us to translate everything we do into something that helps people well this is the translational talk the work started in 1969 and we're translating it to the clinic well it only took Christmas to thanksgiving to do it but it was Christmas 69 versus getting it into place and Thanksgiving of 2007 so translation fundamental complied is it so fast now these these little less up here are color-coded can't read them I can't eat agreed but the key is the work started with practical science way back here making juvenile hormone mimics some of which are still the Davis lumber and I maybe the compound that we use for these studies just before christmas in 1969 but then we have you know 30 years of fundamental curiosity-driven research before we start getting back to biomedical research or applied research and if there's a bottom line to dust it's that it's fairly easy to tell the difference between dumb science design or design site exciting probably the most fundamental site are the most applied science we do is on the Middleburg then we're going to find the transistor not by improving the faculty but by just trying things because we're interested and this is a case where we've gone from a very fundamental question what makes caterpillars turn into butterflies to materials that are actually in the clinic so these are parkside hydrolases are high levels and mammals including you they occur at high levels in the liver which would suggest barn compounds powers but if we move outside the liquor here at very high levels for instance in your basket or smooth muscle they're very high levels in the astrocytes in your brain they're very high levels in descending blue to handle your kitten that suggests intermediary and regulatory metabolism it doesn't suggest foreign compound metabolism and so even in the 70s RG Gil and I developed the hypothesis that these compounds were involved in regulating and dodging chemical mediators and mammals just like they are in a sense so the enzyme oh this is an x-ray picture of the enzyme of biochemists get really excited over this hob because we like pictures of what we do and they're very pretty but the enzyme is a homo diode that means two parts this is one monomer this is the other and it comes with a green part and a blue Kart and when we first clone the enzyme years ago Jeff Beetham who was allowed here said that if Darwin hadn't invented evolution we would have to admit because the the evolution of the enzyme turns out to be just incredibly everything but the epoxide hydrolase atmosphere it's an alpha-beta folders I'm like cholinesterase in us or like the enzymes in your laundry detergent it clean your clothes the alpha-beta fold enzymes are very broad family of enzymes all of which have the same structure they do a whole bunch of different tanks and in this case it doesn't pots I inauguration so this is this is the picture that is only semi science fiction and that is that this is an x-ray crystal structure you're inside the Untied looking out towards water here here and the enzyme was crystallized with an inhibitor and we modeled out the inhibitor and model beyond what we think is a natural substrate so the catalytic site is is long greasy tube that goes deep within the inflamed the catalytic site has a couple of tyrosines that polarize the epoxy a nucleophilic aspartic acid that attacks it most people think acids or are not nucleophiles but in a lipophilic environment they are and the enzyme works to open the epoxy and we think the endogenous substrate is an epoxy no effect so we also often don't think of fats as chemical mediators but in fact pregnancy blood pressure pain are all controlled by biologically active fact in us so if we look at how the enzyme works we can figure out the transition state inhibitor to inhibited I'm not really going to go into it but but our inhibitors which I'll be talking about fit very tightly within the enzymes term like oj simpson's hand inside it flops for sure and something it's really fun is in the year that I was born uncle linus pauling came up with an idea that absolutely revolutionized biochemistry called transition state theory he didn't think much of it he published in a couple of junk turtles that are actually are have zero impact zone all but the concept was that every catalyst is working by stabilizing transition States and he actually did it with just Mickey Mouse algebra and he said that every reaction has a transition state it keeps it from going spontaneously every catalyst stabilizes the transition state the only way to stabilize the transition is to bind to it and then he calculated how tightly and boxy it's really tight but instead of talking about this from the standpoint of else broke I'm going to use one of my favorite places this is south of mammoth on the east side of zero and i'll be talking about right there this is where the easter ret of Mount Humphreys joins the north of Mount humphreys so if we go there and we follow this rope this rope goes up to number 17 so my son is climbing it's a mellow old egg the rock is warns rocks hard nothing's loose he's not hanging on very tight but he's going to climb another 75 feet and he's going to get right here that's an overhang so he's going to have to climb out under this overhang and as he does this he can look 7000 vertical feet down to Bishop California now that's an unstable transition state in a half when tom is in this transition state he's hanging on for dear life because he knows that I'm on the other end of the rope and I'm not a very good belayer so good climbers aren unstable transitions really weird things happen to them similarly substrate some progress and unstable transitions can be modified you can do magic in the unstable transition so by mimicking the transition state of the enzyme you can sit at your desk and you can intellectually design a horrible inhibitor of an enzyme and our most potent drugs and pesticides are transition state and abuse so could we made these we made some that were real terrible but we finally came up with some that had a little bit of friendliness as far as biologists and since this is Davis you know we're not doing complex chemistry the business end of the molecule is here we go you can get that by stimulating your production with their you can then add a little Crisco at this end this is for Angela since she's really into fat and because we might teach somebody important like our X governator we put this world's smallest diamond out here so this is a compound that if you're a chemist you look at this and you see it's a nightmare compound it has the physical properties of alcohol but it was good enough that we were able to then do a chemical knockout and ask what is the bile issue this enzyme inside of a mouse so we have found a drug and all we needed was a disease to fit the drug and so that's going to be the rest of the talk it turns out that a fat called arachidonic acid is a key chemical mediator us on this pathway your rocket down at Cascade accounts for seventy-five percent of the medications used in the world this pathway prostaglandins that's aspirin advil motrin all controls childbirth it controls what pressure controls pain if you feel terrible with the flu it's because high levels of prostaglandins are busily killing the bacteria but also killing you a little bit as well there's another pathway to the loop of trains you can think of this pathway as asthma this is why you don't give aspirin to amazing but there are two other pathways that are poorly studied but they come for about a third of the Cascade whatever goes to a box on so we're back two o'clock sides these compounds are called ETS or eats another we'll stick a hydroxy group on the end of the molecule so these cytochrome p450s are operating in you right now and they're operating in a balanced switching back and forth between these two pathways 28 \u00e9t\u00e9 is one of the most hypertensive and inflammatory compounds known it's making your blood pressure your luck it's making information go on X make hypertension blood pressure and pain go down now because these biologies are useful we have a balance but it turns out if you get this pathway for dominance if your allowance myth this pathway predominates unfortunately for me if you do nothing but get old this pathway predominance so we'd like to turn up this one but we don't know how but we do know how to do is to kill this enzyme if we show the enzyme it degrades these then we have an increasing increase of eats and a decrease in blood pressure information and paint in most cases that's a that's a good thing so I the first indication we really found was for all cardiovascular disease I'm going to go through this very quickly and then move on to things that are new and more exciting and unpublished but if we take a cross-section of your blood vessel you have a faster in the theater this is the lining of your blood vessel and we have the vascular smooth muscle controlling the diameter of the blood vessel if your blood vessel contracts blood flow is restricted blood pressure goes up there is a Nobel Prize for mo right here on how the vascular endothelium tells the vascular smooth muscle to relax or constraint and this is a no laughing gas but when they got the Nobel Prize they said there's another factor it turns out that that other factor called the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor Martha eats the epoxy I Cosimo's they're produced by the vascular endothelium telling the vascular smooth muscle relax and reduce blood pressure so I'll Christoph more so and I ran this over Annie verson Hall originally body was repeated in Germany bye bye Ruby boosie screw in a very elegant experiment so we're looking at blood pressure as a function of time and mice right here we put in a little pump that dispenses angiotensin which which our zoo is now doing to the love this changes the poor little mouse into a 50 year old plus man and blood pressure skyrockets so this is most male hypertension is angiotensin Trevor if we give an eh inhibitor blood pressure doesn't go out this lunch here what's done is really complex experiment the water bottles are shifting when these animals are taken off of the drug blood pressure skyrockets with these animals put on the drug blood pressure drops other thing that's really unique about these compounds is that there are wholly static so no matter how about you the drug we give to control animal we don't change the blood pressure so we can reduce high blood pressure but we don't drop normal blood pressure so the compounds move us back to Holman stations seh is are also a potential target for treating information we've used one indication called sepsis this is a very heart and treat most of us in this room will die of sepsis but we are mainly using it not so much from a treatment standpoint as a model of inflammation we're also using a technique called macabre lumix where we basically take a mouse or a baby and shove it into a mass bag this is what goes on in either sinhala it pulls apart and asked what's there so we're using mass spectrometry asked what are the eicosanoids in the blood of a mouse or mat so this is a small part of the arachidonic cascade here's a rafa donna cassidy and it basically says arachidonic acid can go to many many metabolites and each of these are biologically important and what we're able to live in mass spectrometry does not just look at a single compound like prostaglandin but look at a pattern and begin to see what is the biology that's being driven and how is it a trip so there's a lot of analytical chemistry involved in this so if the substance experiment is we give mice live a polysaccharide that's the outside of bacteria regardless of how we give it all of my stuff if we give an eh inhibitor nonetheless time so this is all witnesses say an experiment even a monstrumologist integer so Mike's have to feed facing down their life and like this they're not alive and so we have this binary system for telling how the mice are they take a guy of of acute hypotension low blood pressure the drugs will increase blood pressure back to normal so that's the biology if we look now at the acoustic profile these are the arachidonic metabolites are looking at by mass spec we find in yellow if the animals were given LPS the epoxides go down we expect them if we give the H inhibitor shown in blue they go up we expect that the dials do just the opposite of the products the product dials you are if we give the inhibitors include aisles go down we expect that now you notice these are our linear perhaps with metal but this this is a log raft here we're monitoring prostaglandin e2 this is the major prostaglandin that is the driver when you get to foot it's pain its fever its information if we have LPS prostaglandin goes up a thousandfold you feel really terrible with food if we divvy Asian hitters it's reduced prostaglandins are on this side of the rocket on in cascade the apartheid hydrolase inhibitors are working on this side said working it turns out that easing pops eicosanoids transcriptionally down-regulate cops to this is where vioxx celebrates our work to reduce this inflammatory enzyme and a number of other inflammatory enzymes and cytokines so the East are reducing inflammation at the transcriptional level the level of messenger RNA so if we have LPS prostaglandins go up if we give some rest that go down we have low dose of celebrex they don't go down will give an seh inhibitors and go down we combine investigation tivat earth with celebrex props in or out film we get a synergistic interaction so these compounds are very anti inflammatory a lot of the diseases we face as humans are inflammatory disease this is work by nipsy oh no that in the medical school where she's looking at cardiac hypertrophy big hearts in a number of different models she can create this massive hypertrophy if we do it outside hydrolase inhibitors we can reduce heart sighs back to normal and can do it he took prophylactically or therapeutically right now there is no therapy for cardiac hypertrophy so this is a very exciting result these are data from our zoo these are our mice fed McDonald's hamburgers this is a ortak arch you get a huge buildup of lipid if we give the eh inhibitor they order garbage is more or less clear of lipid so vascular information is a major driver particularly the most prevalent state of information so the EH inhibitors that we haven't allowed are more potent than the common nonsteroidal inflammatories and aspirin and the concepts like dioxin celebrex I'm not getting into this but yawn yawn and others in the lab and also shown that the EH inhibitors will reduce the toxicity of these commonly used drugs so these drugs all increase drama Chris and GI problems so i'm going to go very briefly into drug development so all a major problem that we face is most innovation is occurring in universities it's really hard to develop a drug in university industry seems to be crippled in developing new drugs but they have the resources to develop so how do we get from the ideas in the university to new translation industry and there's a real problem because industry wants you to be quite far along this path but NSF NIH only fund early state research so what we've been doing under the table in the lab is trying to convert this idea into a practical drug now there are a lot of sophisticated ways to do chemistry but we do call Goldilocks chemistry our Goldilocks and distal chemistry so basically we make a compound if we find that it's too big we make a little bit if we find it's too little we make a middle-sized or if it's too hot we make a cool them or two cool we make a warm-up and this way several of us and allowed including saying and Thuggee wander through chemical space trying to make better and better confidence we look at the potency of the compound but we also look at the pharmacokinetics so here the compounds were given two dogs by finding died and our early compounds didn't get in very well and when they did they were very quickly metabolize so this is looking at blood levels other compounds were able to get in but were quickly metabolize but now increasingly we have compounds and a very potent on recombinant human enzyme but when we feed them to dogs or mice or rats or monkeys they get in and give reasonable blood levels so what we've done is to not try to play like a little fighting but to in fact use what I call the medchem sort of have analogous to the Harry Potters flirting happen so what we can say is in academics we're good at some things we're good at being cheap and we're going to be fast and so we do that work in drug development it is fast and cheap we can screen code to see with a robot very very quickly we can look at physical properties and computer modeling because that's not very expensive that's it i'm inside a computer we can do inexpensive talk like the ames essay and we've worked out ways to do pharmacokinetics which is the great limiting step and drug development and by doing this we've come up with compounds that are pretty good so looking through the years what we've done is made compounds that have better exposure and better efficacy so we monitor efficacy using the clone human enzyme and saying help voters compound that's the denominator and then in this case Cindy fed these compounds to monkeys and looked at blood levels that's area under the blood curve or exposure by looking at this ratio through time we've come up with better invest comp balance that look more and more drug life and this is what we're trying to actually take into the clinic news a pharmaceutical company got the compounds throughout of the patents from UC and took actually a compound published by our lab into the clinic unfortunately it was neither potent or very good so as a summary then what we're trying to do is we know that our automatic acid is a major chemical mediator it can go to prostaglandins it can go to a cheeky ease but it also can go to these o'clock signs stabilizing these of oxide by giving the epoxy iPod your lights we reduce a hypertension and so what I'm getting into them is worth it Karen and more have done in the basement that is new work and that is that if these compounds work on information like maximum we would expect them to be a little bit analgesic but if we give a number of different compounds at a number of different doses to rats we don't change at all their ability to perceive pain well that's kind of a good thing right you don't want pain to completely go away on the other hand if an animal has an enhanced a state so in this case hate is in this direction in all the slides and asic situated Payton stages in red and normal pain perception is in green so if you think about getting the flu you'll notice that if your shirt sleeve rubs on your arm or your pants rub on your leg did that really hurt that's called allodynia or if you stub your toe that's a minor pain but it's just unbearable if you have a flu that's hyperalgesia so what we're doing is in rats is monitoring enhanced and compete or allodynia or hyperalgesia and then asking with increased doses of eh inhibitors and we return this package moment and the answer is yes using a number of different inflammatory agents we can return it back to normal but not only do we do it in normal pain if we induce page with prostaglandin e2 this is that prostaglandin that is produced when you get sick you get a tremendous enhancement in pain but if you take an aspirin if you take a celebrate if you take an advil it doesn't do any good even if you take asteroid like that too that doesn't dexamethasone you can't reverse this pain but the eh inhibitors can reduce prostaglandin induced pain which is a very good thing so the EH inhibitors are far more potent than morphine morphine can reduce pain let's open these seh inhibitors and the numbers look about to say except that one is 10 meta grams and one is 10 micrograms so these are very very powerful compounds the compounds like working have another problem and that is they block gullibility and the calcination the EH inhibitors seem to not reduce coordination and not reduce alertness and animals although whether they're addictive remains to be seen no oh my main job in the basement is hustling money but occasionally I come up with a brilliant idea so I suggested tomorrow a number of years ago that having tried a number of pain models he tried neuropathic pain because nothing works under a path of pain and I expected us to fail and thus I'll be able to say while our compounds work on this pain but not this paid their forward from you could be but we're fairly not prepped the surprise is the compounds work really well on a tractable neuropathic pain so you can get neuropathic pain in many ways or if you get in a car accident and you have a damaged nerve you can get neuropathic pain the one that they'll probably have two people in this room at some kind of face is that in diabetes severe neuropathic pain is a major comorbidity so a lot of the work that Orin Kerr have done is with a type one nineties model so as type 1 diabetes progresses the high levels of sugar cause nerve die back and neuropathic pain so if we look at the allodynia from type 1 diabetes in these pain so this would be a normal animal a diabetic animal we can reverse that pain in a dose-dependent action with the h if we compare this to the major industry standard used for neuropathic pain gabapentin the EH inhibitors are about 10 times more potent in this figure not only that the gabapentin needs to be given every 24 hours put some fairly severe side effects and with time the efficacy of the gabapentin will drop eh inhibitor used in the study it reverses paying with a single dose of about 72 hours the other thing that I find really interesting is the most common drug prescribed for neuropathic pain are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and Cox's and they don't work they never they often in fact will make pain works so diclofenac is the major nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory used in the world it actually will make the diabetic pain worse but if we combine seh inhibitor and a low dose with diclofenac we get a synergistic reduction in neuropathic pain so we're really excited about this because this is an unmet medical needs where it looks like that either used alone or used in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and concepts but these might be able to treat a previously unattainable so in this model if we look at the eh inhibitor this is a structure zosyn diabetes one model we can reduce pain so we get a little bit of hyperalgesia that's reducing pain beyond the point for it's not there morphine and also do the same thing in this model but with morphine we get sedation and a loss of coordination and this is the problem faced by people with neuropathic pain the drugs at work have such devastating side effects that it's a it's a real trade-off so do these compounds offer risk to you well I don't know hopefully we'll find out but you're okay that if you all used I also and wish everybody else did is the commercial cells you may have 80 nanograms per mil of this quite potent agent computer in your blood if you don't use dial soap you probably still have about 5 nanograms per mil because the compound goes right through sewage treatment and these personal care products are pretty pervasive in the environment but at any rate these compounds will in fact reduce pain and our powerful th inhibitors so the story that I've told you probably has a little bit of truth to it it started a long time ago when I was very very small and very very job in graduate school where he was Archie Gilliam we were working on and a chemical mediator in insects and asking how this chemical mediator regulates Marvel pupil transformation in doing this we found that not only the production of the compound is important but also its degradation by pot side hydrolases and hysteresis so this work leaded a whole bunch of direction one is the juvenile and last week we celebrated life hedrick years ago finding JH mimics that in fact are still the mainstay and mosquito control in california based on a smaller firm but there are molecules and us that also have oxide and esters by looking at this end of the molecule that insects we've had a pretty good time with genetically engineered our own pesticides in mammals this is where they lipase ela to an enzyme called power with us sell marijuana firms at this end of the moment one so in the joopa hormone has been a really interesting molecule at this end but at this end is led to setting up oxide hydrolases so clocks I Hydra lasers are not only important in insect chemical ecology metabolizing paramos metabolising the dodgems plant compounds but also in regulating potent chemical mediators you love hormone and insects and this very potent chemical mediator hypoxia cosas tried noak acids and us so if there is a grand overview of what we've been trying to do it's to avoid medicine as usual so medicine is usual just playing a piano like I played piano I do the one finger piano play so you go to a doctor and you say I've got a headache the doctor pushes one key it says aspirin go away take two you go to the doctor you say well my knee hurts the doctor uses the other finger pushes on the piano key says celebrex go away take two a day don't bother me but potentially what we can do is by understanding the car bombings and individualizing medicine we could say well if you take a very low dose of celebrex and very low dose of sth you'll get a synergistic interaction and your meat will feel a lot better without all the side effects but maybe Angela we can even be better and that is that we could dial in nutraceuticals maybe if we are increasing our omega-3 lipids whose epoque sides Boris found or even more active than arachidonic that we could alter our diet potentially use pharmaceuticals if we need after our lifestyle because if you go jogging it turns out to eat in your blood go way up and alter our diet to begin to play the piano with one hand instead of one finger or maybe even use macatawa mix so that we can individualize diagnosis and treatment and begin to really begin to deliver all individualized and integrative medicine of course this is you know the next five generations and I'm bringing it up hoping that some of you will address problems like this and having a coastal assembly where we begin understand how the echoes knowledge really worked and the complexity of how the eicosanoids and the cytokines talked with each other to control or violation so I wanted to show pictures of subletting panel of sing and some he have done the chemistry work recently Karen and bordering the pain work but the project is of course much beyond this with collaborators around the world and a whole bunch of really wonderful exciting colleagues in the basement to continue to try to teach me biology and chemistry and if this is Cathy's favorite picture of our wonderful good fight all I wanted in with two things one is that I teach kayaking throughout your adventures so I'm always looking for victims and water this year is really high and it's really cold and really exciting and since a lot of you here are grad students science is serious that's the number one priority but you are at a university so take the time to go to classes and literature maybe classes in history and maybe pottery but also may be out and that's my favorite Mountain bear creek's fire and this is a lab bear creek's fire from several years ago and I all end there and see if you guys have left usually the inner pain scattering or any of these drugs the issue of toxicity the initial addiction is an important one how we lived it do we have a look at it addiction yoma we have you the people in the field will often separate dependence from identity so if you have a pinched nerve you may be very very dependent on the drug that you would do almost anything for it you probably wouldn't know your mother and that's basically the difference between addiction and tennis since we don't see clearville information we don't see sedation and we don't see a lot of coordination we think that the effects will probably not lead to addiction but you never know until we get into humans and in fact we may find that we simply have mouse rat and dog drugs and we don't have human drugs as far as toxicity the company that took one compound into the clinic failed to find any toxicity on the toxicity screens that we've done I've never seen a profile as clean as these as a toxicologist but there is always a caution in science and that's dead you know weekly we test hypotheses we never prove anything we cannot prove a compound safe we can only show that it's not safe so with the letter line you know an incredible disaster in Europe in reality you cannot look for birth defects until you knew to look for birth defects so until the compound has gone through all the pre ind work we don't know what we have done is we've applied to the nih great program for trying to get what's called an IND this is investigational new drug status so the compound can be used in man and we're trying to do this in the public sector so that physicians in Toronto or New York could use it in quantity class Jeff how do you test for technical question and then another one but how do you test for pain in inroads so there are a number of different ways but the basis of what we do is a ladainian hyperalgesia so I'm really worried about housing pain enamels you know it really is terrible to be a captive Rotem and have pain inflicted but we're looking at allodynia and hyperalgesia so this is the enhanced paint state that you would get for instance if you had had the flu so we use for mechanical stimulation we use something called the bond frog fiber which is the same thing a doctor we could use the red is standing on a mesh and his foot is basically tickled with a computer-controlled fiber of different strings and when the rats is a duck tickles unless its foot that's one indication the other is we put the rat on the glass plate and by the way the fibers same thing you would do it yourself but that's not the pain that's just not pain but it's an indication of pain so this hyperalgesia model has been associated with pain ultimately we don't know and tell us a map with the other is we put them on a plate or a laser shines on their foot and then a computer says well when do they lift their foot and so when you put your hand on this plate you begin to feel it very slightly warm and so that's our other our other model but then we're inducing the allodynia and hyperalgesia in a number of different different ways but you're bringing up a really important point and that is that pain has a social context and emotional context physiological context and so it's very very difficult to extrapolate from rhodos demand do do mice diet or is hypertension a risk factor in mice you can generate hypertension to the point for the mouse so have you tried your compounds do they live longer if you have some some that have hypertension others don't and is there is your assay just for short-term or does it lifetime our essays or short-term so by short-term say with what our zoo is doing we're limited by the length of a mini pump it releases interest while you can release angiotensin forever to do that so we're looking at a period of weeks we have another model where we place the human renin enzyme under the blue gene promoter so if we feed the rats blue jeans and this will induce a human renin and the Brennan will make a attention so this can be a very long term but the longest term studies that we've done on hypertension have been six months butterflies they really have information so all years ago in physiology book i read the insects didn't now this is just about a creature without having kids the pykrete and really what that book is the insects seem to have an immune system it's very different from us and I probably would have been correct in 1950 but now we know that it although insects don't have my GG they have a cellular immune system that is partly senator powers they have laboratory system and they are specialized they have they're doing the same things we are very into place but there's some things they do that are just absolutely the same protein kinases and now they have and you know sort of team I kind I'm sure you have I know I am in the villages all is very part for ourselves that the bubble table Fermi sea and air museum will have avoided these thoughts which one the oxide involved something that we have not napped in insects they're over at locations where we've seen your bond on a decade involve innocence of pressure all so it doesn't appear to be nearly as important with us we're going to buy something like versus candy the codes they have exactly the same as imported these and the oxide lipolysis but when I put Australia is that was dumping arachidonic Trivedi's on grovyle's it turns out they views and shorter chasity to do about with our money my dad is going to be we're going to see both analogy apology so I think we better hold up okay today here so thanks very much Bruce", "_Jt0c4cMN8o": "hey I got something I want to share with you I'm using a chicken leg if you're tired of just regular standard-issue chicken legs on the grill give this a try what I'm doing is making a chicken lollipops and I've got a few of them already knocked out here you can see I'll set them out here where you can kind of see where we're going now doesn't that look like a much better presentation than a boring old chicken leg and it's real simple what we're doing the most difficult part of this process is just getting these tendons out that's along the bones but what I do to turn them into this lollipop and you just take a knife go ride around the knuckle into the leg free up the skin cut loose those tendons that are in there all the way down to the bone when you set bonding start working it down then what you want to do is just kind of work work the end of that meat up and over the knuckles and grab your rag just because it helps you grip it a little better just take it right off you're going to trash that piece now you get it freed up and what I like to do is just take the rag hold the chicken down you come pull all the meat down to one end so I can try to pull that bone out of it you gotta watch it here because there's another little bone in here runs right along run along the main bone and I'll just take that and kind of work my fingers down in there until I can get it loose and they'll snap right out now just push the meat down take some scissors get rid of all these loose little tendons down the end but just doing this because hey you can't eat those tendons and be it helps on the presentation and that's it right there chicken lollipops now that I have the chicken legs trimmed into the lollipops I'm going to season them I've got some general AP seasoning an all-purpose that I'm going to give them a first a good coat each leg now I'm going to come back and hit them with the barbecue rub lay on that second flavor I'm looking for us will swim really make them pop make them good and for the cooking process I'm going to fire me yoder to 300 now I've got this pan you'll see sitting over here beside me with a stick of butter in it I don't want the butter to come up over the chicken legs but I want it to provide some extra flavor and moisture in the bottom of the pan so I'll set that pan on my grill when it comes up to temp let it be melting then I'll take the legs out there put them on now I've got one final step that I'm going to do these for the prep and this is strictly for appearance but if you skip it your bones you're going to end up really really dark and there's a sign of look good especially if you're doing this for a contest you want to take the time to do this and all I do is take a little strip of full and I'm just going to cover up the ends of these bones just to protect them and if they're easy to unwrap what they're done and it will unwrap them right before we glaze and that way the bone it won't be black it'll have a really good look to it it's just for protection and appearance so you're not worried about how it looks how you skip it but doesn't take with a second so so I'm gonna get these wrapped up and go get the grill fired up I'll show you how I'm going to cook on the squeeze it's up to ten okay I got my cooker fired up I'm setting it 300 degrees and I'm just going to get I've had the butter on here melted pan we talked about earlier now I'm just going to take these chicken lollipops and just stand them up and it's going to talk about two hours to get where I want them we're looking for 175 in the leg what we want to glaze them as well so if we catch them about 165 we're going to bring them in dip them in sauce take the aluminum fall off the top glaze it a little bit for looks and then finish them up but you just want to stand them here keep a constant tempo on your cooker get the lid closed and let it do its thing so we're going to give it two hours we'll come back check on them okay it's been two hours out here smoking on the yoader I've had just some apple pellets on here it's all I'm using today and chicken is looking really good as you can see now I'm going to transfer it to a chicken rack and take it inside and glaze it and bring it out and just set the rack right on the cooker that's looking really good let's take a bit cyclones and we'll get them back on for about 30 minutes and they're done okay we're going to pull off the lollipops here I'm just going to show you the last when they come out pretty clean when you take the fall off but I just discard it now I have some bud some killer Hawks sauces our sauce I just warmed it up slightly slightly in a small pot and all I do is take them and just give them a good dump you want to cover it really good there's no need to put the extra seasoning on them at this point those we went we've already got double layer now go ahead and give the ball and dump too just to give it some shine we're going to put these back on just for about 30 minutes I temp these just so I know where they were at right we're on 170 degrees internal so then you want the sauce a little warm but not so hot you can't stick your fingers and of course I just have on these nitrile gloves but but you'll see that using that full really kept that bone from getting too dark and if you're going to use these as attorney in you want to look like this okay I've got them all glazed here all the chicken lollipops and now I'm ready just to take this pan and all I'm going to do is just lift the rack straight out of the pan set it right on the grade on the yoader we're still at 300 degrees and they just need about 30 minutes just long enough to caramelize the sauce I'm not trying to get any more degrees heat out of them I just want to set the sauce really so all right back here at the yoader going straight I'll pick them all up at one time that's what's handy about this little rack keeping them on these rags just Center them back up let them glaze for about 20-30 minutes is all they're gonna need you just you don't want to start burning you want to catch it to where that sauce just sets just perfectly all right it's been about 30 minutes of glaze and we're going to check them out and that's exactly what I want to see they look the salsa set but it's not turning dark if you keep it on the heat any longer it's going to start burning on you so anytime your glazing something like this stress freezing the sweet sauce ours is a sweet sauce you want to watch the heat on it and don't let it stay on too long let it take a close look assume let's chicken lollipops on the yoader all right here we are this is the finished lollipop chicken and I'm telling you man it looks it smells and I know it's going to taste as good as it looks oh this is the one is that that's unique that you can do with chicken drum drumsticks and if you're tired of boring your chicken legs but uh of course you know I gotta give it a try so let me pick one of these and I'll take this outside just so you know that's good stuff moisture skin bit right through give this lollipop chicken a try as always if you like what I'm doing subscribe to my newsletter excuse the sauce check us out on Facebook send us comments

address a very diverse aleikum not really", "jPHrBx-paMc": "okay sounds like Mike's working hope you don't mind I tend to like to walk around a little bit hence the hence to lapel mic and I'd like to thank David in the college for asking me to to talk today a lot of my colleagues sort of think that was a bit crazy doing a PhD in sync I think is sort of quite a challenging area in an area from from which a lot of cardiologists kind of run and would prefer to be in the lab doing more procedural work so I've got a sort of I guess a series of cases and things that I thought I'd run run through as a way of talking about issues in this space I am as David said an adult cardiologist so this is focused on adults and adults think a bit so first thing to sort of ask yourself I guess is what the definition of a syncope is and syncope is a transient loss of consciousness so it falls under that general umbrella it's rapidly reversible and usually minimal sort of intervention is required to do it and it's typically due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow and that's primarily driven by a fall in blood pressure the definition is important because it's not uncommon that people fail to discriminate different causes of transient loss of consciousness and tend to sometimes overlay syncope seizures collapses and various forms of altered consciousness and tend to merge it into one so think if he does have a fairly strict definition so looking at epidemiology vasovagal syncope still dominates as the number one cause of syncope across all age groups so you can see that it follows essentially a bimodal age distribution so more common in teenagers early 20s that it's certainly a group that I see and then from the fifth and sixth onwards again escalating in incidence and with our aging population we're going to see more and more patients presenting at that latter end of the spectrum so there's a range of diagnoses that one might think about in the younger patient we get worried about whether we're missing more sinister pathology like one QT syndrome or regarder or something that might cause sudden cardiac death and in all the patients it then becomes an issue again of are we missing or going out and looking for significant cardiac pathology whether it's a rythme Azure ischemia pulmonary embolism whatever it might be depending on the clinical clinical scenario I always play this video pretty much all my think if you thought [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so that footballer is obviously has died unfortunately on the on the soccer field and typically we all sort of see in the media reports of people dying during sporting events at a young age and whenever you see a patient with syncope the first thing that comes to mind is risk stratification for sudden death this is a algorithm there are many of these algorithms looking at syncope but the crux of of any algorithm is risk stratification so the beginning there's clinical history which I can't emphasize enough is a critical component of your assessment physical examination obviously and the 12-lead ECG along with blood pressures forms the cornerstone of assessment and you can get the vast bulk of the data that you need to work out a potential cause in your patients by spending an adequate amount of time doing that and then it comes to this key sort of dichotomy of working out whether your patient with syncope is somebody at low risk of cardiac syncope and potentially sudden death or whether your patient is a high-risk patient and rather than creating grey zones and so on I think it is better to follow this sort of algorithm and think in a fairly dichotomous dichotomous way so risk stratification of syncope involves assessing a patient's history in great detail working out whether they what the situation in which the syncope occurred did it cooker with exercise is there a good trigger for it what their background history is do they have a history of sudden cardiac death that sort of thing and then obviously looking at findings on ECG now I've sort of listed a whole series of IV CG findings it and in essence what I've kind of done is lifted just about every common ECG abnormality that I could think of and fit on the slide and be vaguely legible and the idea there is to basically tell you that any abnormal ECG should be a red flag in a syncope patient raising the possibility that you could be dealing with a cardiac cardiac issue so in essence to stratify a patient into one of these low-risk categories you need a history and physical physical examination but a history that is consistent with those Oh vagal syncope so a typical story and we'll talk about what that typical story might might be a little bit later on in the talk you want to see a plumb normal ECG and in that sort of setting you would define the patient as low-risk anything potentially outside of that you would probably classify as high-risk so we'll start with a couple of cases then so this is a young chap and I keep refer IT professional flavor of the talk they're always playing sport I don't know why I've done that but anyway playing sport has a syncopal event on this on the football fields not particularly keen in getting assessment which is not uncommon of course no significant past history there's no history in the family of sudden cardiac death and that's that's quite important but on examination of course you've heard a harsh systolic murmur does anybody want to shout out what they're thinking yeah so abnormal abnormal ECG thoughts on the ECG can just shout out I don't mind yeah what else oh sorry so in saying hypertrophic or obstructive cardiomyopathy and then we're saying large complexes I can quite hear that either Q waves what about there P waves yeah so the big sort of jump out abnormality is the is the big sort of t-wave inversion could be left ventricular hypertrophy in an older person you might be thinking about ischemia but of course in this setting in a young person with a harsh systolic murmur we're thinking about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so the echocardiogram on the right shows a normal on the left of your screen obviously shows a normal left ventricle and if I can fix lillies of there we go so so this is the this is the left ventricle here this is the mitral valve the aortic valve the aorta coming out through there and the top here is your right atrium we call this the right ventricle rather so this is what we call the parasternal long axis view and as you come into this one you can see that the septum is markedly thickened which is typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at least of this particular pattern and if you look very closely at the movement of the anterior mitral leaflet you kind of get the sense that it's kind of there's motion of the of the leaflet into the outflow tract with systole and that's what you sometimes see on reports when a cardiologist reports back and says systolic anterior motion and it's part of the obstructive process that causes the high gradient and the murmur in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy we get worried about sudden death in this setting particularly in patients with syncope and that's a at the bottom was a representative sort of whole tour ECG tracing that basically showed ventricular tachycardia so this stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is challenging particularly in people that don't have a history of sudden cardiac death but any patient who's got akhom and an episode of syncope would be regarded as as at elevated risk other factors that play in would be the thickness of the septums a massive septal hypertrophy for example anybody with a family history of sudden death in would be at higher risk lots of ventricular ectopy or runs of VT on a holter monitor and falls in blood pressure with exercise is also is also important but it's complex but the upshot is from a sort of take-home message point of view is this question of is this patient at risk of sudden cardiac death do they need a defibrillator this sort of patient clearly needs expert assessment and a determination of that to try to mitigate risk so the question yeah that is also a take-home message yeah and yeah and that's and that's a message you'll see in a few of the other slides as well that exercise induced syncope is extremely abnormal when it occurs during exercise not when it occurs post exercise so second case so this is another I guess it's another exercise sort of thing could be so an older chap I saw a case just like this not that long ago walking sort of a gentle kind of Hill had a syncopal event and was referred in for assessments got a harsh systolic murmur diagnosis next enosis here so that's the same ECG pretty much isn't it a very similar t-wave inversion left ventricular hypertrophy and that's a normal echo which you've seen already that's a typical sort of echo of somebody with calcific a Oryx enosis with a calcified aortic valve that doesn't move very well and again if your risk stratifying is as as you've said exercise exercised induced syncope that alone should be a red flag as being very very abnormal and in the presence of aortic stenosis that's a significant prognostic marker for a poor outcome without intervention and this slide from up-to-date sort of highlights that quite quite nicely that the moment a patient developed symptoms with aortic stenosis particularly exercise-induced syncope it predicts a high mortality and my point of view should be regarded as a relative surgical emergency that needs to be fixed so we grade severe aortic stenosis based on a valve area under one square centimeter and main gradient over 40 there's a range of other echo parameters but in essence this patient should be seen fairly promptly and almost pretty much most of us have had patience that certainly end up dying on waiting lists for surgery which can be very unfortunate not moving there we go okay next case is a little different so here's a person in their 60s who have had some vague vague symptoms felt a little bit unwell in the morning some sharp sort of chest pain a little bit nonspecific but generally that not feeling quite right and so call the called the ambulance or went to an urgent care center however you want to write it past history of mild Parkinson's bit of hypertension maybe since COPD on a few stock standard medications and when arrives that either you know the clinic or the emergency setting went off to the bathroom and had a syncopal event in the bathroom and was noted to have some jerking movements was rushed back to a cubicle lie down and by the time sort of all the basic obviously done blood pressure was sort of I guess relatively normal and stats were pretty good and looked relatively relatively stable and we were covered quite quite rapidly that's the ECG from this from this patient we thoughts about that regarder now yeah that's not really criteria what's the rhythm that regular or irregular so Regulus that's a F and it's a right bundle branch block pattern ECG so has some investigations have some investigations done and do you guys use high sensitivity troponin here now is that norm for you guys just in the hospitals okay yeah we're we're in pretty mixed bag in Australia as well so slightly elevated white cell counts slightly elevated high sensitivity troponin nothing much on a monitor so I'd be I I just put these kind of mcq type points just for a point of discussion but interested in what people would do at this point any thoughts on the floor or are you missing a piece good question that's a very reasonable diagnostic sort particularly whether with a right bundle branch block and with sharp chest pain I think that would be a very reasonable thing to look for is anybody anybody bothered by that troponin elevation or don't care or sure would what people end up any coagulating for non-stemi or not or still enzymes ok ok alright let's see what happens so I'll just talk of just very for a moment just about just about troponin acids so the there are a range of acids that have obviously been developed over time low sensitivity assays were the original sort of contemporary ones and then the high spender sensitive assays came out and the high sensitivity assays came out the high sensitivity assays essentially pick up typically it's 90 95 percent of people should have some sort of detectable level of troponin so I should have one you should have one and if I go run a marathon I should have an elevated highly sensitive troponin the key thing in discriminating as to which a say you've got is the unit so nano grams per liter is the unit for a high sensitivity assay versus milliliters which would be a sensitive sensitive assay and this this graphic is put up quite a bit when people talk about troponin and it gives you a sense of the diagnostic categories that people might fall into as they have a rising high sensitivity troponin so remembering that the troponin assay is not a positive or negative test it's not a pregnancy test so you're not pregnant or not pregnant all it really is a probability game that is merged with your history your ECG and your general assessment in terms of what diagnosis they've got and this table from the EFC sort of chest pain or whatever it was the ACS assessment reminds us of the large number of diagnoses that will elevate a proponent and in the era of high sensitivity troponin even more sort of things that are going to have the tips similar one to the it's not the actual case but it's it's a very similar one so interested in the comments on the chest x-ray Sima goes have two yay enlargement of VA order has been suggested it's it's interesting fun it passed the radiologists I wouldn't claim to be an expert at reading chest x-rays anymore and many sort of shrugged his shoulders and a cutter and kind of said well you know pretty build a line on that and maybe unfolded wouldn't take too much too much heat of it and of course this patient did indeed have an aortic dissection and in fact that chest x-ray came from a caronia lace for a patient that had a missed a section and the chest x-ray certainly regarded as being relatively relatively normal and not supporting of that the message I guess is that in the in study syncope can be a presenting feature of 15% of aortic dissections a otic dissections particularly present atypically i had a lady walk into the rooms two weeks ago with some atypical i think it was a soft murmur and otherwise feeling relatively well and we just did we were just asked to do an echo and she had an aortic dissection and I rang her up at home asking her to go to hospital and she said I would visit my sister in the country and can I go tomorrow or maybe the day after it was impossible to convince the coz she felt perfectly well of course she finally went two days later had the CT and had a type a spiral dissection so always keep it in mind so I live away from these higher risk group for the moment and talk a little bit about those are vagal syncope and some related conditions so here's a we go okay so here's a twenty six-year-old lay issues a young lady otherwise fitting well traveling on the train felt lightheaded nauseated a bit dizzy typical sort of vasovagal story had a collapse and was helped by her bystanders but of course she's in a public place so an ambulance gets called and on the ambulance note and from the bystander history there are comments that when she you know hit the deck at the platform or whatever it was that she was getting sort of these sitting and jerking movements and somebody thought she'd had a had a seizure for sure and there was comments about not really feeling a pulse at the time but she's basically going I want to go home I feel perfectly fitting well I'm sure I just had a faint she's alert she's orientated normal examination and that's her 12-lead just interested if anyone finds that it finds that interesting or not really bothered or can't hear you know so the no yeah so she's in sinus and she's got ventricular ventricular ectopic there we go ventricular active so ventricular ectopic s' otherwise they're relatively normal is it relatively normal ECG so finest rhythm bees what did what do people think of this story typical for a vasovagal or don't like the fitting and the you know the witness story show of hands who would be who thinks it's a typical faint hands up who thinks it's something else okay alright so she does have a fairly classic and very classic typical typical story so the right situation the right circumstances the right story we'll think about the bystander component but the risk profile overall with essentially a normal ECG other than some veers is is a low risk is a low risk patient the question is whether those whether that fitting staff they're not feeling a pulse and all the rest of it is significant and so it brings up this issue of whether how do you discriminate sometimes between a seizure and a syncopal event so seizures in particular things that really jump out as being neurologic would be people who've got visual auditory hallucinations sense of deja vu a more prolonged recovery phase or post ecto phase and in the syncope space the seizure activity tends to be much more short-lived they can certainly get myoclonic and tonic sort of might take sort of jerks due to the cerebral hypoperfusion in fact they've been studies where they've done video EEG monitoring of people with syncope and people with seizures given the videos two groups of neurologists and they have a great trouble discriminating which one is a seizure which one is syncope purely on the appearance of of what happens urinary incontinence can certainly happen during days of agels as most of you would probably know and so that idea that that's a discriminator is is sort of untrue and again comes back to those that key sort of story and history fitting with the original diagnosis so here the healthy normals that you're the article student syncopating away there he goes he's taking a little longer than usual there he goes I want you to watch on each of these patients what their movements are like so he's shaking that's the Maya clonus that reliably accompanies somebody who has transient ischemia to their cerebral cortex or it may be the basal gate we're not really sure so she twitches a little bit those are fine examples but you say I can tell the difference well you tell me if you can tell the difference between this guy watch this watch these movements if you're seeing this yourself in the emergency department I would argue this would be difficult to distinguish from a generalized tonic-clonic seizure let alone if we're asking these patients family members who are freaked out watch her she's my pen I mean this is a normal person this is you you can do this too tonight so I actually don't know who did this video now because I found it a few years ago and so if anybody ever knows I humbly sort of acknowledge that it's yours and it's been really helpful I do a lot of tilt table testing and I see that's quite commonly and so it is it is hard to tell you can imagine what a what a bystander or a family member is going to describe and it went for hours doctor such a long time and nobody has a sense of time during a during a crisis so so I think yeah bear all that in mind so I want to move on to another case which is really looking at this concept of unexplained syncope and I specifically talked about that as a distinct group there we go okay so here's a here's a chap who's had a single syncopal event there's no good story there's little memory of the event I collapsed I don't really know much doc the exam was normal the blood pressure's normal nobody witnessed it examinations pretty normal CT brain is normal blood the normal the ECGs normal we all see this right I had a blackout can't tell you anything useful so you know what do we what do we do with that so it's quite quite tricky there is certainly a feeling that you probably need to look into it a little bit more and try to work out if there's any sort of sinister pathology going on I think as a patient gets older look at their overall risk profile general risk factors most of us would probably investigate more aggressively for underlying cardiac disease and one of the things to remember is that in somebody who's got unexplained syncope particularly once it becomes recurrent the probability that you're going to be dealing with an arrhythmic basis for these events is up to 50% and the yield for monitoring is often very very low and these patients can often benefit from implantation of a of a loop recorder as part of their long-term investigation Twitter and yeah so 24-hour Holter monitors have a low yield generally if it's been immediately post event that's often the higher time that you might pick something up but the data in that is not is not robust but it'd be very reasonable to if that patient had had an acute event to at least monitor monitor them for 24 hours along with your basic sort of cardiac workup blank so yep so we can sort of take the vasovagal group and break it up into three sort of components one is the classic vasovagal syncope like girl on the train a typical forms where you're you go through a process of excluding other things you might replicate events with a tilt table test something like that and you form a diagnosis and unexplained syncope which is a different beast where everything is negative and you're really not any of the wiser as to what it's what it is it's just really important not to put that down to a vasovagal but to realize that you could be dealing with with a arrhythmia particularly episodic AV block questions yeah sure that's a metabolic cause of transient loss of consciousness no not a cause of syncope yeah so there's just a question about hypoglycemia and just again making the point that that metabolic that's not cerebral blood flow and it's it's a transient loss of consciousness diagnosis not a syncope diagnosis so here's another young person who had a syncopal pre syncopal event at the photocopier felt dizzy lightheaded because she was at work Oh a Chester called the ambulance got carted into hospital it's got a past history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis no family history of sudden cardiac death as otherwise fairly well we'll see in fire function tests are normal and arrives there's nothing much to find on exam ECGs pretty normal skin to sort of go home set a few hours of monitoring and when she gets up to sort of leave the department her she feels dizzy lightheaded and become sort of tachycardic and goes and lies down again and the nurse does an ECG and it looks relatively normal interested in thoughts about that yeah so quite suggestive of Pops's and it makes you sort of wonder about that so I'll skip that would you do stuff so patient gets not uncommon Lee obviously these patients sometimes particularly when they present more acutely really struggle to sort of go home and they don't uncommon Lee not uncommon Lee end up getting admitted and it's also not uncommon of course that they go through a workup and they might get a septic screen and somebody might think they've got a PE and they get a CT PA and get an echo and so on and what would that may be very very reasonable screening for feos and checking their meth eye roid and so on and so forth [Music] postural blood pressures are very important generally postural tachycardia syndrome patient should not be hypotensive they're usually normotensive or hypertensive along with the tachycardia and so this is kind of my schema I suppose for for pots but in essence a heart rate rise of sort of 20 to 30 beats per minute over baseline on standing or sustained for more than a hundred are more than 120 beats per minute and it needs to be sustained that so it's not just the initial initial rajasthan these pshhh patients for at least five minutes and see what happens over that time the constellation of symptoms for pots patients is myriad there's often an overlay with chronic fatigue depressive illness anxiety disorders irritable bowel they often get heat intolerance complain of brain fog and difficulty concentrating an incredible challenge to to manage and I sort of set up a schema of sort of disorders of circulatory control and so you've got patients with vasovagal syncope patients with parts patients with autonomic failure and patience with with initial orthostatic hypotension which is a transient fall and blood pressure that people get for a few seconds on standing and is regarded as a normal variant in blood pressure fluctuation so it's the sort of person that will go how every time I get up I go black and it goes gray and it lasts a few seconds and it's gone something wrong with me and almost always they've got IOH initial orthostatic hypotension and it's a normal subset of the population so that's that's part to learn I'll move forward because I think one short of time so I've got a few couple of last cases and then obviously happy to chat further but here's a 70 year old patient who's had a syncopal or a few syncopal events and doesn't really get any warning about what what happens and in fact had a laceration to the head about sort of skull about six months earlier following a collapse got a past history of hypertension and is on a few anti hypertensive pills obviously we'd get a little bit concerned about the hypotension drugs and maybe there's a component of postural hypotension or drug-induced pathology but here's the ECG so again what what do you guys see on the ECG left bundle branch block sinus rhythm left bundle branch block so taking it a step further recurrent syncope ECG with left bundle branch block thoughts about diagnosis or actions is it new that is a really really good question let's assume we don't know because he didn't bother to present for the for the last ones okay why would you admit so presumes knew and admit yeah sure what would be so you want to admit do a whole lot of tests would you have a particular sort of let's assume that is echo is normal it's got a normal set of blood and he's not let's assume that he's presented to you after the syncopal then a month later so we're not talking about an acute let's assume it's not an acute event any further thoughts on Diagnostics or what people would do so we want to look at Congo on congruence of the of the complexes you're thinking about about MI okay all right but it's not an acute not an acute presentation you could see T is head everyone gets a CT of their head and they get KEF Triax own don't they and a CRP and a troponin so yeah you could do a CT of their head what would you be a subarachnoid year looks possible so all of those things are possible but I guess this guy's walked in it's with it's a month post so it's great to sort of work through all of those things obviously as with all of these things I've got to sort of cut through kind of message so one is a left bundle and syncope is automatically a high-risk patient for cardiac syncope and if you look at studies of bundle branch block in patients presenting with syncope the probability of it being a rhythmic when you once you've excluded other major pathology is astronomically high and although there's no doubt the left bundle is associated with heart failure and cardiomyopathy and ischemia in this sort of age bracket and you would go on and investigate for that stuff if all you did was stick a pacemaker in you probably get it right almost three-quarters of the time according to the stats which is not bad bad odds so you'll get it's not uncommon to see patients with left bundle who you work up you don't find anything but they're having think a bit in that setting I think it's very reasonable to put in a pacemaker on spec in in essence because that's a pretty good hitter and the last thing you want is the fractured not or falling through the bathroom sort of window so let's skip that so back to football players because I like football players so this this case was a nice one that was presented at the ESC maybe two years ago I think so young guy playing football had a syncopal event on the football field and as so one of your colleagues pointed out exercise induced syncope during during sport is particularly particularly troubling he's not doing drugs is not a medication he gets drug screening all that type of stuff looks after himself there's no family history of sudden death which is very important coach kicks in off to hospital flavor of the day of course still ECGs in a history which is which is critical and assessment interested in your thoughts on this ECG if you saw this in your urgent care center anyone so what do you think of thee so there's ventricular ectopy what do you think about where it you where it's located are on T great fantastic so that's a that's a critical critical thing so you remember the ves from the other patient we're quite discrete from the T wave so this is a I guess a classic sort of our on TV II and you could just pick that up and go couple of these work pretty well young guy that's fine we'll send him on his way but in fact this ECG tells you that this patient is at high risk and so did the story so those two key messages exercising jus syncope abnormal ECG so it's got so these are what you know short sort of coupling sequence really between the between the V PC and the and the T wave which pretends a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias so I'll skip those I guess you know I'm sure everyone would now admit the patient so let's move to see what happened that's what happened that's bad so this patient ended up obviously developing polymorphic VT and you can see that in the changing sort of axis that kind of slowing sort of flowing tides not quite not sort of not quite 200 almost this torso doesn't it so that's sort of obviously very very troubling and could result in death so if we look at different forms of VT just as a very sort of broad descriptor monomorphic VT classically occurs with structural heart disease of various sorts with a particular focus within the ventricle but it may be ischemic polymorphic VT when you've got a normal QT is often triggered by a schema and in a younger person you might be worried about a normal of coronary vessels for example polymorphic VT with a long QT you've got a really look obviously the cause of the long QT but the critical therapy to start instituting in that setting is IV magnesium there are plenty of cases where people have seen VT and long QT and have given amiodarone and caused on more VT because they blow out the QT so important not to make that make that common mistake and it doesn't matter what the magnesium you can pretty much if you see it you can just start giving high doses of magnesium so in a young person who's had polymorphic BT there's lots of sort of rare and intriguing diagnoses that we think about including things like myocarditis sarcoid Brugada right ventricular dysplasia all those sorts of all those sorts of things people can also develop it as a just a primary electrical problem and it really then falls into the domains for the EP cardiologists to look at but as I understand it and I'm not an EP cardiologist that these that come from a focus classically within the Purkinje fibers are often can be quite unstable and often trigger this sort of this sort of pattern now this case had a whole series of additional sort of complications with refractory VT and storm and getting ablated and so on and so forth but I just wanted to give you that initial message about the ECG and the and the history and you've already saved the patient's life because you didn't send them home and you get them to the right center for for assessment David how am I going with time okay so I just wanted to finish off by talking a little bit about two drug-induced long QT and obviously again can cause sort of malignant arrhythmias and may present occasionally as think could be hopefully not a sudden cardiac death but can do and this is this is obviously tosod the classic arrhythmia that complicates QT prolong gation and an important condition to try to treat and avoid essentially so QT prolongation was recognized up to maybe a hundred years ago with as a consequence of quinidine but really started to become known in the 60s with quinidine procainamide and dye so pyramid has three key cardiac drugs that both cause long QT and were associated with VT which eventually got recognized or described as tall Assad in the 1990s many of you will recall the issues with turf in Edina and related antihistamines causing long QT and sudden death and it's really for in the 1990s and Beyond where there's been this surge of recognition of QT prolongation secondary to drugs and we've had antibiotics and a range of other medications increasingly recognized as causing this problem and clinical trials in that area and onwards started mandating the assessment of QT prolongation as part of drug development and safety reviews can the credible meds is the kind of key kind of website where information about drug-induced long QT is held can I just can I get a show of hands who's familiar with credible meds and who would you who uses it but look I did I talked about this a few days ago with a group of psychiatrists and GPS in in Melbourne that 50 or 60 of them I got one person as well so for the gold-standard site that is free to access and that everyone is meant to use it doesn't seem to have got its name out there very well which is a bit unfortunate credible meds is a us-based group I guess they're independent of farmer and they're funded through grants I think from the NIH and the University of Arizona they basically have a committee large group of people they peer-review all of the material that comes through and they are the gold standard reference point now for all the warnings on QT prolongation with with drugs and it's the go-to kind of site covers initially excited by covering mainly US drugs but also now recognizes stuff that comes in non-us markets these are just a couple of screenshots from the site so as I said before you can register for free they give you email updates on your drugs you can search them it's very easy to to use I was having a play with it the other day and it categorizes the various risks of patients they've got full sort of lists and links to PubMed and so on and so forth so the QT interval is often vexed with measurement errors so we often rely on the computerized measure but that is frequently wrong so it's really really important that you all get used to measuring it if you're reading ECGs in your day to day Urgent Care sort of setting which I'm sure you I'm sure you are so the definition of QT prolongation is more than four hundred and fifty milliseconds in men and more than four hundred and seventy milliseconds in women and there are a couple of mets methods of measuring it but in essence it is from the onset of the QRS or the either so the onset of the Q wave or or or R wave depending on what comes first and the end of the T wave and the tangent method is probably better regarded than the first but either is good and essentially what you're doing is taking a tangent of the steepest part of the T wave slope and intersecting that with the T wave baseline and that is the measure of your qt and you should do measurements from a few leads v5 and v6 are often quite good and if you do three or four and averaged them out that's a pretty reasonable way of doing it but you can imagine that computers and computer algorithms can easily get this and you may find you need to repeat your ECG a few times to get a clearer and easier to read trace if you've got a lot of motion artifact in it movement it's going to be hard to read and you're going to get it you're going to get it wrong there's just an example of a corrected QT or 510 milliseconds in a hypomagnesemia patient and these things are obviously important to recognize so there are formulas to correct for heart rate as heart rate goes up QT should shorten as heart rate goes down QT will lengthen whatever formulas are reasonable it's sort of said that the zet formula one at the top doesn't correct so well when you get a heart rate over a hundred and maybe the other correction is a little bit better but in essence on a lot of the apps like MD calc and all the rest of it you can put these in your phone and they'll help you calculate according to different different methods so when does QT prolongation really become an issue anything with a 500 plus increased risk of malignant arrhythmias the other thing is to look for a change in the QT so something that goes up by 60 to 70 milliseconds from whatever the baseline for the patient is also portends a higher risk of of tall sod and an obvious and the and the cellular sort of mechanisms that kind of drive that are due to abnormalities in the potassium currents that help to repolarize the the t road but mechanisms are not fully not fully understood so credible meds has a risk categorization so there's known risk possible risks conditional risk and risk associated with in the congenital long QT syndrome essentially known risk patient or known risk drugs are ones that will cause long QT and or sod in normal dosing whereas conditional risk will usually cause long QT but not clearly seen to cause tosod in recommended dosing conditional risk requires some additional factors and additional factors might include other drugs that prolong the QT or metabolic derangements like hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia whatever it might be so there are a range of factors that can that can play in I put a couple of lists up here these are not exhaustive drug lists by any stretch but highlight some common drugs that cause long QT and on the left with the known risk group you can see amiodarone and sotalol we bandy that round like lollies water along with this from my sin and various other things that we use and these things are quite strongly associated with long QT until side and given the volume of patients getting it there are potentially many thousands of preventable deaths due to these drugs so I sort of urge you to sort of always give keep these things in mind you can see from this graphic highlighting the surge in the number of drugs that are potentially issues for long QT and tour sod particularly in the last sort of 15 to 20 years and this graph which I also thought was interesting that the cardiovascular and mental health space which certainly a you know dominant areas that we all look at these drugs have high propensity to to cause issues so always think about other factors that would play in all the hypose will contribute so magnesium calcium and Kaylee Nia bradycardia increases it and patients that have developed renal dysfunction been put on diuretics have underlying heart disease and so on are going to be at higher risk as well so you should always consider that when there are drugs that play think about your drug interactions and and changes in the clinical state of your patients and I think the other thing to remember is it can be quite idiosyncratic so you can have a patient that's been a stable on say flecainide or cycle or some such thing for a long time and at some point down the track may blow their QT and develop to Assad and it's true with the psychiatric drugs as well so I think some vigilance is required and regular ECGs for these patients is - is important I thought this is it this paper from Jax I think you guys get the slides but it's a nice summary of that whole kind of area just published a few months ago or last year and it even talks about handheld QT monitoring devices through smartphones being on their way so there's lots of technology that might come forward that might help us in managing our patients so sort of conclusions I think if I can get back to basics the history is really really important in any patient the u.s. s with syncope drilling down on the story the timeline of events the circumstances and really trying to work out the diagnosis and I would suggest to you that about 90% of the time you can make your diagnosis on a history alone and as part of risk assessment is that history the exam and the 12-lead ECG will cover you for the vast majority of cases and you want to focus on that stratification am i dealing with a low-risk patient who can go home and be assessed in time by their regular doctor or am i dealing with a high-risk patient that needs admission and potentially more specialized assessment so stop there and if there's time happy for questions [Applause]", "LiND6E2w6kc": "these scorpion can be mine is swabian sucker wait a dumb man we got to eat meat from the on the skype is I think ingredients let's go Sarah I'm so scared in a hospital flavoring and Holly yellow five blue one okay so it's a real skirt being inside and it's a good type of scorpion a little

"E_HWDx6stfk": "other everyone's aware of this this web says a rot updated in run by the local consultant single high school wwp ET org the reason I draw your attention to some quite handy things for you the probably more significant of these as an opioid those converter and well if you've got patients on taking a variety of things or single agent you want to do a conversion you can put in the doses of all the drugs and then it will give you a nice handy conversion without twenty five percent those reduction so it's quite a handy thing to and there's lots of other resources including all these it talks uploaded to this website so if you ever miss any you can always come back in refresh so just to give a an update on the drugs and medications that we use in a chronic pain service I'm just going to push through and touch one most of them and with a bit of gonna focus on author the guidelines particularly the same guideline and what is recommended so before Binford's just quickly go through a bit of a history of analgesia see pictures here the one level on the left as well Oh tree and the bark of which spawned the advent of aspen and the picture in the middle is called tar and that is the rustics a precursor to paracetamol eventually and on the right we've got a poppies which we all know as where opium and morphine came from so opioids earliest reference is about 3000 BC a Sumerian civilization of our advanced civilization around the Euphrates River the Persian Gulf and referred to as a joy plants or was recreational before there was medicinal ancient Greeks used it for both medicinal and recreational purposes and then it's a long time between then and is a relatively modern era with the imported this laudanum and to Europe which was opium with 40 percent alcohol and the bomb of the time and so as it was used obviously medicinally as well but often for recreational and misused Pops's morpheme is isolated from opium in 1800s and then certainly 1800s and buyeth german company manufactured diamorphine as a non-addictive alternative to morphine a called heroin and it was discovered to be more potent and more addictive and so also it's mentioned it was back to 1500 BC Egyptians noticed that fever reducing qualities of the well bark Hippocrates used a will apparel to treat headache then extracted south and from willow bark which then got a synthetic version acidosis salicylic acid again made by buyer which is this a parent non-steroidal anilines which is origins of paracetamol so drug dispensing era which a for treating intestinal worms and they discovered the coal tar was an effective reducing fever by oh what a die producing company and they use lots of cool Tardos quilt our waste products and so they the wonderful they could do with it and they developed a fan a certain and that was the that was the change of the bios company from being a die producing company to be and that there's no company and acetaminophen was developed but found not to be as effective as other regions but it really became popular when concerns about GI side effects of aspirin grew and those were fee you know some entity of our g64 for many years were all be familiar with the WH all analgesia DAF which developed in the nineteen nineties by the clock prescribing giving the right drug the rate doors at the right time it's an expensive strategy it's very effective was developed for a treating cancer pin and it's been adopted into treating all sorts a pin but you see there's only three steps through there on the slider and it's not very versatile and if it's feeling effective at stage two they're still on too strong opioids which is a dangerous place to be those are different versions of the analgesic ladder and just don't if you can read it text at the bottom but there's a new model which is an analgesic platform so at the bottom there's two minutes which involve no medication and if you have to use so non opioid medications and other treatments available things physiotherapy psychology these kind of things and then you can take it off and up but there's more options at each level and that's probably more appropriate model for today's you know so we're just gonna go through the principles of pharmacological management of pain and drug treatment pharmacological management is really only one piece of the pie and it's important to discuss limitations of treatment with patients and trying find out that expectations and if patients expect and complete pain relief and the drug Allah gives on 30% pain relief then they may view as a failure and you view as a success so it's important to manage expectations and being aware of the efficacy side effects review your patient regularly reassess and offer reassurance and an important strategy we often see in the pink Anika's patients on multiple analgesics all of which they describe as being an effective anomie well being effective at some stage but if a drug treatment as an effective it's wise to discontinue it if you so it's not even talk to any drugs basically mention about a physiology of pain and four main processes that transduction is real physical or chemical war heat stimulus is turned into an electrical signal just transmitted to the central nervous system into this the dorsal Horn crosses over up the spinothalamic tract where it's perceived and then those descending modulation from higher centers no these are all areas where we can interfere with the pin process pharmacologically so we'll talk about them variety of agents topical agents non opioids to opioids anticonvulsants night of the presence these are the broad categories of talks that we would we would use also going to mention a little bit of interactions and as we go through talked about some of the guidelines that are available it's very I been my background is actually in their primary care and I don't know how limited we can be with things which are formally non-formulary so as you go through the talk I'll get to symbols if it's any tailor Glasgow and Clyde everything across its then the formula T let's go across it's not and if there's any special things that be a brackets next to it okay so um topical analgesics there's a range of options capsaicin there are three different strengths low strength creams which is 0.025 and 0.075 generally speaking the low strength gym as in the bincer antenor set to for osteoarthritis and these are things there's slightly strongest team is generally made to be more anti new neuropathic but they're both the same when you look at the studies was much stronger preparation which is an 8% patch corporate tender so we'll talk about by then not going to really talk about Derby fashions there in the s-saying guidelines but the I'm not a great deal of evidence to tissue that there of the defect and lidocaine patch is something we quite often use we'll talk about with that talk about the topical NSAIDs and it that mentioned gabapentin as a topical treatment this weird then using a glass cool but in Forth Valley they were doing a trial of using gabapentin AQ and those evidences they're useful involved there now and stop mate come up in the future so capsaicin it's the active ingredient of Chili Peppers and there's a selective agonist the trip v1 receptors on nociceptors and a delta and C fibers it's a um so novel treatment can be quite difficult to sell to a patient sometimes you're going to put chili pepper on my skin okay why often see if the patient sick it kind of I'm not sure how effective is but if they know someone who can eat hot curries and perhaps they can and it's that is taking it really hard curries they've been desensitized in those receptors over a number of years and that's what this the effect we're trying to get with using the capsaicin as continuous stimulation of these receptors to don't regulate them and you get a noodle degradation and I'll show you just a picture of that so this is really won't maybe school picture offer of a skin and that's the baseline showing up the in there fibers and then this is seven days following treatment with em that ends up actually you can see that the the number and and the amount of neural tissue is actually less and it's receded from the epidermis so we know no outlet that definitely works um okay so there's the low dose cream the point zero to five and zero seven five is in the formula very few control trials the evidence shows there's a benefit over placebo in patients with osteoarthritis so it can be useful across to a flight as the needs or RC of lightest of the hand joints there's conflicting evidence about neuropathic pain and so in the st. Galen doesn't actually make a recommendation for using neuropathic pain for the low dose team the recent Cochrane review of the OPSEC study suggests that there is some benefit and in Europe a thick paint worth of either the Lord o supreme person humbly did tree of sex and Cebu you often use capsaicin cream as an option given that it's apart from our it perhaps a skin editing effect there's variable side effect profile so even in patients who may not get a huge benefit we'll still give them a trial and how those patches is recommended in the same guidelines and having us a significant benefit over placebo particularly post herpetic neuralgia with on our money 3007 also HIV neuropathy this are all number needed to treat and but despite the benefit which can be a long-lasting expensive and needs specialist initiation an application normally and at the hospital setting and we usually apply it by first marking over the area of pain applying some local anesthetic Jim first of all because it's very very elephant and we use the rule applies to a teaching to go beyond the margins of the credits or would then applied if you by apply their patch with gloves and then live on theirs even using local anesthetic in some patients who find it intolerable very quickly I will try and reassure them and but some pages we just have to take it off take off others tolerate it better and just useful useful even for participating in our journey HIV neuropathy and we've good more experience using it and then post herpetic neuralgia um lidocaine patch a 5% plaster that's in the formula but it's lesser than those specialist initiation um it's got a juju affected box sodium channels to interrupts the pain transmission from nociceptors to the central nervous system there's also quite cooling and soothing then if anyone's ever tried one I had one go on my arm and it's really quite nice yeah and I can imagine if something's saw that you know it's a two-minute patient patients would like it's really it's licensed for books are petty you know our job which there's significant benefits over placebo but there's not really any real evidence for other indications or limited evidence for other indications we will find that we suggested contained a time for for patients who don't have poster pet in your house or have other neuropathic pain conditions and probably even for that is it's got a variable side-effect profile as a treatment which patients do like and if it avoids us going for a strong opioid then it can be quite can't be useful but then it's only in the formula for post-op hitting your knowledge uh so maybe that'll expand in the future you can apply up to three plasters and set turbos on two hours off a treatment so practicalities of using it um for example if you want if you can on your food quite difficult to fit on junuh day so my species to maybe bit on in a tank so it can be different we practical things which need to be sorted out to use it saying gay things recommended for you some poster petting you know Alger but only with another fast line therapies of field and they don't give a recommendation for any other indications and topical nonsteroidals most evidences for topical deco fennec but that's not in the formula for as in the formulary as peroxy Cameron kita proven and there's no difference in efficacy with topically applied non steroidal compared to to oral and they've got a better GI say the effect proof room which is comparable to placebo so for patients who have you know reflux or upper GI symptoms is an appropriate appropriate treatment and and they recommend for use particularly when normally it is not not tolerated and obviously it's probably useful for particular areas of the body if someone's got widespread musculus little plane you can't expect them to put G me everywhere so again it's got some practical implications when you talk about some tablets now um particularly mentioned non-opioid analgesics policy tomorrow nonsteroidals again cox-2 inhibitors and a Neff upon and not gonna mention never Pam and him really anymore it's not in the base was mentioned in the saying go thanks but there's no studies or anything to back up its excuse and it can be misused so Neff apparent something which wouldn't be recommended as a as a useful choice for non-opioid analgesics the paracetamol M as useful south-central Cyclops do you need inhibit also reduces central prostaglandins and that's how it exists it's pink killing and and and I think effect although no one's actually proved that satisfactorily it doesn't really have a peripheral anti-inflammatory action and this end the formula as you would expect that a cheap medication but it's a the tablet is preferred you know that the effervescent the spaceball ones are discouraged but part of the reason for that is this the effervescent dispersible ones have got very high so within content of eight grams and if you that's higher than the recommended daily intake of sodium so if you've got a patient who's hypertensive and you're the one effervescent tablets I could be one way to discourage them from promise to say you know this is such a high sodium content were it's going to be counterproductive in treating your hypertension but they should only be really reserved for people who have proper swallowing difficulties and it's saying guidelines the indicators a small benefit over placebo for osteoarthritis and that the recommended it should be considered either alone or in combination with known stories for osteoarthritis once the Royals primary reaction is an inhibition of cyclooxygenase and does to the oceans of the Cyclops Jeanne's enzyme one being the constitutive enzyme to being the inducible form the constitutive one is protective in GI tract and you may have it's also protective for your kidneys and the prostaglandins are important for real vascular tone and also expressed and platelets important in platelet aggregation the enzyme that's blocked and for most orders as they say option is enzyme when on the left there blocks production of prostaglandins process icons and from balk scenes but this is the the whole pathway you can see if you block that path fee probably there's more substrate and down the opposite path we producing more look at rains and this is thought to be the mechanism why you here and exacerbations of asthma for patients who have sensitivity to non-steroidal this is probably a bit more information than we need them but this is just a diagram of how a non-selective a non-steroidal inhibits the enzyme and it's a small molecule we can get inside their booth cox-1 and cox-2 embark on a Kidani acid whereas crops - for example silicon of this crap there's a big molecule can get into cox-1 and but he can get into cox-2 and that's how it selectively differentiates between the two and you've had a bit this study about Rafa Crocs herb is a big study to look at the side effects of Rafa Crocs have compared to naproxen and this the main reason why they Rafa it was a withdrawing although that sure that there was less GI complications with the cox-2 inhibitor of aprox if there was a 4-time leg piece and myocardial infarction although the overall what I'll today was was similar it was eventually withdrawn and other nonsteroidals and cox-2 inhibitors also shown to have increased risk of myocardial infarction card our death but naproxen seems to be the exceptions for naproxen that appears to be is safe in that regard side effects role of a familiar with the side effects gastric complications reading I just mentioned coronary heart disease renal impairment bronchospasm and there's other miscellaneous things same guidelines would suggest that was moneth modern modest benefit patients with low back pain and musculoskeletal pain compared to placebo but the important thing is to consider gastrointestinal cardiac arrests before commencing is quite common to prescribe up proton pump inhibitor and there's no guidance on who should have a proton pump inhibitor to cover those throws but that generally if over 65 certainly should got a history of reflux or also GI symptoms we would and if you've been if you're prescribing the maximum those who's commonly ibuprofen see 400 milligrams but if you're given a 600 800 milligrams certainly give a proton pump inhibitor to cover that or for prolonged periods so if you're prescribing nonsteroidals for for several weeks and it certainly could prescribe a proton pump inhibitor and so what's on so there's lots of NSAIDs on the formula didn't list them all but the the preferred list includes these three ibuprofen let's get the lowest GI side-effect profile the non-selective NSAIDs and this is also one of the more useful ones from a pain point of view naproxen is at the lowest risk of cardiac events of someone on that long term and it's a useful one to consider the celecoxib as the as a selective cox-2 inhibitor on the preferred list although I'm generally reserved for patients with inflammatory joint conditions okay so milling to opiates to opiate or opioid opiate there's a naturally occurring occurring substance and opioid is a broader term which includes all all substances including since in synthetic ones we've all got an endogenous opioid system which is important for a number of functions yes all these functions so and it's important for a pin perception for sleep regulation stress gastrointestinal function your immune system helps you to Lam actually feel good gives you is important in controlling your appetite and so so although I didn't dare put a Google image on it's important porn and sexual function as well so instead ranges functions which can go of control if someone develops a problem with with opioid misuse so there are various opioid receptors and most of them regularly some analgesia new opioid receptors responsible for physical dependence no reason to mention the receptors there's a another type of opioid receptor called nociception it's berry similar to the classical clawed receptors but it has pool nociceptive and anti analgesic effect it's got ruling tones to opioids and it's a area which will be of interest probably quite far into the future and the treatment of pain and to do to develop nociception AG antagonists which hope hoping would with either treat pain on their own and help with treatment of tolerance or used together with an opioid to reduce the the overall those of an opioid so that there can end the pipeline for the future and tolerance is a big problem with opioid analgesics and Mister finders a decrease in the pharmacological response following repeated or prolong the administration it can be metabolic as and you tab lies the drug differently over time or can be functional they can be cellular mechanisms and adaptations which mean that the drug is less effective over time that may be internalization of receptors or changes within the cells themselves and it's just that a graph of what period receptor sensitivity over time and then there is a graph of tolerance and adult response so even after after a week there's Torrance will started to develop and you can still get the same response but to get the same response it needs to be a higher concentration of the of the drug that's one of the major drawbacks of of opioids most of the month ago phase 1 metabolism in the liver morphine doesn't the reason I mentioned metabolism is that them it can lead to polymorphisms of or inter-individual variability and the way things are metabolized particularly with codeine you beware of rapid metabolizers get quite good analgesic response to cooling and poor metabolizers get who around easy responsiveness is don't - a cytochrome p450 - two years and that enzyme is inhibited by ASUS our eyes so if someone with quite a lot of patients are on to tau from fluoxetine and that can interfere with heavy a metabolites and drugs excreted being released so metabolites which are an active and hydrophilic can lead to toxicity so morphine if someone's good we know feel more things probably quite a bad choice lipophilic drugs with an active metabolites are probably more effective or more appropriate okay these are the video I'm gonna just get past them okay so a desirable qualities about an opioid the one which from a chronic pain perspective a long-acting preparation and immediate release preparations are more prone to misuse and can increase your risk of they accelerate tolerance and dependence and we want one which is effective at a low dose and choose preparations which I have a low potential for from su so thanks to a long-acting tablets transdermal and certainly no injectable therapies the common preparations which you use a coding week opioid which I've mentioned has variable metabolism the head recording again we call power within the formulated tramadol is in the form early but it's not first-line it's got a separate mode of action which is noradrenaline reuptake inhibition enhance serotonin release which can be useful when you to Pathak ping MST and obviously cool down the power the mainstay of the strong opioids that we would use the morphine's chip to Everly dozing in reliable oxycodone has got better bioavailability than than MST other preparations issues transdermal preparations fentanyl again it's in the formula but not fast lane Bipin often view trans patches or some something which we will recommend fairly regularly probably less regularly now than we did but they are not and the the formula formula M attraction or using buprenorphine is that there are doses which are a you know that stronger than than what you would be able to offer and I we call pro but not as strong as as a full step the opioid to the skin of a nice middle ground and the transdermal was go so low low risk of a or low potential for misuse but that that has its own controversy cuz they're not they're not in the in the formulary and quite often who may suggest him and they're not being prescribed we can talk about that at the hint and depends at all as has been started and and lesser than the formula as a specialist initiation and that's um again it's got noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors if you can imagine it's a bit like trauma dog bite instead of being a step to upload as a step three opioid we've got a little bit of experience used in that and it's reserved for patients who have been on one been on at least two opioids before either MST and oxycontin on a misty and fentanyl and had problems either with them have been an effective or intolerable side effects and we've had probably about 30 to 40 percent success rate it was to pentathol and method 1.soak not something to use frequently at all it's got an extra effect has been an NMDA antagonist and by saying I don't have a lot of experience using using meth don't abuse occasionally to do use it and was it seeing the same guidelines does suggest we should be and using strong opioids they are considering them for patients who have a long-term painful condition such as low back pain and osteo arthritis but the important thing is to start them as trial on a trial basis only to continue them with us ongoing pain relief and involves regular review and the regular review needs to be a system in place to pick up the signs of misuse so we've in classical we've got the GGC opioid prescribing guideline which is available and the pinned at a-- website and i think it should have been the same if it's through primary care and it really reflects all of the stuff and the BPS guideline they all pros for proposition pink okay so moving on to other medications who've frequently used anticonvulsants useful when treating neuropathic pain which is the vein they're defined as pain resulting from a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system broadly fall under two categories calcium channel blocker which gabapentin and the formulary feed to use and pre goblin again which is Anna for me but not Leslie there's been a frost line agent and the other broad category of sodium channel blockers of which carbamazepine is one which was occasionally occasionally used but mostly for treating trigeminal neuralgia so it's gabapentin there's no commonly used as superior possible as long as you're given daily doses of at least 1200 milligrams number needed she of 6.84 abroad to canopy of neuropathic pain conditions post petting your alger painful diabetic neuropathy and makes you to Pathak pin there is some evidence of benefit in fibromyalgia although there's no fun recommendation in this same guidelines under said it should be considered for patients with a neuropathic pain so broad broadly speaking it's a general neuropathic pain adverse effects aren't important things about adverse effects with gabapentin they often occur first before you get any analgesia and business somnolence or the common ones they get disturbances as possible but one that people were most worried about is swelling weak in peripheral with the amounts boat the incidents about spokes are eight to ten percent titrate it does be recommend two different titration regimes one would be East and 309 grams three times of the increasing Optimax of 3604 elderly or there are concerns about side effects a patient's worried about side effects we would see well let's start at 100 milligrams and Taichi up and up 100 milligrams steps pre Kaplan's very similar and take up a painting although it's more potent and they're possibly fewer side effects and it's been shown to be superior to placebo doses of 300 milligrams and above and it does is lordos is 150 milligrams is not as effective there's some evidence of benefit for patients with chronic pancreatitis that's a very difficult group of patients we could often see them at the the pain clinic and they're very difficult to treat and the there are some evidence coming out that the this may be a useful useful treatment and reducing the pain intense chronic pancreatitis and listed in the BNF is another indication of pre Goblin as generalized anxiety disorder and so that sometimes if I'm choosing between gabapentin pregabalin if someone that has generalized anxiety disorder which is not treated by other means made knows me to zero was try three carbons instead of the pies or foster adverse effects are very similar and again can I cut before you get up again or teaser just listen same guidelines recommended that it's useful for you know Pathak pain but not as fostering and also has a recommendation for treatment of fibromyalgia and the titration regime for assist start 75 milligrams twice daily and increase after seven days and you can start of the war and those is less than 150 are often not affected um antidepressants they broadly fall under three categories tricyclics which are mature to the north we know the ones who use the Moose as the SNR ice M which of which duloxetine as the drug of the Moon and SSRIs fluoxetine which is it's a classical one for using in fibromyalgia now it is the action of antidepressants is mainly due to the nor adrenergic effects rather than this sarah phonetic effects through the tricyclics and the snr ice appear to be more effective than it than the SAS alright these things not surprisingly could be a little benefit there for things like wall back pain the more useful in treatment and euro Pathak taping there is some benefit in five miles off with dry cycle kind of the presence and in particularly if those are a sleep disturbance as a major component of the fibromyalgia and that's finished probably most useful and as superior to possible and of a variety of neuropathic pain stings there's a I'm sure you know was a wide range of adverse effects with try psychic antidepressants and that's don't to multiple mechanisms of action that did not only blog reuptake of Nia means they also got calcium si sodium channels and they've got anticholinergic effects so there's a wide range of of side effects over the a long history of of safety and normal disease not Red Queen has got a better side effect profile than amitriptyline and if someone's has some benefit with amitriptyline good side effects are an issue often a switch turn off trip clean air can be helpful um same guidelines recommend we shouldn't be using them to treat a chronic low back pain but should be considered for five mile journey no Pathak pain and they've mentioned they all just said about no alternative tricyclics for example nortriptyline it can be appropriate to try and reduce the side-effect profile and we would normally have to again two titration regimes one standard ten milligrams and get up in ten milligram increments every three to seven days or once done at 25 and if you're worried about side effects or patients elderly we would go for the for the war titration schedule snr eyes and see there's probably a drug of the moment we could for the least experience with them compared to use an amateur clean and gabapentin and and there are new indications came out for the locks for the Hochstein similar all the time there's evidence of it's been effective a in chronic low back pain reserve and so we've been effective in five major and austin with riotous as well as neuropathic pain states and in the recent sign guidelines said it should be second a third lane for the info diabetic neuropathy but should be instead of a patient with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis all this there's little of marketing approval for but for usin osteoarthritis as in in the guideline um who don't have a great deal of experience using it and osteoarthritis to see or our experiences I'm sure I have more information than I in the future titration regime for this is usually 30 or 60 milligrams up to a maximum of 120 in debated doses so there's lots of different agents which you can use for you know Pathak pin and really i wonder which which one would you go for first you could look at the same guidelines which suggest starting with hammer trypsin and gabapentin and then going for if that's not effective go for pre pre gobble in a second line the gabapentin if they're not effective trying duloxetine um all those nice guidelines which suggests you can offer the patient any one of amitriptyline gabapentin pregabalin what duloxetine in carbamazepine zone therefore really as fast lane for trigeminal neuralgia and of the guys on the clinic had different my take on it is um after the patients get significant sleep disturbance I'll probably pump for something which is hopefully going to give them a better quality of sleep so I'm a typically and if this generalized anxiety and I may go for a pre goblin or if the patient has in Compton untreated depression and you want to give a decent antidepressant mental oxygen maybe use useful it can be if you start treatment with another antidepressant and then add something different then you can probably endure with problems with interactions so that's how I would look at it and if a patient has trigeminal neuralgia would use carbonize of other agents which you can which you can use which you've talked about there topical agent such as lidocaine patches capsaicin and then these things at the bottom are for specialist and poops who I put opioids in there but you know for neuropathic pain we were thinking of putting something on to step three approach we probably like to see them before that happens contains a nipton a shear that in the in the hospital as I called you we'd be easy access to that a noodle modulation as we can get up obtains machine they were talking about advanced you know modulation there may be things like spinal cord stimulators which they we would refer to tell CDC I was before and then we spend too much on interactions just to mention the one that we all worry about is really serotonin syndrome and symptoms can be really mild to can have a bit of agitation headache and could be a bit sweaty and it may not actually be apparent as being a medication problem or a serotonin syndrome probably exists across the community and quite low levels you know if someone's on tramadol I'm a trip Sweden and citalopram they could quite easily have symptoms which could be put down for other things but could could be related to an increased level of serotonin so a simple thing to do is to if you consider it as to look at the medications and perhaps take one of the least effective ones off but it can obviously just be more severe than that in and it's positive must form can be severe life-threatening and so just to be careful when describing per heart multiple medications with a similar effect on on serotonin levels so rattled on about pharmacology painful for a while just like to summarize by seeing really it's only part of the overall management we would like to consider alternatives and non pharmacological therapy really before you're saying to the next level on the WH will be in like that I mean maybe we should be considering it more as a a pain platform telling your therapy to the individual can be useful can take time you know to get things just right but getting agent and for regular review be assessment and given them reassurance will help with that but all guidelines to take ADA's saying produced guidelines nice guidelines bps guidelines local guidelines and and most of the options which are available available to us are in the end there GGC formulary for you to use and if there's anything that's not then it should be available through us in the specialist pain service thank you very much you", "sDQ9LzSjkN0": "he feels it's uni and today I'm back with another video so today's video is going to be a different video it's not a squishy packet it's not even squishy related so I got a package from pick me pops and this is a new toy I have no idea what they are so today we're gonna open this box and we're gonna find out what pick me pops aren't so yeah I already made a cut and yeah okay let's I know what's inside wait what wait what it's a huge loli pod oh oh there's some note it's so cute that is here that pickney pops are a collectible mini plush inside a lollipop waiting to be discovered that it's so cute I can imagine the characters inside it's perfect the package came with I don't know what these are but they seem like paper [Music] I think I need scissors in winter hey let's open it all together there are lots of them oh there are four bones and blind bags oh wait there's so let's start with this one oh my god it's so cute it smells heavenly trust me it smells like actual lollipop so it's really soft and it feels like it has the beads inside there is the one that I got it seems like a cat that is in the way apart pahst you have cute little tail what do you think about this one Mikey I think peanuts like see what is this oh oh it's a cute little toy okay smells like nothing so adorable the pamphlet it's a collector's guide as you can see there are all the characters that you can collect so we got woosh the kitten and she is a common so there are rares ultra rares I got these stickers here is moosh and i believe this one is mum p and as you can see there's like a little envelope inside and when we open it says besties meow and forever and here is monkeys it says you are music to my ears here is the next line back ah we got mom feed guys I swear they smell so good it's it's too good to be true actually so this is mum peed mum peed bunny it's so adorable she has like huge ears and she is in a later part costume as well and she's rainbow so the lumpy is also a comment pick me pop left back here is this one that's for you oh my gosh so I got this cute please oh my gosh it's so cute it smells amazing I can't even stop smelling this so that is everything in this package thank you so much pick me pops for this amazing package it's like a really really cool experience is my first time opening blind bag and it's such an honor to receive these from you so again if you guys are interested in any of these I will put the link down below and let me know what you guys think in these you pop them and you get them or would you not get them all Sybil let me know if you guys want more pick me pops video next time I will not show my face so you can focus more on me actual characters are so good and it's not so so good if you guys like this video give it a huge thumbs up and subscribe to become a pickle bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "L4pU06ewVaQ": "alright welcome to an introduction to cannabis science including medical marijuana dosing and titrating my name is not - coming up it works better if you tie them up there we go my name is Martha Montemayor and a certified nutritional consultants and if I do this before you hear the doctors I have to tell you about my future relationships I am NOT being paid by any drug company or a drug manufacturer to talk to you today I have no financial relationships to disclose sadly the director of a nonprofit organization called hcu education that trains doctors in medical marijuana and I volunteer my time together they also own a medical marijuana evaluation clinic and that is called healthy choices unlimited and I'm sure you've all heard of that I have felt over 20,000 people join the Colorado Medical Marijuana registry probably closer to 30,000 at this point in time in other words if I can't get you on the Colorado Medical Marijuana registry no Social Security no birth certificates exactly I'm also the founder of cannabis clinicians Colorado which is a non-profit professional society that once a month for treating doctors now a lot of offers a conference called marijuana for 2018 let's just get started if you're gonna know some of this stuff already because I'm used to giving this to doctors what your average teenager knows more than your average doctor about cannabis so cannabis and marijuana in the same thing cannabis is simply the botanical name for marijuana marijuana was a name that was added instead of the word cannabis 1930s when it was made illegal to confuse the AMA so they wouldn't realize they were taking away the third most commonly recommended drug in the United States at the time so cannabis is an herbal medicine that has been used since ancient times it is not a magical cure for all diseases I know that the disappointment but sadly it will not cure your male pattern baldness and help your ingrown toenails so everybody makes cannabis compounds themselves we all make morphine within our bodies as well substances are made within the body are called endo that is a prefix for it so just like we have endogenous morphine we have misogynous cannabinoids and they're called endo cannabinoids everybody is making cannabis compounds right now even this DEA agent every mammal on the planet makes their own cannabis compounds in their body now cannabis compounds that come from plants use the Greek word Fido in front of it because phyto means web so those are vital cannabinoids and cannabis plants contain over 400 chemical compounds and 85 to a hundred of those are made only within the cannabis plant so the receptor system in the body that recognizes these compounds is called the endocannabinoid system it's a receptor for both self-made cannabinoids and ones that we get from plants so why do we have an endocannabinoid system well it turns out that the EC s is there to help us from birth to death it is involved in all kinds of body processes it is there to help us with balance homeostasis the endocannabinoid system modulates physiology to help sustain balance within the body all throughout life it helps us with eating and fruits make you hungry and controls appetite it helps us with sleeping it helps us to relax it helps us to forget which is very important you know since times people have needed to forget traumatic events if the carnivorous pig dog is at the mouth of your cave you have to remember your last encounter with him and you have to forget your last encounter with him too or you will never leave the cave to go out and gather food again and it protects our brains so an example of an endocannabinoid moment this is from a quote from Michael Pollan Michael Pollan wrote a famous book called the botany of desire where he talked about for plants and how plants actually manipulate us to do their bidding and one of the plans he talked about it that book was actually cannabis and the reason he talked about it was because of its status as a forbidden plant and there have been other forbidden plants in history as well but an example about cannabinoids have helped us since our hunter-gatherer passed since that carnivorous Pig dog is an example from his book The Omnivore's Dilemma and that is a brain chemical that sharpens the sense those narrows your focus and allows you to forget everything extraneous to the task at hand is a perfect tool for the hunter the reason he was saying this was he was hunting a wild boar in the book he decided he was going to have a meal prepared only from things that he had personally gathered or grown or slaughtered himself is that wild boar hunting and he has this moment he says it was just like being high back in college I had a marijuana moment he says all of his external distractions fell away he was able to more clearly hear the snap of twigs as the pig he was tracking walk through the forest the world seemed brighter and more in focus it he was hungry motivation so the endocannabinoid system is comprised currently of two receptors that we recognize those receptors of the cb1 receptor in the brain and nervous system and the cb2 receptor that is in the mewn system and enemy organs there are up to eight cannabinoid receptors that have been identified now in Israel they talked openly at the cd3 receptor we don't have science on that to show exactly what they're doing but I can tell you this mice then have no cb1 receptors they're called knockout mice that are lacking that receptors that are used for experiments they still recognize CBD so we don't know where CBD is actually binding to by a CB water because mice with no receptor do fine with it it's not binding to CB 2 because we've already proved that so who knows is the answer there's still a lot of mysteries here anyway cannabinoid receptors are part of a family of neuromodulators meaning they regulate nerve impulses they are found on all cells including and down to macrophages which are cells within the blood and that's one of the reasons we think that cannabis affects people at altitude more profoundly actually is because the number of macrophages and how they react and altitude are different and totally adjustment I think that's why many people as you know should take it so the endocannabinoid system is actually the dominant receptor system in the brain and nervous system there are ten times more cannabinoid receptors than our receptors for any other thing it is a huge system it's a shame we haven't where we started you know studying it the way we should so here it is in the brain and nervous system cb1 receptors are concentrated in the basal ganglia in the cerebral cortex in the hypothalamus the hippocampus the spinal cord the medulla the cerebellar they're everywhere and these are the things that they control motor activity motor coordination short-term memory thinking appetite sedation and pain perception and then the the immune cells are mostly regulated by the cb2 receptors and cb2 receptors as you can see are everywhere this is from one of dr. raphael matures papers on the cb2 receptors as a lipid signaling system within the body and lipid means fats what is your brain made of it isn't muscle I assure you a lot of that so the largest organ in your body is not any of these listed here it is your skin we believe that there are cb2 receptors right in the skin which is why we gets such good results from topicals even though they're not penetrating into the bloodstream it appears they are actually stimulating CD 2 receptors in the skin and that is part of the medical effect so why do we need this this regulation leads to disease if your endocannabinoid system is not functioning properly you might feel bad and the cb2 receptor targets are lymphocytes natural killer cells and of course the immune system as a whole there are actually some diseases now that we believe are actually and know can have an assistant deficiency diseases and by that I mean that for example I have migraine headaches right and migraine headaches are thought to be the result of an underactive at endocannabinoids system meaning that my body's not making enough natural cannabis and that is why micro dosing seems to be a thing that worked so well for so many my renewals because I've taken every day you stimulate the body to make its own cannabis and it protects it from getting that disease in the first place so it's either one and cb2 receptors are part of the protective lipid signaling system they help regulate healthy fats and this is why this is so important a billion-dollar drug failure I mean do you know Guinea was stopped by the World Health Organization about ten years ago was called Ramona ban and a blocked the cb1 receptors in the brain so what happens when you block the cb1 receptors well you're not hungry anymore you don't want to eat but you also don't want to live it causes depression and suicidal tendencies and so many people committed suicide or threatening within the study they had to scrap this billion-dollar drug so don't mess around with the cb1 receptor it leads to my favorite onion headlines doctors prolong meaningless existence no reason has got the sound for life here on earth but we're making it last longer anyway thank you the onion back to endogenous cannabinoids medium cannabis ourselves is something our bodies do from birth to death and Anand amide was the first endogenous catenoid discovered by Rafael sure I'm sure you've all heard the name Rafael Shula he's the man who isolated THC in 1962 I think it was rocky Alma showroom is a science a scientist in Israel who has studied cannabis and cannabis only for over 60 years there's a wonderful movie that I do recommend you all watch on you to call the scientist just google scientist who shulam in youtube you'll have an hour of your time well spent and he talks about it in here about first of all isolating THC hundred second of all finding the endocannabinoid system and then his hypothesis was hey the body doesn't make receptors for things you have to smoke why is this system here he must make some ourselves and that began his search for Amanda by which he found after several years of searching he named it after the Sanskrit word for bliss because this is whatever non-dividing seems to give us it's a chemical signaling messenger that works across the neural synapses in other words it's a neurotransmitter it's thought to be responsible for the runner's high feelings as well as the bliss we feel during meditation but it's also found in chocolate the second most important self-made cannabinoids is - Iraq at Donald literal or - AG this is made from an omega-6 fatty acid once again it is found in all animal milk including breast milk so if Jeff Sessions really really wants to stop marijuana in the United States he has to arrest every nursing mother in the country because this be receiving lots of cannabinoids right now and 280 messages on demand through the neural synapses just as anandamaya does because their neurotransmitters so here is the endocannabinoid system hard at work in our synapses in our brain this is a very famous slide so here's the thing about the body though the body makes what it needs where it needs it on demand all of the time it's pretty an amazing thing the amount of brain communication that actually happens in your synapses 2 percent ok so just because cannabis is affecting your mind doesn't mean it's not affecting your body even more than it is your mind so this is for science nerds out there and yes I will affected by cannabis and these are sources of research for examples these protein receptors which are targets from cancer drugs these days of g-protein coupled receptors and these are competitive at high THC concentrations opioid receptors and cannabinoid receptors if we go back to this slide oh they're not on here but opioid receptors and cannabinoid receptors tend to be next to each other but cannabis is not a narcotic it's a non-competitive inhibitor at narcotic receptor sites right so if if you're a narcotic and I sidle up next to you and how the cannabinoid I will say hey baby how are you doing and you'll be like no not interested in you so we'll chat but nothing's going to happen yes lady ion channels are another source of endocannabinoid system targets and that is part of the metabolic system cannabis has a very positive effect on metabolism to the point that in the little booklet that you have in front of you at the handouts I said before everyone you'll see type 1 diabetics who are on insulin you need to be careful with them and starting them on cannabis because it has such a positive effect on metabolism that it reduces the need for insulin and type 1 and type 2 diabetics we can control type 2 diabetes with cannabis and the sugar talked about this when he was in Pueblo last year if you take cannabis every eight hours once you find your dose we can actually control type 2 diabetes fairly pretty well in addition to diet and exercise type 1 diabetics or insulin dependent though they just need to figure out how it affects them because it's going to reduce their need for insulin and they do too much insulin they can crash now our heads are exploding can you please get to the pot smoking for - yes ok so what we've learned so far the endocannabinoid system or ECS is an internal Folio static regulatory system and influences multiple physiological processes gets involved in much of our pub and if you're not annoyed our endogenous agonist of cb1 and cb2 they stimulate those and those are the receptors to which THC also binds using plant candidate cannabis actually stimulates the production of an andhe mind and 280 the ones that we make naturally and this is why do you believe there are no cannabinoid system deficiency diseases is because using cannabis from plants stimulates the body to make natural cannabinoids which can cause many people to come back into balance and last it's part of a lipid signaling system cannabis binds to fats they do not like water you see those CBD waters out there there but that's my personal opinion okay maybe someone has found a way to buying cannabis to water but nature does not like that Thanks they claim to use nanotechnology so is that pump making it smaller doesn't make it fine to water okay that'll mean small and nano shear is where they couldn't you a giant blender to make the molecules smaller they might coexist but it's still I mean the reason you're supposed to drink a glass of milk with the brownie was to add that to give it rather than going to that was not just a you know 70s all right you already know this when we're talking about cannabis we tend to talk about streams we talk about indica sativa ruderalis and help genetically they are variants we had a geneticist come speak to us at our cannabis clinicians group last year and just like two blondes can have a brunette child and two brunettes can have a blonde child and redheads can pop up sort of randomly as we all know about when she tested cannabis plants she could not look at them in terms of indica and sativa the words not nothing anymore because genetically they are so similar so the strain names tell you nothing look at the lab test results we're all used to looking lab test results we're gonna whiz through this pretty quickly THC a and C mediate or the raw acid forms of THC and CBD and the difference is effect with the chemical structure out is there's acid chain on the end carbolic acid and that is why feeding the plant is called carboxylate is it drops that carbolic acid chain off the end of the chemical of the THC or CBD and makes it into what we call equal active form and then we have turbines and turbines are chemically very short little very basic building blocks think of them as the building blocks of essential oils because they're the same fragrances that are in pine trees lavender black pepper up hops they're really the same thing so like I'm allergic to pine trees I try to avoid weeds that smells very tiny to me if it smells like pine-sol yeah so if you're allergic to hops okay let's talk about well nursing is also found in hops it's also found in murd remember frankincense and myrrh and gold or traditional gifts this is the hypnotic mercy is known to cause you know a hypnotic effect a calming effect that's the one that's thought to be more in indica and therefore thought to put you to sleep or immersing is responsible for more of the body hide as well and you can also extract CBD from hops I mean the idea that you've somehow banned marijuana by banning CBD is also ridiculous you also can't be oh just a minute terpenes are actually the fragrance is part of the medical effect of the plant and dr. Ethan Russo Cooper speaks in our conferences on terpenes believes that the cannabinoid terpene interactions you can read it yourself produce synergy that is part of the medical effect the plan and I also believe this very well now when you look at the brain you have three types of chemical signaling messengers in the brain we have neurotransmitters that we already talked about okay and then you've got the other one which is called the molecules of emotion sometime and they're responsible for thirst for hunger they're called peptides peptides responsible for thirst for hunger for sleepiness for alertness is this stuff like cannabis at all so this is where we think the terpenes come in we think the terpene cannabinoid combinations are what's responsible for creating those molecules of emotion and create the joy and the thirstiness the dry eye and right those sort of things at the same time whereas the marrow transplant of ours serotonin dopamine epinephrine norepinephrine those words sound familiar right all cannabis works in the gaba pathway which is a neurotransmitter which allows it to raise dopamine levels which in turn raises serotonin levels which is responsible for many of the medical effects as well so common terpenes so here's the thing about terpenes it's it's the same as cannabis so there is no known correlation between any given doses of marijuana and any given blood level in a person or an affected person everybody has to do it for themselves and even though terpenes are used widely in aromatherapy it's the same sort of thing there have done studies where they've given you know 16 people a 1200 milligram dose of the rule to see if they would relax that they could prove it was an anticonvulsant anti-anxiety and relaxing thing and guess what just like cannabis it was all over the place there was no consistent blood level in anyone and there was no consistent effect in any way so we believe the entourage effect is what's it work here which is the Sun is more the total is it some more of the sum of its parts it's two plus two equals 25 and that's the way it is with cannabis but you have to find what's right for you so myths we hear this all the time I just want to CBD I don't want to be high oh the horror right not men is that CBD is the medicine and THC is a trial it's just for fun entourage effect expense we are just true fiends and cannabinoids into interactions between the categories themselves and with the exception of Delta 9 THC all of the final cannabinoids have a very weak binding action at those cb1 and cb2 receptors they're not selection hours they're a gentle caress to those receptors THC is the only one that binds strongly at all many people get no effect from CBD until some THC is added again and then they get the effect and we're not sure if that's because of cb1 receptor activation or how the entourage effect actually works because once again we have not got mice that the CBD effects anything but for most people activating those cb1 receptors of THC gives them a lot more effect from the CBD if I token Avenue 8 is a plant so even at even at low doses like we have the 20 milligrams of CBD did two milligrams of THC that way that was anything but high but right but that should get in Reverse it's not about getting them high it's about your dating the receptors so that's what we call that's a returning yeah right yeah I call it micro dosing we call it you know a subclinical dose is when the patient does not feel that does have an effect on the body you know so for migraine prevention for fibromyalgia prevention for irritable bowel syndrome giving someone what a sub dopes anywhere between one and five milligrams not enough for them necessarily to feel but enough to take that endocannabinoid system active we can have suits the frequency that they would have the problem we can take someone from 10 migraines a month to one or two we can take them from you know a dozen fibromyalgia outbursts into down to you know one or two again just by doing the micro dosing we can have someone go into complete remission on their IDs if they just take a little bit every day but how do they take it oh let us count the ways this is once again where everybody is different so inhale is the fastest way to get marijuana into your body is to inhale it and there are so many benefits to inhaling there are a lot of it takes effect quickly you feel it within one to five minutes the peak plasma plasmas in your blood so peak plasma isn't in five minutes but it also wears off quickly it's gone I'm going to three hours but that's another nice thing about it so you haven't ruined your whole day if you're trying a new strain just because you know it's an hour and a half there's a ninety nine year old 90% of the cannabinoids on people asthma are out of the blood and spread out through the body within 90 minutes that's enough quickly it disperses basic pot smoking put the plant material in a pipe or a joint laid with a flame and half of it is literally lost to heat and smoke goodbye this is not an efficient method of getting cannabis into your body at all only 10 to 50 percent of the original cannabinoids are present in the smoke and 25% is lost exhale nothing you can do about that so how much are they getting well the experience of this motor actually matters Justin Bieber claimed this was the only time he ever smelled the pot so we're gonna assume he's only 10% bioavailability mark here because breath holds depth of immolation and smoker experience matters we would hope that Bob over here gets a lot more getting here's that rough dosage back to max you like this the World Health Organization says your average joint is three-quarters of a current that is the global average for a joint right so if you take the weight of the drinks time on test results time the bioavailability you come up with how much they're getting so here's our lab test result for this blue dream it's only 13.2% th say it's got a little CBT tiny bit of CBN we're not gonna worry about the CBD so we're gonna take 750 milligrams at 3/4 of a grand joint we're gonna multiply it by 13 point two and then we're gonna give you the benefit of the doubt we're gonna say Bob Marley smoke this so 25% bioavailability so in that whole joint the maximum amount the person can get is just about 25 milligrams that's it it's a very inefficient method of doing this so what happens when you take that it they are super efficient they take 97% of that 25 milligrams and put it directly out into the bloodstream peak plasma levels in two to five minutes steady drop then over the next 60 to 90 minutes and it goes out into the perfuse organs into the fatty organ suppose to the brain to the heart to the lungs to the liver and very little of it converts into above an hydroxy which is what your liver does to it so really it's super efficient the blood-brain barrier is known to be the cause of the delayed effect of my delayed effect what I mean is if you take someone's blood after they take a hit off a joint it's going to show in the blood before they feel the effects in their life they're gonna feel high a little bit later not much but a few minutes and that is the blood-brain barrier they're acting to delay the plasma in cycle activity so vaporizing we're gonna defuse it the same way it's going to come into the lungs and go out into the body the same way but you get a lot more bang for your buck because you don't have half of it literally go up in smoke low temperature electronic cigarettes and quina concept short duration of smoking less waste you know about vaporizing so here's our friend dr. Donald Abrams with his volcano vaporizer right in San Francisco General Hospital that's Donald is a wonderful person who actually put vaporizers right in San Francisco General for his pain studies and this is one of his pain studies a few years back and what he found was measurably higher THC in blood with the vapor versus the smoke it is that much more efficient and the patients liked it better they have better results in vaporizing they thought it was a better way to go you get 60 to 90% of those cannabinoids and favor as opposed to the 50% that we hadn't smelled so right away you've got more you still have the 25% exhalation moss as you have with any inhaled medicine but that same 3/4 of a grin but put in that volcano it's going to give you a lot more bioavailability so what we've got is about 55% file availability rather than a maximum with 25% and that means that we have literally double more than double the amount we have fifty four point five milligrams available from that same 3/4 of a gram but so it's just that much more efficient this is that tested with the volcano or is that just any Mather Isaac it depends on that's a good question because the heat matters and with a volcano you can adjust the heat so that you know that you're not ever burning the product there are other vaporizers that will burn the product and you'll get less yeah we've got some like exactly and I'm gonna leave that up to you because there are so many different types of vaporizers now that I can't keep up you're still smoking though you're still inhaling a new yeah absolute you're like oh I only be who's afraid of the big that's all right so as you know dams are highly thought the concentrated forms of cannabis typically made from cashew like that is actually the single that it concentrates they can be 60 to 90 percent THC and once again thank you world health organization for defining exam is about attempt at a graphic design how about you spewed out of course so here's a dab left as and as you can see the total cannabinoid content on this is eighty nine point five percent as opposed to the previous member we have two thirteen point two percent THC this one is eighty nine point five percent so it's a lot more tolerance and this you would be being used as date rape drugs that is not your some how you're supposed to use that so what we just saw there is an example of what we call medically as no some bagels them could be otherwise known as fainting it is a rapid drop in blood pressure reduce blood flow to the brain the patient turns pale - elet hall's and they think do not hold a Nadab it's not a joint holding in the dab cuts off blood flow to the brain at the same time that you're hitting it with all that THC which accelerates the passing our process so you guys caught that a whiteout I mean way back would come over him yeah and you know they would Pam oh they asked leave it was in that's great to know that ya know that it is with actual medical that way well what you trying to do is cut off blood flow to the brain at the same time that you're hitting it with all that with good because you look Brett pressure lowers rapidly with that much to you see THC is known to lower your blood pressure and raise your heart three terms okay so lowering the blood pressure at the same time that informing your breath will take you skate faster so if you know your tolerance and know you will not think doing this well here's why remember we have that 54.5% THC available in the vaporizing that's a single hit on a dab that's not that whole three quarter of a gram but Nara is that in that one hit that's what we have available if you know you can handle that great that's enough celery baby really doctor exactly why why he's mad so some people say that there is no medical tab used and that's just for fun they would be wrong and we have had excellent results with Deb's for certain really incapacitating episodes cluster headaches severe muscle spasms with our MS patients where they are simply wrong sometimes it down would just relieve that completely migraine headaches when you get the org a little twinkle you know it's coming sometimes taking it to have can save you days okay and epileptic or epileptics tend to start saying things like are we all in the same at work have you know we've been here before I know we've done an intense sense of deja vu is the typical epileptic aura and sometimes a dad that can stop the whole seizure back home we've had a cancer patient five minutes oh the chemotherapy taste yeah that's been yeah and they do they just put as much food as they can in their body and within those five minutes yeah fast onset high dosage equals faster we do but we do see more cases so let's talk about what abuse people's there's a difference between dependence and addiction dependence is defined by the National Institutes for drug abuse as physical discomfort on the removal of the substance so if you're a back pain patient and you marijuana back pain okay addiction however is compulsive use of the substance in the absence of symptoms if you are dabbing ten times a day because it's time to dab again not because your back pain is back we have patients who tell us that that's what they're doing that they're just so used to dabbing at these times any use that gives you no enjoyment with the habitual use is a problem if it's interfering with your life you know if you have stopped going to poker night or whatever it is because you've got a DAB there are those times you might have a problem your chances of getting addicted to marijuana are about the same as your chances of getting addicted to coffee it's about 6 percent - but it doesn't know that's a scary number there that's six percent you're running to Starbucks but it absolutely does happen and one of the reasons I think it's crazy oh no no yeah yeah I mean you can see is more addictive than any other substance it is the hardest one to get off heroin cocaine on the alcohol I mean this is this is a pretty amazing chocolate filter so you're lucky though that's very much so again anymore so every now and then you'll have someone comes in who's one of those dab tens times a day people and they all see you know when you're out of their hairy rat dab and they'll be upset they'll start to get agitated about it neurological and psychological side effects from dads can be merry in etosha problems sleep disturbances dizziness and disorientation cognitive impairments mood swings low motivation and low sex drive but guess what those are also the same symptoms of drinking too much butane poisoning propane poisoning isopropyl it's also hydrocarbon what's called Peters syndrome which is too much exposure is sawdust these are some tabs tested in July of 2014 here we have 2700 parts per million of butane and wounded abs here's a teen over a thousand in another here's this propane Deb was not well purged has got 4,500 I was not on the committee for how much residual solvent there's going to be allowed in dabs I wanted them to follow OSHA guidance and they threw it out the window they said 800 parts per million is totally fun OSHA shows damage here it is damaging my lease at 100 parts per million to 400 parts per million we've got over 4,000 and that and our and the people who make concentrates who are on this committee one it set at 800 milligrams the 800 per clearly an end even more at is known to cause painters syndrome are they going to be required to list the ppm on them I don't know and I don't think so right at our work right now we tested only recreational as you know any not medical and we are not testing for this right now you do not know there's no reason we have good enough 13 methods there's no reason for there to be any residual saucers and it is laziness to not extract it where you still going to see activities right anyway there is such a thing as chronic solvent and bass encephalopathy caused by inhaled organic solvents it's called painters syndrome because it typically happens to people who stand furniture who are living in places that aren't well ventilated it crosses the blood-brain barrier is present and mouse studies effect on absorption heating a solvents is unwell these are people who are using it without heating that we only heating those same solvents and putting them into our face so this is why we think that maybe some of the effects from dabs are from the solvents and not necessarily from the cannabis the neuroprotective effect of cannabis seem to be strong enough that no one has ever had a recorded case of chronic solvent based encephalopathy from doing gaps we are back to on the other myth that it is a drug if you smoke it it's a medicine if you swallow it why is this an OK inhaled medicine but this is not yeah we're back to having prejudice once again as to what is a medicine and what is I am a huge fan of every way that Taylor era saw this I think that is a fantastic product it really normalizes it for a lot of people anyway this statistic I wrote this piece a couple years ago around 2017 the 2017 statistics are double this we had 64 thousand Americans died of drug overdoses in this country in 2017 there is a death you know deaths an American number that comes out from the Department of Health every year that's a fascinating read and it shows how many people die from buckets and panels for example clear dissipated let's talk about that in a minute because that's an important thing first of all fetal marijuana syndrome is not a thing it does not exist it has never been an issue fetal alcohol syndrome is a real and serious risk there's no such name as feed on marijuana syndrome here's the problem or your you know customers who may be pregnant or planning a pregnancy we always tell people do not use cannabis and your third trimester of pregnancy period do not use it near third trimester not because Ebola we tell people that absolutely there is no damage to the child but every hospital in this state diaper tests the baby and if the baby tests positive for THC you're a child abuser and social services can number one take your child away number two give you a shot to prevent lactation and all it says this has been constant and there is no proof it's not based on how people complain your houses one or two days after giving birth is what they base their judgment on whether or not you're a child you know abuser on but it's it's horrible so the reason that we say no cannabis during the third trimester is to protect the mother from social services not to protect the child from any harmful effects so cannabis is kill zero people never and that includes babies in 2014 forty five percent of the marijuana products sold in Colorado were not for smoking and this is unpopular that edibles and other forms I wanted to hundred percent my son I just there's no they might not have been doing it though they just get me every once before he turns 18 let's go on to oral absorption so tinctures so it sprays things that you hold under your tongue that's called buccal membrane absorption which means that the mucous membranes in the mouth are absorbing more of it than the stomach does it's a great way for people who are terrified to smoke it will get a lot of these people know you see them every day oh I couldn't smoke I'm afraid those smoking kills ads that we all watched when we were young people worked I mean even though no one has ever died from lung cancer from smoking marijuana you know there's there's a great stigma against inhaled products now so this is kind of a Midway product you can absorb through the mouth membrane which gives you a medium onset it takes effect in ten to 20 minutes it's typically 20 minutes to peak plasma for a little tincture held under the or an oil spray or a lollipop that you suck on before you swallow it but it's the same short duration I've only last for one to three hours typically like smoking so it's a good way for people who are afraid to try something with a little bit of a faster action without waiting a 6-day that wasn't that under open take effect so GW Pharmaceuticals the makers of sativex the one and only approved as a pharmaceutical everywhere except for the United States did a lot of work for us Thank You GW for doing true pharmacokinetic testing so this is where things get crazy they gave them all a 20 milligram dose of a 1 to 1 THC and CBD it was 10 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams of CBD they used four different methods under the tongue inside of the cheek sprayed down the back of the throat and then they have a swallow capsule to test it all it gets there is no known correlation between any given dose of marijuana and any given blood level in a person or affected a person and here we see all these people giving this stuff and some people are still at the zero line all the way across some people had nothing show in their blood no matter what form was given theirs had a lot show in their blood you just don't know until you try it so this was all based on averages and that is that average line going through the middle there of all the people that they tried Peak range buried from 7 milligrams of THC to 0 across these people so the individual results are more important than contesta on any product when someone asks you how much to take it's trial and error method for them to figure it out for themselves any kind of test data it's not going to show them anything uninvent this sort of kind of results and here's the average so edibles long onset not felt for 30 to 90 minutes you don't absorb through your stomach small intestine to get down there and what you ate your last meal and how long ago it was make a big difference for how quickly that edibles going to take effect you have to be careful with dosing much higher chance of overconsumption as you all know and highly psychoactive you know highly effective knowing is properly so let's talk about how this comes in alright so here is your dose coming in so here's the regular digestive tract right and some of it is going to be absorbed through the small intestine here and then go through the liver the liver is an amazing thing the a' liver wants to scrub away all the toxins of your body and release them out as urine some of them are going to go out automatically as feces here but what actually does get absorbed goes through the paddock portal system and then out to the rest of the body and that creates 11 hydroxy THC this is a metabolite created by cytochrome p450 in your liver smoking marijuana does not convert much of the THC to 11 hydroxy and edible though can convert up to 90% so what's so great about 11 hydroxy THC well it is more psychoactive and less predictable than THC this is why when people freak out on marijuana its most always because that 11 hydroxy is what makes you freak out so how do you know if someone's gonna freak out or not well our anecdotal evidence from Clinic for over 20,000 patients says the more clogged up your liver is the more likely you are to freak out if you are an alcoholic you're more likely to freak out on edibles seriously if you spend your whole life taking an aspirin every time you had a headache and a Tylenol every time you had a fever and a benadryl every time you had claritin all summer long if you are a Christian Scientist who never took anything I never got a flu shot you're more likely to have that it will do nothing for you right so much because your honor is freshened then it's going to rub away all those nasty kennedy no he does not convert them into eliminate drugs so know your patients you know if your patients had chemotherapy their livers your livers job is to filter out all those choice drugs affects the liver as much as alcohol does and those are the people who start them off with these slopes turn them off I mean tiny little bits the people who you know grew up on a farm and went to the doctor twice in their life because it was time for the baby to come and that's the only time they went you know they might need more yeah but you never know so we're gonna start skimming bombs and stabs like we talked about earlier with the cb2 receptors in the skin literally 50% of our patients over the age of 65 try marijuana for the first time get at least some results from topically applied cannabis that's how strong is effective will be and we many a vital role and in the other day it was so cute because arthritis is terrible and I gave him we put some of a CBD only rub on before you went in because he was a terrible pain and he came out and he's like give me that right now that worked this is the first time I felt better and beers you know and we said now you're gonna go try the one with the THC in it because you'll probably respond really well but you know it's a first thing to try for a lot of seniors who want to try and marijuana it's also what we use for our commercial driver's license people or our you know the cops who come in with whatever forty pound one belt that they've learned for you know 20 years their hips are all the dust stuff it will not show on a urine drug screen unless you put it in your other pants these people so that they're not to you the SAPS will not show on ofwhat unless it has an uptake agent it will not show on a blood test if it's applied topically but it will activate those cb2 receptors so the patient should get some relief once again and we'll get into you know it's a positive or easin great - pleasure creams and things like that in just a bit yeah you really shouldn't absorb it into your bloodstream as long as it's not here under actually for women those Bugis membranes absorb they really do so your frontal impact area exactly um the rectum doesn't absorb as well because it was designed as an output device the vagina was designed as an input device of it absorbs really well which is why those you know menstrual cramp suppositories work so well for what we do have a lot of men who do get relief from back pain and things like that with rectal suppositories but the pharmacokinetics when you take so much blood after a rectal suppository aren't that great we've had fantastic results with them for colon cancer we've had fantastic results with them for [ __ ] colon we've had 5050 results of them for prostate cancer I mean it's putting it in the right area but it doesn't necessarily cross through the wall of the colon well enough to get to the prostate and some people some people it doesn't company that does there's also it depends because radiation for prostate cancer can cause that wall to weaken and then we get better results which is not a great reason to have better results but at any rate skin bugs and stats they're a great first first thing to try like you said for older people works on the area apply you've heard of icy hot this is ice but that part transdermal patches and gels these are ones that do contain uptake agents to pull them into the bloodstream and these will show on your and drug screens in cases don't seem to respond to patches as frequently as women do you want it on the thinnest part of the skin you can I am a phlebotomist a dream my bands are just right there and I can stick it on and great people who don't have their games right in the surface it doesn't seem to be as effective and they might want to find an area where it is closer one thing about the transdermal --zz the we have a patient right now who has some type of ocular cancer and she is using she lives in Tennessee and she was just going to flying back and forth she has been using a nano CDD applied around her eye because it's only the thinnest skin on the body and is having absolutely phenomenal results so there are places where the skin is really thin where you'll get better results with patches and gels I would not recommend putting a patch by your item all right Drock cannabis juice oh how I love my cannabis juice by working on a product that hopefully will great disasters within the next few parts it is a coming in a frozen product and ice cube bags the measured dose half ounce cubes yay the person who knows the MIT for me just doesn't let me start using their kitchen wait wait wait what I have been working on product for two years all the way through the body the raw cannabis juice personally I believe the thirties either have digestive enzymes in them or something that acts as a probiotic because of the results that we get with Crohn's disease irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease we have fantastic results with this it is a non-psychoactive it will not make you higher stoned it is a potent antioxidant and it tastes like Johson pretty brass it's bought more grass yes it tastes like pineapple juice is my favorite because the fibers in the pineapple do seem to soak up the fibers it's pretty fibrous too and it just it works great so random what people so this is a nutritional supplement so you use this in addition to not instead of your gummy bears inhaled medicines balms and salves and most people need more than one form of cannabis for relief anyway and combining is a wonderful way to go everybody has in front of you their new patient success bag which is for you to take home and it talks about this we have the new version coming out soon that actually has a word search where now this talks about combining the different forms of marijuana and it goes through the different things that we've talked about here just with a little bit less science but for your patients and for people you are pumping if they can break down what they're using start with small amounts them the combination that works well for them raw cannabis juice as a supplement is a preventative and that's what we're getting into next is the types of medicine yes now you're freezing that because is it true that raw cannabis these lose their potential this little value within 30 minutes I am freezing this to meet FDA regulations so that I don't have to heat it to pasteurize it do you know so is it true that if you don't think it presciently that's I disagree it most okay so when you drink any kind of Rogers raw spinach juice celery juice I have not I have tested it frozen when I tested a so first of all I had any rain I tried to juice within four hours of being cut because as with any we have changed the nutritional quality of our food by the length of time we keep it in the grocery store right now it used to be that you know your food was old if your grandmother dropped the carrot walking in from the garden to the house we don't you don't even feel like that anymore we store it for you know days weeks months before it gets to King Soopers that's where we're getting it from you know you don't know how long it's get out there when it's in City Market so I don't think that we're losing as much as we lose anyway with produce from the grocery store but I'm freezing it to meet that FDA's I don't want to have to eat and you said I'm sorry use it at the myth that you were working with is what I am working with a myth in Denver on this and we've got the product already you will be on my list first thing don't worry so why do we think we have some results you can address any of any green juice contains more of them chlorophyll is the stuff that makes plants green and how they can put sunlight into food it's amazing what chlorophyll which is plant blood is structurally similar similar to hemoglobin which is people blood they're very very similar and this is our patient our Neutral patient died and Ike who is very vocal about her cannabis use and how well it's worked for her has a rare blood disease called cryoglobulinemia she credits this was saving her money she believes it's building one for love well enough that she is able to function she's out of her wheelchair she probably shouldn't even be considered homebound anymore she's doing so well it is absolutely amazing so any time this is why I am such a big fan as a nutritional concerns of green leafy vegetables because they aren't blend builders and they help increase your energy because of that very energizing effect of any raw juice caused by that structural similarity back to your other pants suppositories and intimate oils you they have lower blood absorption so less psychoactive when use rectal eat when use naturally though I think those furia ones at 60 milligrams are too strong okay that's good to know because let me tell you my but that's good to know so I think if they cut it in half I mean that's because they are expensive and if they don't leave that much as they can have tour days where you've got it I go with whatever they're normal edible doses it seems to have a similar absorption to all right here's the recap this is in your book if you use directly although you can well sometimes it depends on what their absorption is from how they built the wall on the rectum is because it's different under four people but direct absorption because of Tory's the suppositories are less psychoactive absolutely and we do use those to increase dosage on cancer patients we just because there's less psychoactive it right because it cannot okay so pulling in the bloodstream through the liver so it's not very tight on the right track CT yeah so this is just a little chart it is in the booklet and the idea is you want your patient in control of their psycho activity and how do they do that and you start them off some all abouts they can mix and match and they can plan how long they're gonna be high it has that much effect if it just here's a chart so what's the difference between science I'm just taking notes Lewis says he didn't have to say this we can't talk about it anymore I will take that off is actually from Parks and Rec size fits all there is a size for everyone so there are different types of medicine you're going to talk to your husband raise a belt prophylactic these are the preventive and ideas of the preventive are those micro doses this subclinical dose one to five milligrams a little bit every day it might be half a joint at night for one person the next person might use a couple of drops of a tincture during the day another person might use them a couple of times or oral spray it's different for everyone what that dose looks like some people will use the wrong cannabis juice for that or th CA and others and edible every night that goes all the way through the body is what works for them and then we have daily support and once again something less psychoactive usually bombs ourselves you just topically are fantastic for a lot of people with musculoskeletal pain during the day so they'll have their whatever their thing is if it's a 20 milligram edible at night and then during the day they was the bombing South and that's a good route that's fine less psychoactive or non psychoactive a micro dosing once again especially for those pain patients a cuter episodic relief fastest way to get this into your body is to me I'm a big fan of ordinary Pottsville it's so easy to control the dose you feel like you've had too much the bomb down and almost blades freeze for that melt absorption and combining some of your gels because that works pretty fast and for severe episodes dabs and then relaxation by the stress relief is important this is where we have bath salts which as you know are epsom salts rubbed with cannabis oils they're not if anyone ever tells you to snort a bath salt well that's the spice or k2 thing that synthetic cannabinoids that kill you exactly teaser drinks in health cannabis bath soaps balms and salves and having Brad Pitt on your sofa yeah let's look at a few examples for some just patients with who we know have common conditions so here's our instance patients I know I know I've heard he does but I would love it tried to get a hold of his foundation to find out and see if he wanted to speak or make a statement for a conference and just haven't gotten any response at all anyway but he have had great results of Parkinson's patients with high doses of CBD throughout the day and then I am a firm believer of combining CBD and THC and smoking as needed we want to relieve spasticity you you want to relieve tremors and you want to relieve pain the bath soaps for people like that it's so much for someone with tremors and also spasms like that you know Tony Hawk when he's you know recovering from his shattered pelvis back in rehab every other month right musculoskeletal pain we would want him probably a high dose animal every night make him get some sleep what happens with musculoskeletal pain is who tend to wake up every hour and a half because everybody unconsciously rules over in their sleep and when you when you roll over unconsciously all of that starts complaining you're back up again and this is where edibles should shine all the way through the body can help you stay asleep and that good night's sleep really results in a better day the next day we would micro dose of THC throughout the day put bombs and satyrs on it baby wait Tony it's again no famous epileptic well and he's obviously got ear pain here in this photo too but for seizures sometimes the CBN patch can actually help but in most cases there's sweet spots with the CBD THC ratios for our seizure patients we find that the 10 to 110 part CBD one part THC is a sweet spot but we also have people who have to flip that and do it the opposite because they were together it is it was true trial and error for that one um and then we here we have Messiah doctor for all of you people who remember poke you on this little duck whose secret power was my green so we want some CBD THC breadcrumbs we might want high THC they like Durbin poison one of the reasons for that is migraine headaches there's a couple different types and one of them is where your blood vessels feels all squeezed together and super tight th CV can actually act as a fizzle dilator so migraine patients who do well on imitrex we have them try a high THC v strain and Durbin poison is the most common one on that and any variation on that days you know whatever growing because we tend to get good results with those vasodilators the other type of migraine is the one that is the opposite where your head feels flooded with blood and caffeine and other vasoconstrictors look better and that's just whatever strain whatever the day so mister I don't know which which are basal constrictors me know the THC v does act as a vasodilator which can also help for asthmatics there is a key in the back the sciences of the back and th c d it does not explain what the key is I'm sorry I don't know the actual scientific word for THC tetrahydrocannabinol but it does have an enderman poisonous durbin poisonous the wine that has is ready to make those a nineteen-year only like you wouldn't have to look at test results a lot of in America that's where that I found the highest it's like 18 milligrams understand well it's supposedly anti-obesity so there's a chick that comes in and I we're reading stuff and I was really it's on that page we add up so she was like anti bees or Hebrews did you find the thing with the most of that in th TV and that's back to the where things get weird again if it's a tomato that's never been hybridized it's called an heirloom if it is a cannabis strain that's never been hybridized it's called the land race [Music] right so these are examples of providing different medicines for a patient and figuring out what's right for them starting doses if the patient is starting on CBD alone they tend to start with a milligram per 10 pounds of body weight because you've got to start somewhere if the patient is lethargic grumpy or has a flat emotional effect add instant THC and drop the CBD on the opposite side of that we typically start you know anywhere from 2 to 5 milligrams for patients with THC they're anxious or uncomfortable and they will know what uncomfortable means you reduce the THC and add in some CBD with with the CBD you know the grumpy the meanest and lethargy falling asleep sometimes are really the only side effects we see there is something called a paradoxical effect paradoxical effect is when you have the opposite reaction to what is expected it's the people who fall asleep that when they drink coffee for example the paradoxical effect happens one in six people about 15% of the time with all learning drugs as medicines one in six okay so one in six people are going to get wired from CBT that's good there we go there's always what 20% of our medical patients yeah exactly fifteen is the actual but think they are flip it's called a paradoxical reaction it is a real thing and it sometimes people can over time get better with it for example let's say you're super low on magnesium all right as a nutritional consulting you take magnesium the first couple of times you take it you're going to go throw up because your body is not going to know how to handle it and what we find is some of these paradoxical reactions is that endocannabinoid system seems to be depressed and we have to find the pump a little bit it can be one to two weeks there's people who feel nothing from any type of cannabis for the first couple of weeks that they take it and then all of a sudden it kicks in and we think it's because they're endocrine and immune system is so depressed they haven't made any endogenous cannabinoids for so long that it takes a while to get it moving again and then once it starts if you ever heard of anyone actually having like symptoms with just pain in general but when they actually consume it makes it worse yes that there is and that's that focus the feeling effect that Michael Pollan was talking about when he was born hunting some people feel that it focuses that pain and increases its intense becomes all they can concentrate on that it makes it and there are also people ironically who are allergic to those two I can't drink a beer without getting a rash from the neck down because I'm allergic to hops - you know anything in that plant family certain aids are all it's all or none it doesn't matter how its processed I have to take it with benadryl when I take it no better water yeah are you saying that's all marijuana okay so I was wrong I do believe she is she has a Chiari malformation oh but she believed she is allergic to it so she could take it with benadryl yeah she might be able to take it with benadryl might be able to yeah but that Chiari malformation that's we've had good results of it that's right but it's yeah it's pretty devastating yeah birth defect yeah yeah so anyway so this is generally very smart people even if whatever Sunita strand makes you miss it - I can notice its heba's in a bacon occasionally I've learned not to hide much but because I'm so sensitive to moles it's just part of my life my migraines yeah yeah yeah I was taking it up someone's fun girl get on the floor vomiting in ten minutes that is unfortunately for me until this is something that makes you significantly less hi so starting to insist for everyone is here and then what to do if you get to pride is here I believe a formula called Mary's rescue a few years ago they use what Cyril Philosopher's calling to activate the reduce dopamine levels in the brain and then that was going to push it up your feces which is home twenty five percenters to literacy is expressed it worked in about an hour this works in about 10 to 15 minutes it works so fast it works so well it is made from something called olive tall olive tells a chemical that has been studied in regards to THC for decades my friend tsurara found a plant-based source of it in the lake and restore a myriad of rocks and habitant the use of ala tall she's you know put this in with vitamin E and some olive oil and things like that to to standardize the dosage and she has a patent on it for reducing overconsumption symptoms with cannabis and the stuff totally works I have used it myself have you make it yes you can have these in the dispensary this is like having a lighter in the dispensary because it contains no cannabis this is an accessory that goes near the t-shirts can we soundbar we give enough you can sell these through your samples it cost the wholesale process five bucks they sell for ten dollars it's two doses for most normal overconsumption situations like you've been doing go to work she was unable to stand she's running we asked her she wanted to take an undo she said yes I gave her one I mean she's unable to stand at this point the massage therapists are just kind of patting her head she stood up in 20 minutes we literally just got up stood up and said I'm gonna be okay now and everyone's like oh oh my gosh it works that are coming in and you always can tell who they are and then the older some of those older medical patients yes have that cancer and are so nervous like we've talked to over medical to be able to give them this with you know that color out of Canada Spears or something you know thanks and then they will feel like it's number than alcohol but nothing happened you know sometimes it was together so this is your sampling give it ease dry not you know try it on family members things like that very good we're all so this is like an aspirin bottle that says take one 251 to 10 times per day the motive this is Oh cannabis is like an astronaut says take one 250 ok 1 to 10 times per day you don't know if your patients a 1 22 17 to 35 they could be a 50 all of that is appropriate use because no one has ever died of a marijuana overdose Enoch and I were talking earlier about 18 to 20 year olds who give their medical cards and come in and what are the ethics on that if the person you know what are the ethics on people who get the medical cards and just want to get high and the way that I look at it is that someone who is out there chasing that high it's going to get high anyway and this is so much safer than alcohol there's so much safer than pills that as far as I'm concerned this is more ethical than turning them away and having them go to a liquor store because they can die so that's my personal opinion on it I mean everyone's got to make their own decision on that but we had a 17 year old kid died in Grand Junction last summer glass gym keep them brought in by his parents three weeks before his 18th birthday you know already hooked on painkillers after shoulder surgery resulting from a football injury and he was worried about himself the parents were worried about him always like he was going to expire on three weeks and I made the call say well we'll just wait two weeks two million it started that way to get your new ID two weeks after the date we should have heard from him we call his parents and they were burying him he OD on the painkillers he never got started I have just ever since then it's been like you know so someone wants to get my big deal there that's why you know we didn't have this conversation that's where I'm headed I don't care they're gonna get hyeondo so anyway interactions and questions are in the back of the book for you in general you know it is already tourists and affects people more profoundly and altitude than it does in the lowlands I may be too careful people with high blood pressure if you have high blood pressure use your cannabis at a different time of day than you take your high blood pressure medicine because we talked about smoking marijuana lowers your blood pressure and if you're already on a blood pressure lowering medicine once again you can fix it separate I know marijuana overdose diabetics take your blood sugar more frequently until you figure out how it affects you to avoid a crash do not stop your narcotics cold turkey do not stop your seizure meds cold turkey those are just common sense of sort of things and then write down what you try and last but not least we are used to drug taking as a lifestyle here in the States we are used to seeing commercials with people skipping happily across fields of Flanders entering because the fouls are no loose from whatever drugs they're taking yeah so you're not depressed the shadows on the stars living don't let your plaque psoriasis keep you from living life you never wanna can help it is obviously a field of flowers no side effects and how is the flower different than all the drugs that C we see advertised exactly it's not it's not an drug taking as a lifestyle is being promoted they just won't study", "viQJRdA7oqA": "it's complicated holy crap weed is complicated you have to know a tiny little bit about where I'm coming from on this because I think that the old saying where you stand on an issue often depends on where you sit at night is very applicable here so just just a tiny little bit about me and then we are going to do we're at 7:20 what time we start 7:15 yeah anyway we're gonna drink from a fire hose in a second let's and I am raising three kids in the weed capital of the world and that 7:30 great and and that influences and affects the way that I see things it does a couple of years ago maybe a year and a half ago I was at a cannabis summit in Northern California and I said I was from the weed capital of America and a guy who owned a big grow operation in the back said yeah give us a minute and so can maybe maybe Humboldt will catch up again to Colorado but for now yeah we kind of got you guys beat we went first and so we have a pretty unique perspective on this and I've been trying to pay really close attention something else that I know impacts us is my own recovery I got sober not not too far from here actually in June 15th of 1996 and by the grace of God haven't found it necessary to put anything into my body that changes my mood since then and what I found in working with young folks in recovery is this really has changed the conversation you know we got this secret society right and we like we help each other out sponsor people who do that kind of thing and there's always been this idea of marijuana maintenance you know like that no get sober from that but I'm not really gonna get sober from all of that what we come to learn a little bit maybe later on in our recovery is it's not so much about cutting one particular thing out of our life is it is what what have we been avoiding the conversation about and what we have we've been avoiding actually sitting down and getting into and this has made it a little more difficult for me with some of those guys because it's so prolific and there's such an accepted idea out there but like there's this it's just weed thing and another little crusade against that lately because I've seen people getting heat being like not as good an addict when they go into treatment for this and people vote it's just weed well you've met eleven out of the eleven diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder I'd say you got this thing pretty good but it's changed the way we work in in the beginning of things that was just a non-profit I was involved in for a long time and that's reversed 2012 to 2017 2007 to 2012 and I was at the University Colorado Hospital for five years when we went recreational so I was inside of the chemical dependency treatment program there when Colorado voted and then when we actually opened up retail stores so kind of had a front row seat at a big safety net facility in urban Denver which was a really neat perspective during that time I wrote a book and I wrote that book with apps like no small amount of assistance from dad he reviewed every chapter he's broke to master's degrees and and covered everything basically when I didn't even couldn't spell something close enough for spellcheck to get it dad dad would figure it out for me it's a maybe you should say the sentence this way so you don't sound like a you know ten year old I wrote a book and then I gave a TED talk in 2017 last year about this that's now a million and a half people have seen it and so that one's getting kind of cool I spend all my time consulting since I left the hospital inside of treatment for labor I work for a big labor union helping them vet appropriate treatment programs but the majority of my temps time is spent in athletic circles so professional and collegiate athletics both helping them develop policies that are a little bit more geared towards helping people who have substance use disorder mental health issues a little less punitive maybe but also performance issues around this drug in and other drugs and then a couple of states I spend time working with a couple of states and now helping Canada to hopefully do this smarter than Colorado did listen it's complicated so let's start the conversation about it being complicated with with this slide I sit on the board of directors for something called Sam smart approaches to marijuana and when Sam started in 2017 it had nothing to do with being the anti group Sam is totally the anti group now they're the ones who fund the no campaigns they're the ones who are on the ground saying no but when Sam started it wasn't about that when Kevin Sabet and Patrick Kennedy called and said this is what we're thinking about doing I loved it because I loved these four pillars that they stood for so listen I'm not the politicking guy there's plenty of politicking guys who were involved in Sam and they're doing great work I'm happy for him but I still sit on the board because I believe in these things and these things start to illustrate how complicated it is so let's run through them real quickly Sam exists to inform public policy with the science of today's marijuana if we were talking about marijuana from years past for as lovely as it is to be in eastern Pennsylvania in the middle of a blizzard I wouldn't be here right now I would be back home with my family I don't have an interest in having a conversation about pardon me the historical makeup of the plant function of the plant the ridiculousness of a lot of the laws that governed the way that we interact with this plant from back in the 30s I don't have an interest in talking about marijuana and from years past because that's irrelevant in my mind to today's conversation understanding the science of today's marijuana is something all buddy people miss it even when I sit down with clinicians who are on the front line in Colorado a lot of them have missed it because it's one that's changing so rapidly and then two there's so much hype around it that unless you've figured out a way to cut through the nonsense and to try and be it is truly objective as you can is learning about it's very difficult conversation to get Sam also exists to discuss reducing unintended consequences of marijuana policy there's just some really terrible policy out there people who get in trouble for something silly that they did and then it dramatically affects their lives negatively for the rest of their life I'm not for that and as a matter of fact a lot of the work that I do inside of the athletic world hopefully is reducing that there's still some places who need to get a little bit more hip to the time so I don't like taxes and stuff Sam exists to prevent the establishment of big marijuana so like we didn't do it we need to change that from from prevent the establishment have to hold the feet to the fire of fairly conservatively we taxed the sale in North America we tax the sale of about nine point eight billion dollars worth of weed last year and 2017 will break twelve billion this year in all likelihood like this a lot a lot a lot of weed okay it's it's almost three times what we taxed in the sale of milk wheat right three point eight we are consuming a ton of weed in this country and if we miss the economic drivers behind it I think we missed some of the crucial part of this conversation if we think and may and I'm sure it still exists in lots of places around the country in Pennsylvania because you the the industry here is so young and it's in its fledgling stages but for us in Colorado this idea of somebody being like all sharks I just own that little dispensary out there on the you know tegrity farms they think wait watch the south art there they're really good integrity farms thing going it's ridiculous doesn't exist anymore you've had the the Monsanto's and the Walmart's come in and take over the cute little mom-and-pop and the people who really cared about this thing and we're a part of their communities come on man that's what we do in this country big money takes over passion all the time and and that is what has happened and so if we are willing to have a little bit more honest look at that part of it I think we could have a much better conversation about this thing because to think that big marijuana is not a thing is to allow a profiteering industry to have free rein and to not have the same kind of checks and balances that we hold over everything else Sam also exists to promote research on medical marijuana and to produce pharmacy attainable medications thank God the feds finally got out of the way and let ever dialects give it FDA approval and now we've got that that we have now three medications that are cannabis base that are good there's you ready for this like you you Hawks who came in here ready for somebody to bash marijuana until the Sun came up and the give me some bad news like there's medicine in the plant like like period we know for sure for sure there's an anticonvulsant is anti-inflammatory topical anti-inflammatories a whole lot better than ingested because ibuprofen looks better than that there's there's some really amazing stuff for people with MS particularly late stage MS and relaxing muscles and ticks and a couple other things are promising there is medicine inside of this plant and we would have been a whole lot better off from the beginning to have admitted that and had honest conversations about it now with that said you don't smoke medicine ever period stop end of story like never ever ever in the history of ever has it been like you know we should do we should dry that [ __ ] out light that [ __ ] up and inhale that [ __ ] that's the best way to get it into our bodies no no no that's not what you do you isolate the components of particularly pharmacy attainable pieces and you do it in a regulated manner not somebody telling you this one fixes that this one fixes that this is good for that you have to be very very careful with medicine by popular vote so we know that there's medicine here but we also know that there's a whole lot of hyperbole here and a whole lot of profiteering here and we need to be careful with what we call medicine so look there's a little bit of the it's complicated part this is this part is not complicated the true scientific stuff that we're going to say tonight is not complicated real science is you're ready for this it's simple you'll win this on Jeopardy if you ever get asked the question this is real science is journal published peer-reviewed the thing that your nephew read on HuffPost or that like came up from BuzzFeed or the like no no in surveys aren't science and polls aren't science and something that somebody says they they did a big long scientific study on but hasn't been reviewed by peers or published in a journal doesn't count so every single thing inside of this tonight is journal published and peer review there's a full list of citations at the end appropriate for continuing medical education and Kim will make sure anybody wants it I draw heavily on these we have some wonderful demographic data that's come from the Colorado Health Institute lately I'm gonna have to start to fly a little bit to get through this so excuse me for skipping through some of these things got to do something we have to start this I have to figure out a new way to start this thing because I asked everybody to do something that's almost impossible at the beginning I'm gonna ask you to do something that is nearly impossible I'm gonna ask you to step away from what your construct of marijuana is so if I feel free to play along if you want if you don't find it but when I close my eyes and if somebody says weed the thing that I think of first off was the cover of that Dre album from when he was still a rapper the chronic I'm pretty sure you threw it out when you heard me listening I knew you through the cherry pie single out with - I see the cypress hill shirt that I owned they said legalize it on the bottom with the leaf on the front of it I see a green leafy plant I see Cheech and Chong after the whole false advertising thing with a joint this big as fast times at ridgemont high and that's not just that one seen the whole thing I see fast times and I see dazed and confused and I see Friday I see a plant and and what we're talking about today man if you I hope you can read this and said this is the new school cannabis it's not what you've smoked in the 70s let me say something crazy and something that actually frustrates people sometime and then give me the next ten minutes to prove it to you here's a there's a big blanket statement and you got to give me a couple minutes to prove it unless you have purchased and consumed a commercial product THC product in last three years or so you don't know what you're talking about you are operating under a construct of what this is that is so antiquated that it is irrelevant and for us to believe that we know what we're talking about because we you know listen to Joe Walsh and got a little bit high or Cypress Hill or dr. Dre or that and we haven't consumed something that's come about in the last three years what we're doing a disservice to the people who were trying to have that conversation with I believe because we're not talking about the cannabis of the 70s we're talking about THC so there's two hundred some chemicals inside of the plant before you light it on fire five hundred and seven after you light on fire there's two of them that really really really really really matter CBD why are we so concerned with CBD anybody medicinal it's where the medicine is it's elated and and synthesized oh boy especially synthesized like it's where the medicine is that's something else kind of cool we'll talk about in a minute well and how about tea tea why are we concerned with that it is the like capital letters underlined psychoactive component inside of cannabis THC is the part of the plant that is the drug all right eh sees what gets you high you got a plant with a drug inside of it and that's the drunk and and and I love the honesty of this particular dispensary they chased me out of the parking lot is always taking the picture because it's not like nature's healing whatever there's just like look we sell THC it's what we do what do you want we got it we got it what you want THC we got th so you remember that movie thank you for smoking there's a point in it where the protagonist having a conversation with an executive from a cigarette company and and the executive says man we don't sell cigarettes we sell nicotine delivery systems shift shift shift I'm not talking about a plant I'm talking about THC and THC delivery systems in fact I think it's incredibly important that we begin to change our vernacular around it a little bit you'll see me move away from saying things like cannabis now unless I'm actually talking about the plan and I'll be referring to it to the market as THC for the rest of time because we did what we did in Colorado was built a dedicated THC market there's absolutely CBD available and absolutely lower percentages but there ain't a ton of money in it it's like people last wells tumble can't you get CBD well of course you can get CBD there's real medicine there and there but um like you can totally buy decaf at Starbucks I don't know the last time I did it but like sure it's out there but the market is for the THC so understand this we're gonna go a tiny bit 201 for you guys tonight because you were so gracious to come out again here's th see here's CBD this is the kind of data set we dream about beautiful perfect perfect data set same place same people same everything 1960 2011 this teaches us several things the first thing that it teaches us is that the understanding that we have of what the historical plant cannabis hemp etc with the our understanding of that plan historically was spot-on as we started to measure it and that is that you ready oh so if one at one or two of us have heard that marijuana is natural right what is natural what what naturally occurs inside of this plane as less than a half of a percent of THC very 0.2 to 0.5 unless you were like Indonesia or somewhere subtropical or they had like some ball or but you know 150 years ago maybe you get 2% you had some for real stuff which maybe maybe that and what we see is we start to measure 1960s we're barely touching this is done in the uniform way we're barely touching it and finally in the 80s these guys started to listen to the to the people at normal who were screaming at him outside of the door saying it's there's medicine as medicine and I actually started to test for CBD so what we see here over the course of these 50 years is we go from the the naturally-occurring amount of THC inside of this product to where we were in 2011 when the federal government shut this whole program down but the important thing we see and this is what most people miss and this is what you guys will know now you can come back to a great retort to most arguments that it's not so much about the THC so we actually get really bent out of shape about high THC products it's not so much about how high the THC is as it is about the Delta between the two because what naturally occurs inside of cannabis is not just that less than half of a percent THC it is a one to one ratio of THC to CBD it's god's little gift this is cool this is something that makes me like get excited about and super respectful of this plant especially historical context of this place when the 50 cent to learn decided traditional Chinese medicine we just found it more tombs in Asia we found it in tombs in Africa like mankind is interacted with cannabis forever and in the plant that God gave us is a one-to-one ratio of THC the CBD and the reason why that matters is a CBD neutralizes the psychoactive component that is tac at a one-to-one ratio you can I get high I don't care if you got 10% and 10% you'll feel a little weird from smoke inhalation right interesting cool but what do we do man we can't enough we can't mess up and in this country there's there's nothing that we won't figure out a way to screw up we got more THC kept the CBD about the same why why did we increase the THC yeah because we wanted to get hot like if you guys oh when you graduated college to habit if y'all would have chilled out a little bit back then maybe we wouldn't have gone to hydroponic inverted hydroponic cloning and a sexualized plan indoor grows super accelerated growth patterns and then the real thing was as we were just kind of mixing strains together to make them stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger we over the course of 50 years later we'd stronger check this out fifty years increments of two and a half fifty years two and a half six years increments of five in my home state let's put it together blue is Colorado Green is when we stop measuring nationally this is what most people know and want to talk about you think you know weed unless you have purchased and consumed the products that were sold commercially in the last three or so years your construct of cannabis is so antiquated that it is irrelevant simple because this was not doing the same stuff that this is what we see associated with this is things that you would never have imagined here yet the historic arguments persist what we want to do is talk about this substance and sell and consume that substance is not fair it's not appropriate the it listen I'm a I'm a grown-up there's a lot of grown-ups out that you can do whatever you're gonna do don't drive that's my thing if you got a fully myelinated frontal lobe don't drive I'm not gonna tell anybody how to live I'm certainly not gonna throw my agenda on everybody else's life but I will tell you that if we're making decisions on what you think this drug is from interaction back here this plant was back here about this you are not operating with a full amount of information and I see as my job to make sure people got a full amount information okay okay okay we've gone from good gardening to good chemistry good God like we got to be careful here one of the first questions that I get asked when a traveler doing anything spend you really believe that marijuana is addictive if there's absolutely like it's not a belief system I like to answer by saying I believe marijuana is addictive in the same way that I believe Wyoming lies directly north of Colorado believe that I use like anybody else in this world who's paying attention to it okay watch this what watch those of you who also prevention or treatment in here couple of you watch how far we have come in this country you guys just fill in the blank throw the word out say whatever comes to mind at the end of this addiction is a disease you cannot diagnose a disease by walking around and seeing what's on somebody's playlist what their ethnicity is what car they drove up in what kind of shirt they're wearing how many times they've watched Friday the only way you can do it is with objective diagnostic criteria there are 11 set forth in the DSM if one meets two or three you have a substance use disorder that's classified as mild four or five moderate six or more severe using those criteria given 2002 data roughly 9% of all adults adult being someone with a myelinated frontal lobe of fully developed frontal lobe which is mid-20s 26 for guys 23 or so for women someone with a fully myelinated frontal lobe of a 9% of you will become addicted to cannabis if you're exposed to it the reason why that doesn't matter even a little bit is because that's the portion of the population that's genetically predisposed to any way that if all of us woke up tomorrow on a desert island 10% of you would be doing really weird stuff with like coconut leaves and stuff with me in the corner of the island because right because we needed that dopamine spike now it gets interesting when you look at a pre myelinated brain adolescent which again under mid-2017 percent and it gets really interesting when you look at data from 2011 a variation of a hundred percent let's dissect it just a little bit if I can tell the entire world one thing it would be this that's what we were talking about a little bit yesterday that the DSM the manual that we use to give the the diagnostic information for all mental health disorders for the first time ever a year and a half ago included a diagnostic criterion for cannabis withdraw post acute withdrawal syndrome pause with accompanying icd-9 codes from cannabis physical dependence on THC sooo back here nope not so much remember hits you can get a psychological dependence you can do it yep back here true here completely and totally different and absolutely we I was part of the very first wave that watched all of this happened real-time you go from seeing this never to seeing this six seven eight hundred times a month things have changed we've dramatically changed because it's a different substance so let's talk about the why here's my home that's Starbucks that's McDonald's that's wheat you know laugh it up Pennsylvania see well you're freakin governor does here 1014 AD 376 from 2017 bring us about here because in 2017 we added 376 let's do a little econ simple simple simple self how can Colorado support this amount of retail it's very easy there is a consumer base it's very very easy we can support that growth in that amount of retail because there's a consumer growth how does that growth continue at that rate again SuperDuper simple you in crease the consumer base two ways to do it convert curry users to more frequent users capture new users no other way we have to ask ourself why does the old 80/20 rule matter in this situation the 80/20 rule that says that 80% of the booze in this country is consumed by roughly 20% of the consumers that the alcohol industry could care about my wife and her four or five margaritas a year he's the guy was drinking mad dog 20/20 at 12 years old who they really liked sorry about that again I put these people through a rough time in Colorado 84% of the THC has been consumed by 20% of the consumers who are those people no disproportionately young under 26 problem users they are problem users like anything this industry is gonna build what they got on the backs of the least fortunate those of us with a substance use disorder those of us with mental health disorders those of us who are more challenged those of us who are economically disenfranchised they will be the 20% consuming eighty four percent in Colorado you are twice as likely to consume marijuana daily if you earn under $25,000 a year than if you earn over 50 the problem users let us build the problem users I'm gonna teach you something new right now III hope those of you in prevention and treatment you already know this you want to build a problem user for THC there's three factors there's really four but we have no control over genetic susceptibility and genetic predisposition the three age of onset frequency of use and THC potency if we're growing at this rate and if we gotta build these people there's a quick tour of Colorado age of onset that's Cookie Monster on the side of a dispensary with a plate full of dope they got a cease and desist from Sesame Street that's Keef cat and Buddha finger chrome crunch these guys got these guys got a lawsuit from Hershey's this is the the open house dates that my kids brought home my daughter when she went from eighth grade to ninth grade last year my son went from sixth grade to seventh grade so they each got these in school is the boulder daily camera it's not some fringe weirdo newspaper and it's got all the open houses and like the whole a client's middle school they have a better marching cheer whatever so they went to to pick which ones they work as they were given these in school my daughter comes up 15 minutes later she goes dad check it out there's a half page full-color ad for a dispensary and page one of that called star buds and she goes first I thought it was for Starbucks but then I realize it was for weed I thought somebody ought to give that marketing guy of bonus because he did it he got that message in front of every single kid in my County and he branded it to something that they know and love anyway age of onset I'm gonna have to be a little judicious with time here age of onset poohbear davon doesn't turn me on any of you relatively responsible adults out there have you downloaded the cush moji from the iTunes Store yet that made 20% off move in special at cu-boulder who moves in May and freshmen sophomore I'm like 21 year old freshman sophomore though are there out there Spring Break 20% off with your student ID Santa Claus with a bag full of dope a back-to-school special with a half-naked chick hair there's 20% off with your student ID there's Fred Flintstone smoking a dab between two half-naked chicks frequency of use smoke weed everyday' listen man I don't care how developed your frontal lobe is don't smoke weed everyday' this leaves the physical like changes in the physical structure of your brain lots of gray matter white matter connective tissue and we're actually starting to see a lot more long-term residual stuff too don't don't don't fun to have fun but really the same thing like if somebody was getting drunk daily you really okay don't smoke weed every day unless you're these guys going twenty dispensaries then it makes sense so weekend don't forget to dabble daily I teach you about dabs in just a second we make it easier for you consumable pre-roll oh shoot will make a gas station where you can pull up get your gas pump for you and get somebody to bring your dope oh that came in the value pack to my house it's $1,000 pound who needs a pound of this weed to consume dollar joint when I show you my ski pass or bring in your ski pass and get it for eight here can I translate elevate your adventure and go as high as you can can I translate that's where you get really really high go skiing frequent frequent frequent all the time I got a buddy in Wyoming who's 13 year old daughter and wife were struck by a snowboard impaired th-the impaired snowboarder only THC his wife was in the ICU for like two months and his daughter died like skiing stone ain't funny man but look haha potency bud tenders are trained to have their most potent products that they're ready when ask for a suggestion why age of onset frequency of use and potency and here's the messaging at home that I have to contend with is I'm talking to young people and say okay listen maybe this for older folks as I've moved into more of a harm reduction mode medicine for you maybe need to be more careful whatever old man teddy bear riding the roster rock it over the flat iron to stay high Boulder it's difficult to to I want to teach you guys like like two things quick in the next 10 minutes before our questions and I'm not going to have time to get to the mental health issues what we're seeing but before I go into these two because I'm gonna go SuperDuper quick through what you're gonna 10 10 or 15 years from now we we are going to be having a conversation in which the next generation is going to say can you believe there was a time when they didn't see a link between psychosis other mental health issues in THC in the same way that my generation says to you guys sorry I keep hitting the thing in the same way my generation is like I can't believe there was a time when you guys didn't know the link between tobacco cancer unbelievable the that's a foot race between the knowledge in the industry but what's happening with it from the mental health side listen man had a two three four percent counterbalance with some THC in it we didn't have these problems that movie reefer madness was insane they made it because the government wanted to do bad things to black Hispanic and Asian people the movie was nuts today though we see true psychosis associated with this for real but the problem is cuz people freaked out before when they didn't have any business doing that now nobody's taking it as seriously as they should outside of the medical world but my dance card is full I could do three of these a week if I felt like being away from home that much and the majority of them are for physicians holy crap what do we do with all this that we're seeing how do we handle this we're talking about concentrates and edibles real quick sixteen percent in our discussion of concentrates we begin with this number because sixteen percent is the highest potency cannabis we have ever studied Lancet journal February 2015 volume 2 number three the effects of high potency cannabis on psychosis there's a new study that will get the first report from Hoffner at all looking at roughly eighty percent at a uch this year but until then mankind humankind's collective knowledge of high potency cannabis ends here 16% so when we talk about the issues associated with high potency that's what we're using as the benchmark with this number what Lancet taught us was the daily use which is five times a week it saw an increase in psychosis fivefold multiplier five weekend use which is twice a week so increase threefold and one quarter of all the psychosis in the sample group was causal like isolated for sure causally there's a whole question causation correlation you know did this start the fire was it just gas on the fire it's a really good question with marijuana because a lot of the times there's pre-existing conditions and who knows what's going on it could be a million different things but what we're starting to find said there's actual causal with this high-potency stuff so concentrate concentrate concentrate what it would what you're gonna see who's familiar what you see sometimes I think is like it's so intense for some people that they're like oh that can't be a thing so we like we rationalize we find a way to explain it we said that's not really what people are consuming in 2014 the word concentrate shows up nowhere in the annual economic report about weed in Colorado even though we were selling it 2015 once when we say there's contaminants same thing in 2016 2017 s report they say oh we taxed the sale above ground so we tax the sale of twenty seven thousand eight hundred and ninety pounds of concentrates in Colorado four point five million doses if you can't read this it's the concentrate education campaign but its dispensary says cannabis concentrates are potent start by consuming a small dose about half the size of a pinhead or less we're still twenty eight thousand pounds of that last year taxed the sale the twenty eight thousand pounds so it's probably forty percent of what we actually didn't say this is not friend use I've been on the front lines of this since 2007 in Colorado I've been in and like the formal hospital side front lines of this since before and through this is not what people are graduating to this is what they are initiating on and the idea that well they'll just consume less that's does not how tolerance for THC works you go over throw this in YouTube you know you watch people consuming five six seven eight nine grams there's a 10 gram challenge with a bunch of so that this is not friend use Colorado last year and 2017 sold more of this by dollar amount than the plant sink in for a minute in Colorado we sold more of this which I'm about to show you what it is then the plant not talking foreign juice mainstream market so here's what it is this is great crack is back crack is wack crack he'll say no to crack sound familiar well kids I'm here to tell you that not all crack is bad some crack is actually really really good we're talking about crack weed so we call it for 99.99% age where does our collective knowledge end yes the rest is anecdotal you consume these things in a vaporizer with a ceramic tip because 700 degrees or so is ideal for the rock form of them you consume it with a aromatherapy kit that you plug into the wall because it gets the high cuz it's hot quicker you consume it on a glass pipe because it's rock form you consume it in these little pocket email vaporizers I'm gonna skip the videos because of time but I'd like to encourage you all to go and watch some of these things the making of concentrates are really simple the concept is really simple it's not hash like what you're used to what you do is you take an organic material in a closed area and you force the solvent through it so you take weed shake what's turned off of the buds you force the solvent through it and then what you have at the bottom is the solvent plus THC and then you refine and you do different things to it but but that's how you make a concentrate butane was have we all started butane was really effective at stripping THC and out of it so you start with butane propane is effective Everclear is effective Coldwater is actually really effective there are now gravity is also a great way to do this compression is so again to give you an idea of the scope of this and how much it's changed recently like this is purchasable for home use out of Boulder now this isn't this isn't like for the corporate producer this is a closed-loop extraction system that I can buy in my house because check here this one's more of a compression gravity mind your own gold so the value that we're talking about here just speaks for itself again I'm not gonna I hope that some of you will put this stuff in to YouTube tonight and watch people consuming concentrates because it's it's pretty profound here oh that this one's interesting I like to show this one because because this is he's a large man he's not a small guy and he samples this inside of the store and again most of these videos are sort of showing different things associated with it doesn't manifest how you're typically used to weed manifesting it manifests differently like these concentrates when you when you hit him for the first watch this guy kill a friend today on YouTube kill a friend day but what he does is he gives dedicated marijuana users the first concentrate hit and then he films it what we are doing is trying to have relevant conversations with people and teach them how to navigate the world and the streets telling them about our experience learning how to drive in a hand-cranked Model T going 30 miles an hour down hill and they're like huh I don't understand you and we're like why don't you understand me because this is their world and that's ours because unless you consume something you purchased commercially in the last three years you're talking about something back there and they're talking about this because to them today weed looks fundamentally different to me you see that beautiful nut right there when I went down to the 203 and I bought a dub sack if I had one of these inside of it I was thrilled because that was weed to me today is butter it's wax it's shattered this is weed the technical definition every salt derivative extract of and concentrate from the cannabis plant the practical application for the people who are the young folks especially who are consuming today that's we this is weed and they believe this stuff that it's organic gluten free cage-free marijuana cuz to them that's that's weed and so is this I had to call the sponsee and ask him what this was when I saw it for the first time how about this see that's that's weed water and ice osmosis that's marijuana yeah right no oh it's not it's not no yo it is practically speaking and this you heard it here first a year from now when everybody's talking about this where you heard of here first THC a this is what it's all about these are all the specials in colorado these are front and center I go to dispensaries all the time there's a front and center in all of the dispensaries these are what the coupons are for this is what everybody's pushing THC a pure if we have more time and actually break down the chemistry of what it is here but it is can you imagine it's a distillate distillates the work you imagine the level of acumen you have to have to take a green organic material and turn it into that now it's we that's we this is marijuana today and we know it's not the narratives the narrative still exists that it's natural experts only now I'm gonna make you that person quick and the finest buds guide and westward this year we're lists all the strains and all the different places are selling them we started this came up this year with bubble hash wax shatter crystalline sauce live resin shatter for stronger and much more potent hi shadow is the way to go it's more pure due to the filtrations of the product subsequently removing many of the terpenes wax as a product using butane a liquid gas as a solvent to extract the main cannabinoids and terpenoids plants are immediately flash-frozen after being harvested sauce is a full-spectrum extract caviar is cannabis flower dipped in hash oil dried for a few hours and sprinkled or rolled in Keef distillates create one of the more pure cannabis products on the market distilling can have a noise down to the molecular level and delivering higher THC content this is it it's a molecular level separation of Delta 9 THC nothing not even a whole THC molecule the Delta 9 THC y'all no Snoop Dogg's those wait nope Willy cells week and if Willie Nelson moves you to get high I don't really give a crap what you do if Snoop Dogg moves you to get high though I actually do care because that's a different generation of some younger people snoop sells concentrates because he's smart he's a good businessman 7/10 is oil upside-down july 10th is the new day stop saying 4/20 you sound old say 7 10 and people go huh crap you know going back to nature don't forget your natural cannabis where your concentrate headquarters the narrative still exists that this is natural it is not it's not and until we have a much better idea of what these are doing to people's brains and bodies you're ready for this giant like they don't belong in the world period the only place they belong in is in the portfolio somebody's trying to get paid off of this substance they don't belong being consumed until we have a much better idea of what they're doing inside of brains and bodies however we sold more of these in Colorado than the file why money's at 80/20 look this came out in Scentsy magazine last month it's normals magazine that they published now do you even dad Brooke oh yeah all day every day look good here we get that occasionally I'd say I dabble in uh no honestly it looks like you're smoking crack oh you don't know okay do you consume any kind of mayor marijuana at all no well then you should try vaping because here's what if you don't consume now try vaping and then we're gonna move you ultimately down to concentrate consumption well yeah I do okay let's get you how do we get you down to concentrate consumption first one's on me I heard that one before vaporizers you need to know one thing no smoke no smell no mess you need to know that they come in like they this was funny CPS and Denver ran this thing and said vaping is easy to hide these kids and their nicotine vaping and they showed that picture and I was like hold up that's a pax so it's a THC specific vaporizer and anything that's even nicotine specific on YouTube in 30 seconds you can learn how to take a jewel and make it into a distillate vaporizer so they look like this they look like this that's a functional pen that you use for inhaling concentrates it's a tac specific vaporizer these are THC specific vaporizers for your belt or your shoe they have a little curve in them that's like eating dessert with your lungs this is a disposable THC specific and I love it our concentrates taking over the marijuana market these are THC specific vaporizers that was high time magazines product of the year in 2017 and there's your bubble gum flavored one so the thing you gotta understand about these things is there's no smell with them consume didn't consume now edibles and I I have gone for minutes over this is where I'm gonna end it I'll run through the edible sports we're gonna have conversation we're skipping the mental health part and I'm skipping the hopeful part about how to effectively intervene I wrote a book and she's selling them it is like she's subsidizing them like Kim ordered all of these and you can't get them on Amazon or anything for that so it's all in there but here's what you got to understand about edibles man and this different in Pennsylvania right now right now but there's so much money to be made in these it's not gonna stay different forever this is a pack of gummy bears by a company called Etta pure and in Colorado ten milligrams of THC is a legal dose now because there's science behind that most people and the medical community said well none is a safe dose if we have to we'll say five milligrams but none is the only safe dose this is what they agreed on in the committee's because we had 13 months to build all this infrastructure there's 10 gummy bears in a package 10 milligrams of the legal dose implication is simple there's a hundred milligrams of THC in each one of those gummy bears there's my rendition of this back home I've read a whole chapter on this and a chat like it's incredible when a cannabis industry association is like oh we can't possibly change the way we're producing it we'd have to repurpose machines and stuff look you'd have to oh hey there repurposing machine ok because because nobody's eating attempting going here and this these are the problems these are the acute issues that people suffer because because the way it works I'll check this out see that little candy right there that's a distillate the distillates are all making their way into edibles now because nobody eats that 1/100 of a graham cracker what happens is okay so look if I'm getting high and getting high and getting high and I start to feel a little weird what do I do I stop getting high like I put the gun down and they step away from the button I put Darkseid in and I just mellow mellow if I ingest more than ear of this gummy bear and I'm used to getting high this problem with edibles we're used to alcohol in this quick smoke hitting us hit as quick because we got to wait for 40 minutes and then we're like why am I not feeling anything maybe I got the ear without the THC in at night the rest of it you can't do anything there's nothing you do activated charcoal no inducing vomiting nope you can hydrate and you've short-term antipsychotics but that's it what the only thing you can do is ride the ride and this where people are getting into trouble in Colorado and my hats off to Pennsylvania thus far for not allowing edibles to do anything like this but but they're here it was funny when I was at the school yesterday one of the young guys I was talking with it was like everything I buy is Colorado everything's come straight from Colorado but concentrates to edibles to the plant because we're sore stick with us or state now for it so here's your lesson and this is where we're gonna end it and go to questions which some of which I hope of ask about hopefulness and effective interventions but if it can be introduced into the human body it has been commercially produced with TAC nm they have yet to find an exception and if it's being commercially produced with THC in it there's a market for it especially in places that don't have dispensaries so coffee post tattoo anointment toothpaste vaginal suppositories the staggering variety begs the question what can we infuse hot sauce ketchup barbecue sauce coffee cake up coffee candy granola bars ice cream nasal mist this is remarkable and new this is faced faster than smoking or safer than smoking faster than edibles small and discreet it's topical THC that effects you psycho actively that's wild stuff it's new brand new brand new it use anywhere anytime here's a swallowable pill again a fairly impressive feat it's got to be activated Delta nine there's a sucker with 70 milligrams in it here's tea little candies little gummies a happy pill that looks a lot like a Reese's that's for real that's not a joke that's for real you see these things going around sometimes you're like Oh somebody's messed with you know that's actually something called a pop rock and it's the kids candy with THC and it there's Tarts here's THC infused alcohol do you ever come home after a long day work and feel torn between which substance you want to use to escape reality this is the obvious that you know the highest year that everybody had this idea that we're gonna replace one with the other the highest three years of alcohol tax revenue Colorado has ever collected have been since we commercialized THC there's a eighty five milligrams of sugar and 350 milligrams put that into YouTube tonight Keef Cola there's a spoiler alert the kids drinking that no kids because that doesn't appeal to me aren't drinking a 35th of the bottle anybody keep after rap culture is THC syrup here's 99% pure THC watermelon flavored drink here is THC water Tec chai tea and juice and mints and suckers and swedish fish and candy bars and cookies and hot cocoa and caramel and the March Madness bracket candy bars liquid THC 5-hour energy caffeine plus THC THC breath spray and as the THC breast spray is something it works out for you either as a THC infused Lube and here's a THC infused suppository 70 milligrams in its seven doses so when I asked the young lady when I bought these how I was supposed to consume one-seventh she was like come on I was like do I put like a seventh into my rectum and break it off or do I like wait for an hour - and she's like come on it should be on a documentary that's coming out here the lady record it's called pot luck the lady recorded it all and she's like no come on and I was like well seriously I don't understand how 1/7 of this enters my butt and change he's like just oh this is the back of the candy bar about another day there may be health risks associated with the consumption of this product this product contains marijuana and its potency was tested within an allowable plus or minus of 15% variance here's our mental health our physical health is in here as well here's pregnancy which is a huge deal in Colorado and here's some incredibly interesting places to go look for more information I've gone over let's have our dialogue time thing you know when she went when Kim called she's a friend of a friend and when Kim called and said I know this person and I know and loved them too and she said we I was in Pennsylvania last week for the Pennsylvania DUI Association Annual Meeting and flying from Colorado to here's a lot and I wasn't too crazy about it and then she told me the format which was like discuss some of the times I wonder why the reason like I got it maybe we're in the place we're at in our country because we aren't having awkward and challenging conversations and because we're not willing to say actually I totally disagree with that I completely disagree with that I don't know you but I'm gonna share something from my heart with you like I think I think like this fixes the world when people sit down and talk in a respectful manner so like I came because of this part so enjoy and thank you [Applause]", "vmAg5pJjMwU": "what's up custody bicker with the video of them tentacle so you have to make ice lollies and stuff like that so number one we're gonna need like I recommend you to use plastic cup but no plastic cup so I'm gonna do it and then we're gonna do next oh just put it and then we're gonna do an X or Y or black are you stupid stupid you want to put it in the fridge after you put it in the fridge I can if I get this wrong comment below I think after that you get to know what they need to put sugar in you right now then after you put sugar and you put it in the fridge let it be for one hour you take it out you little at this and it's ice cream lolly so the ability is good by the way we don't add sugar than it will just taste like ice with this so I hope you have enjoyed the video on Pisa", "GhBJwctKtTY": "hey guys this is Chris with CBD Informer and today we're going to do a hip bombs review for you and I'm gonna go over some of their products they've actually sent me quite a few of them I've used most of them some of them I don't I don't vape so I didn't use their vaping stuff most are products I've used and so far I'm really enjoying their products so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna put a link directly under this video that'll take you to their site and if there's a coupon code available I want to have that beside of it you can use to get an extra discount on your purchases but they do have some products that I favor more than others and that's what I'm gonna kind of talk about today and his hip balms review and so one of the first products that I tried from them was their max chill their hip balms max chill because one thing that I tend to need in the evenings more than anything else with having four kids and doing home schooling and stuff is being able to relax and just chill in the evening and so this stuff actually works really really well just to kind of calm you down to get you more relaxed and I don't recommend taking this until the evening because it can also make you drowsy and want to go to sleep one of the mistakes I made with their night time gummies is that I thought I would try them in the afternoon because you know with a lot of the previous CBD products that I've tried they didn't have much of an effect but the night time dummies I definitely do not take them in the afternoon because the ingredients in them will kind of really make you drowsy in the afternoon and not want to do much at all but except dragged throughout the day so keep that in mind if you buy any of hemp balms products now they also have a it's a it's called complete relaxation syrup and this is a pretty good-sized bottle now I also have here there's CBD oil and this is 300 milligrams and if I hold them up you can see the size comparison now with the CBD syrup this here has it says servings per container for there's only four servings in this entire bottle so this and it's it has 25 milligrams of CBD per serving so keep that in mind when you take this it is a big bottle it's used for pain and stress relief and help you to relax and sleep a mood enhancer it does taste good it's fruit punch flavored this one here is I'm not sure if they have other flavors but it does taste good but there's only four servings in one bottle this so I recommend if you are looking for a CBD that's really trying to help you with some kind of problem you're facing maybe pain anxiety or something where you're needing a stronger quality type CBD than to go with their oil go with a higher strength of their oil this here's 300 milligrams it may help you but if you're dealing with something pretty severe you may want to really increase that up and go beyond 300 milligrams and if you haven't yet that may be why it's not helping because you need to probably try to get maybe 50 milligrams it up per day I wouldn't go beyond 75 or 100 especially if you're just starting that's actually quite a bit but that's a good place to start if you are suffering from something pretty severe they also have CBD oil for dogs we do have two dogs but I've never tried this it probably a good idea because especially during storms they tend to really get shaky they want to jump on walls knock down stuff and they just they just go crazy during storms but this here is chicken flavored and it says it also helps with joint support natural pain relief and overall wellness they do have beard oil I like it it's pretty good stuff they have CBD vape products CBD vape complete relaxation watermelon I don't vape so I've never tried this but the smell is amazing so if you do vape and if you've tried any of these this one's wild blueberry jam let me know leave a comment underneath about what you thought about those so other people can have an idea they do have a pain freeze it's for sore muscles and joints it smells create like most other of your menthol type creams and lotions and you kind of see inside there it's a it is a cream it's kind of it kind of remind you of hair gels what it reminds you of but it rubs in really nice it doesn't leave a greasy filling or anything and it does seem to help a little bit I have one really bad need that gives me a lot of problems have it completely reconstructed just when I was a little kid and it still gives me problems and I'll use that once in a while one and it does seem to help some there's also a CBD beard balm it does okay I'm not too crazy about the bombs for the beers but if you're in that kind of stuff you may want to look at that and then they also have for tattooing that's called CBD ink aftercare you can put on kind of see with your skin make it a little better other than that couple of the art products I have is the mega dose CBD blend of the capsules so once again I'm going to go back to the point to where if you're suffering from something where you really need a good dosage or quality of CBD go with the CBD oil or go with the CBD capsules because they're gonna provide you with the most and the best relief in my opinion these here says pain relief mood enhancer natural sleep alleviate stress calm relaxation so one to two capsules a day and there are not sure what the dosage is in this 15 milligrams of CBD per one capsules so this one's not very strong here and then CBD gummies these things taste amazing if you've ever taken CBD gummies before I've tried some that are not very good at all if they're just nasty these tastes very good and one gummy there's 15 milligrams of CBD but there's also 2 grams of carbs or 2 grams of sugar so keep that in mind if you're trying to stay away from sugary products that's obviously one reason why these do taste pretty good and the other thing I want to mention is some of him mom's products have extra ingredients in them that you won't find in other products to kind of help intensify their effects for example in the gummies and some of their other products they tend to have what they call passiflora which is a product it's like an herb that really kind of helps to increase the effectiveness of being relaxed kind of in the evening when you just want to just calm down that kind of helps with that overall and you'll find that in their ingredients so as you go through their website that links directly under this video you can go through there and be sure you look at the ingredients because some of those have those in there and they seem to really have a little bit of an extra effect then over the CBD products that don't have those in there so that's my hip balms review I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did visit their website through the link under this video and see if there's any coupon codes down there you guys can use usually they're offering some kind of promotion code or that you can grab and pick up some products and get them a little bit cheaper hope you guys enjoyed this if you did like my video subscribe to my channel playing well putting out more video reviews of CBD companies I have tons and tons of CBD products from many different companies that I've tried over the past couple years and I plan on putting those reviews up here soon so hope you guys enjoyed it have a great day", "d3yv7aUaWJo": "hi everybody this is dr. Kurt Weiler checking it again for another monthly webinar through Great Plains I appreciate you joining me tonight and tonight we're going to talk about Alzheimer's disease I've done a presentation in the past on Alzheimer's that was really primarily focused on methyl b12 and I threw some information in there about brain inflammation too we're going to talk about that again and but I've got some new information in this presentation as well cut towards the end oh well I'll show you as we go it's talking about something called phospholipase a2 the CDP choline supplement and how it's not only useful for inflammatory disorders it's actually something that's being researched in autism too so kind of a side note there but it's it it's something that's really compelling and so if you are a doctor who works with patients with Alzheimer's or perhaps you're you have a mom or a dad or a family member who's dealing with us it's not a bad idea to get that phospholipase a2 test and consider doing some of the therapy I'm going to be talking about tonight so with that let's go ahead and get started and Daniel we just make sure to let me know my internet still is connecting it seems like it's okay now but just give me a heads up okay if there's any problems okay so I wrote a book a number of years ago on methyl b12 it's a guidebook for parents and doctors looking to implement methyl b12 therapy for autism well I took some of that same information and expanded it because what you'll find an eye is a lot of literature a lot of scientific research that's been going into the methylation issues and autism also correlate with Alzheimer's disease and so I created a book based on that arm and it's a guidebook to sobe a guidebook for individuals looking to implement methyl b12 therapy or practitioners looking to implement this for their patients and I talked in this book you know about oral form nasal forms as well as things like n-acetylcysteine and methyl folate too so it's not just methyl b12 one other thing that I'm going to incorporate into this talk that it didn't last time was the use of the organic acid test now I'm not doing an entire talk on the organic acid test but if you've listened to my presentations before you know that I am a big fan of this test matter of fact we are now going around the country and doing one day intensive seminars for doctors in various cities we've already done Seattle houston san francisco in san diego our next stop is in chicago and then we go to DC and then canada and they'll be more expand will be more added from there so these are for healthcare practitioners if you're a doctor position you know a nurse nature path nutritionist whatever go to Great Plains laughs calm and look for the one day organic acid training seminar think you'll find it incredibly helpful and see if it's coming to your local area but for those of you who aren't docs and it doesn't matter this is a document you should absolutely have and you can go to Great Plains laboratory calm and go into the oat section the organic acids testing section and download this you can download it as a PDF you could throw it on your desktop print it out whatever but is a very very useful guide if you will on what are the different markers on the organic acid test what do they mean clinically so we'll talk about a few that stuff tonight so we're going to talk real briefly about some of the Alzheimer's disease disease statistics the brutality figures Alzheimer's disease you know the cost and then we'll get more into the meat of the presentation no B vitamins and dementia how does that fit in what are some additional and associated problems that that individuals with Alzheimer's can have and then I'm gonna talk specifically about netflow late n-acetylcysteine and an expanded talk on methylation specifically methyl b12 and it will will briefly touch on some other forms of b12 that can be used as well i'm going to introduce the concept of medicinal cannabis in alzheimer's disease there's actually some very compelling research out there and I'm going to throw a little kind of a twist in here we talk so much about yeast you know chronic Candida problems well there's a link actually between chronic Candida and Alzheimer's and this is my feeling of why this test the organic acid test needs to be run in anybody with Alzheimer's disease and it will end with the discussion on this thing called phospholipase a2 and the CDP choline supplementation so what are you know the current statistics on Alzheimer's well unfortunately there's about five and a half million citizens in the US as of 2013 diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and and approximately you know five million individuals over the age of 65 fall in that group so it's a it's a disease condition that is unfortunately on the rise it's the most common form of dementia with about accounting for about sixty to eighty percent of all cases of in dementia in the US and a staggering statistic is by the estimated by the year twenty thirty the population over the age of 65 will encompass upwards of seventy two million people in the US alone with Alzheimer's that will make up about twenty percent of the u.s. population which is scary sad devastating we right now though Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the US and fifth leading cause of people of the age of 65 and you know in today's statistics one and three seniors essentially will die of either Alzheimer's or some other type of dementia the costs are staggering as well we hear a lot you know these days about medical care costs and and all these types of things well with the rising population rising rates of Alzheimer's I mean the amount of cost that this takes is going to be tremendous they figure that you know you know as of 2050 which seems like a long way off but it's not that far off we could be looking at one like two trillion dollars per year in health care costs just just related to Alzheimer's and you know approximately as of today it's it's upwards of 200 three billion dollars you know as of actually 2013 so huge change an impact on the medical system and the medical costs in taking care of these individuals well there are a lot of causes and implications for things implicated in Alzheimer's we know that various B vitamins can be linked to various forms of dementia specifically something like b1 which is a thiamine deficiency is seen in a condition called wernicke Korsakoff syndrome vitamin b3 in a deficient state can lead to pole egra and both of those things can manifest as dementia probably more common though is the link between vitamin b12 deficiency which has been seen in dementia it's also been correlated with things like depression mania psychosis and probably more commonly in what I see in the general population is just different types of neuropathy which is you know disorders of the peripheral nerves in the body if we look at the b12 issue a little bit deeper though we know that vitamin b12 just a group in itself would be 12 because there's different forms of b12 there's hydroxy b12 cyano be 12 the Dennis Philby 12 methyl b12 but b12 as a group is primarily responsible for removing a compound called methylmalonic acid now methylmalonic acid can actually be tested for off the organic acid test another benefit of why that test is important and generally methylmalonic acid increases when b12 is low and that concur occur from people who are pure vegetarian diets they don't eating meat at all defective absorption so there can be things like celiac disease bacterial dysbiosis helical daftar pylori which is a bacterial infection in the stomach can obliterate some of the cells that produce intrinsic factor which is needed to absorb b12 and then there are some other you know defective conversion issues that occur I think less commonly so the general population one reason to do the organic acid test is to look for dysbiosis intestinal yeast intestinal bacteria things that could be blocking the body's utilization and absorption of b12 now symptoms of b12 deficiency are kind of vague weakness and fatigue well you can see that a lot of people sore mouth and tongue now that may be a little bit more isolated to a b12 deficiency psychosis and depression I mean the reality is traditional medicine doesn't you know I mean really doesn't look too they don't look too deep at some of these things unfortunately numbness and tingling in the hands and feet can be a social would be 12 deficiency certainly confusion we know as well as diarrhea but what's interesting is you see if this thing was to come up for me here is anemia is quite common particularly somebody called macrocytic which is where the the red blood cells enlarge because you're not getting enough b12 macrocytic is also called megaloblastic anemia and commonly you can do a blood test that will help determine whether somebody has elevated or excuse me expanded red blood cells with large bread blood cells particularly in what's called the mean corpuscular volume that's where the volume of the red blood cell is expanding and that can be done off of a basic complete blood panel or a comprehensive metabolic panel then you have to determine if that's the case is it from folate or is it from a b12 deficiency because full weight can cause megaloblastic anemia as well and we know that b12 deficiency can cause it to so you can do a blood test where you look at MCV red blood cell hemoglobin hematocrit etc and then you can also run a serum b12 in a serum folate another way of determining whether the megaloblastic anemia is coming from b12 or a folate deficiency is the organic acids test if the methylmalonic acid on the organic acid test is normal then it really points more towards a full eight deficiency this can be cross-checked by looking at something called the uracil marker off the organic acid test from Great Plains because uracil is directly linked to the function and metabolism of folate matter of fact in about ten percent of the organic acid test that I see with special needs kids they have an elevated uracil now that could be that there's a deficiency in folate or it could mean that there's a metabolic problem which may link back to things called you know the MTHFR enzymes which we'll talk about here shortly okay and this is just a snapshot of that particular section on the organic acid test the perimeter metabolites uracil in about ten percent of the cases I see this elevated with kids on the spectrum and so that links to folate metabolism well there are other associated problems with Alzheimer's particularly with the neural chemical called acetylcholine and this is an important arrow chemical in the brain because it's involved in memory formation learning and attention matter of fact there are medications that actually are used to try to help improve the function of acetylcholine aricept for example is a prescription medication that's called an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor what it's doing is it's blocking the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine so the acetylcholine that's sitting in this in the synapse that space between nerve cells has a chance to function for a longer period of time that's what an acetyl choline a cholinesterase inhibitor does well that brings us in links to this new product this thing called CDP choline cytokine diphosphate choline this is not like aricept this is not a phospho inhibitor acetylcholinesterase inhibitor what this does is improves the functionality of nerve cells particularly by inhibiting something called phospholipase a2 now choline is join together with the acetyl group to become acetylcholine so the choline actually has a beneficial feeding mechanism if you will to try to resupplied normal levels of acetylcholine for individuals with a depletion of that neural chemical so it has a dual effect it not only helps to build up the seed of choline levels but it also helps to inhibit this chemical called phospholipase a2 which we'll talk about here shortly well there are other problems in Alzheimer's as well particularly the brain inflammatory issues that can occur when you get premature premature cell nerve cell death or damage within the cells now a lot of this is thought to occur because of poor methylation which is then linked to glutathione deficits when you have a deficit in glutathione you get an increase in oxidative stress and unfortunately all of that can coincide with what's called a glutamate receptor hypersensitivity problem and we'll talk about that shortly as well people of Alzheimer's many times have mitochondrial issues too so this has been seen we know in the autism community well it's also been correlated and seen in patients with Alzheimer's and dementia because the reality is things that are happening in the mitochondria are necessary for the energy production that our brain needs or nervous system needs and the function of the rest of our body and so essentially through the Krebs cycle the electron transport chain the mitochondrial energy factories circuitry here we're producing these energy substrates this energy chemical called ATP and our body is heavily dependent upon this the nice thing by doing an organic acids test and that I pointed out a lot of conferences I do is you do get a snapshot of Krebs cycle metabolites kreb cycle is what's being found in the mitochondria so you can get an idea are there problems now many times what you'll find with slight elevations and some of these chemicals you know like the malic acid or the apathetic acid or even saxena gases that might just be barely high a couple points above the reference range that often strongly correlates back to a chronic yeast end or bacterial level so what that means is that there may be a functional imbalance occurring in the mitochondria being negatively influenced by something else in the body however when the markers start getting significantly high well then you're probably looking at more of a deep-seated problems in the mitochondria as well so there's not a set number that's been established for every person of every age of every weight but generally for example the higher they are the more significant problems you might see for example the saxena Cassatt if you're getting above 50 points on that level you're dealing with more of a significant mitochondrial problem you can see in this particular person it was sitting at 105 well I mentioned before the receptor hyperreactivity that can occur in nerve cells and that one particular receptor is called NMDA there are other excitatory receptors as well but em NMDA plays a big role what happens is as NMDA is activated by different things like glutamate and opens these channels so that we get a transfer of information electrical information that flows into the cell that then excites that nerve cell to stimulate the next nerve impulse the problem is is if you get too much receptor stimulation you can cause damage within the cell and that damage can lead to inflammation in fact there's a medication called namenda and one of the things that namenda does is it blocks NMDA receptors it's basically blocking that signal trying to slow down the stimulation that's occurring within nerve cells and this medication is primarily used in Alzheimer's there's actually research to show that it's useful in Alzheimer's excuse me in autism too and I've used in that case but namenda is very useful in in blocking NMDA receptor activity and what they found is less emotional instability a slowing progression of the disease improve memory retention of recall and my experience namenda is actually a very safe and often effective medication normally for Alzheimer's patients it's dosed at a higher dose that might be used with the special-needs kids you know upwards of 20 milligrams for an adult patient per day well the nice thing is is there are some natural remedies that are there kind of namenda like I can't say they have the the same effect is the same efficacy as namenda but they they have a function where they can help to regulate and kind of block the NMDA receptors themselves l-theanine is an extract of green tea and what it helps to do is it helps to it basically helps to block glutamate excitotoxic City on these various receptors in the brain it doesn't have the exact same effect is namenda but it's a supplement option usually somewhere between four to six capsules per day so it has a similar effect the other thing is lithium not not medication lithium but nutritional lithium it has a similar effect it helps to regulate NMDA receptor activity it actually can be used along with thinning to have an additive effect it's been used in other mental health disorders like bipolar it either comes as an elemental or what's called oral or orotate lithium as a supplement there's no one specific dose for everybody so it's kind of a range lithium orotate 10 to 20 milligrams for an Alzheimer's patient would certainly be appropriate and often times you can do a hair analysis where you'll find that the lithium levels are quite low well all of this hypersensitivity receptor and the depletion of glutathione and methylation defects etc can set us up for great inflammation and and this image here is really kind of putting that out we've got the blood-brain barrier and the blood-brain barrier think of it like the barrier in the digestive system that mucosal lining that's trying to block bad stuff from getting into the bloodstream but letting the good stuff in the blood-brain barrier kind of acts the same way it's trying to block the bad stuff from reaching the brain substance and let the good stuff in unfortunately we can get a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier which then leads to brain inflammation and in that particular case we're dealing with a couple cells that are within the brain substance itself that play a tremendous role Astra glia our cells that help with the physical structure of the brain they help support the blood-brain barrier they're also involved in repairing injury and helping to absorb nutrients it's the microglia that become really the problem in this discussion and again this is correlated the special needs community to my quickly is the main immune defense of the brain make up about twenty percent of all glial cells and these are the cells that initiate the inflammatory response appropriately when there is some kind of invading pathogen whether it's a bacteria or a virus the problem is is when these microglia become chronically activated and turned on in some cases they don't turn off and that that reaction leads to something called micro gliosis microglia activation and we can have different things that trigger it you can have an inflammatory trigger LPS for example is a toxin that's produced by bacteria beta amyloid okay this is something we'll talk about here more shortly beta amyloid is a compound that is seen elevated in Alzheimer's that is a direct inflammatory trigger of microglia activation and when Apple microglia become activated they produce a lot of factors a lot of chemicals in the short term that could be beneficial because it could be necessary to defeat a pathogen like you get a bacteria or virus you need things like nitric oxide and whatnot to kind of combat it the problem is that the signal never turns off you get a lot of collateral damage and that leads to neuronal death and damage you know adjacently that damage then can lead to further factors so basically you get the point it's it's a cyclical process sometimes that just doesn't end and that's the real problem microglia are involved themselves in the blood brain barrier to just like the the astroglial and here we have an image where we're going to see these spindle e spider type things that are surrounding themselves around the retina of the eye that is the microglia setting up the blood-brain barrier well it turns out that amyloid this abnormal protein that is associated with Alzheimer's the beta amyloid can actually trigger microglia themselves so if you have an accumulation of beta-amyloid that amyloid triggers the microglia as a chronic stimulus and the microglia then generate all of these pro inflammatory chemicals and so it just creates this vicious cycle effect this is an image here of microglia actually attacking an amyloid plaque so not only the amyloid plaque triggering the microglia then the microglia turned back on them the amyloid plaque itself generating more inflammation so you can see where we could get stuck in this vicious cycle of reactive micro gliosis the other thing that I mentioned is nitric oxide microglia activation releases large amounts of nitric oxide now in the short term that could be beneficial because it can help to to neutralize a pathogen the problem is is too much nitric oxide formation can become stressful in the brain and one of the things that will do is it depletes glutathione reserve so we need that glutathione antioxidant to combat against too much inflammation and too much oxidative stress so you can see where there's a lot of research in the Alzheimer's community linking the role of methylation to oxidative stress and this is just a few examples here now what the ones that I actually highlighted here in red are really specific because we can see where there's an oxidative stress role and progression of Alzheimer's and studies that actually show using methylation supplements to try to slow this progression down and this particular one they were looking at a supplement called n-acetylcysteine now n-acetylcysteine is a very useful supplement there's actually some interesting research in the use of n-acetylcysteine because it's known to help improve glutathione levels cysteine is a precursor to glutathione they've actually used n-acetylcysteine in a condition called trichotillomania which is a disorder of people pulling their hair out particularly pulling out their eyelids and their eyelashes eyelashes and n-acetyl cysteine has been useful in some patients with that but it's useful in Alzheimer's to to try to nullify some of the effects that are occurring with too much microglia activation and depletion of glutathione and using a well-tolerated supplement in ranges anywhere between 500 1000 milligrams per day are usually well tolerated sometimes you need to go up sometimes you don't necessarily know exactly how much somebody needs because again like a lot of these supplements they're not always dose based on age or weight arm but you know if you use too much n-acetylcysteine it's probably a good point to make particularly working with the geriatric population is to be conservative because if you get an acetyl cysteine levels up too high or you've got a patient who's taking something like nitroglycerin it can cause a lowering the blood pressure which can lead to headaches which can leave the lightheadedness and the last thing you want to have happen is somebody who has either pre dementia dementia or elderly is to have a fall because if they fall and they break a hip or get injured in other ways that can be devastating to well let's change gears a little bit and talk about folate and the effect of folate in this whole discussion folate and this is again if we if we sort of correlate the special these community in the Alzheimer's community you can see how there's a lot of crossover folate transport into the brain is quite complex it's not like we can just take a supplement novel you know immediately the brain levels go up what we have to have happen is a conversion of different forms of folate to get it into the active state that 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate form this is the form of folate that actually crosses the blood-brain barrier now folates are derived from plants particularly green leafy vegetables we can get it from grains and beans and we can certain factory and yeast can produce folates to folate biochemically helps provide some of the methyl groups that are needed to support Cabala mean or methylcobalamin within some of the converting enzyme systems that we need within the methylation cycle there's one particular enzyme called the finding synthase which is heavily dependent on adequate supply of folate to get the conversion moving through that methylation process well and I'm going to do an expanded talk on this in a couple months but we have what are called polymorphisms that can occur in these converting enzymes or what are called single nucleotide polymorphisms or snips and the main one we talked a lot about is MTHFR and there are there are different base pair positions that are needed for a lot of these enzymes to function appropriately and a lot of times you can get these base pairs switching for example cytosine as a base lot of times we'll switch with thymine or adding a lot of times we'll switch with guanine and you know there's up where there's huge amounts of these snips that occur in the general human genome but if we focus on the main one that really has its its finger its pulse on the methylation cycle we have to talk about MTHFR this methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase what it does is it methylates folic acid as a compound something called 510 methylene thf and it basically converts it into the bioactive form this 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate now this actually leads to homocysteine converting into methionine through them to the methylation cycle and when that occurs we get overall improvement in brain function we have greater attention we have greater fungus focusing we have greater memory recall we also have a boost in immune function downstream from this methylation cycle is the production of glutathione and we maintain our glutathione levels adequately as well that fact I've used things like methyl b12 and the autism community for year for years to have tremendous effect on kids ability to have improvement language eye contact attention focusing etc when we have a deficit where defects in our methylation system well we're going to have a whole host of problems not only do we have issues just with Alzheimer's but there are other things that can happen increased risk of stroke increased risk of various cancers neurotoxic effects of the depletion or the excess buildup of homocysteine which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease so there's a lot of things in play here if we just sort of break down the cycle and kind of step back and look at it here we have folic acid and folic acid has to be converted into something called tetrahydrofolate and we need to get this tetrahydrofolate to the bioactive form the form that can actually get into the brain to do its function across the blood-brain barrier and so it has to step through these different steps and it's this MTH of our enzyme that's critical in converting it from this 510 methylene position to the 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate and then once we have that in place it helps with transferring methyl groups to methyl b12 etc to help move this methylation cycle into proper position so if we have a prime at this level if we have a problem at this level or we have a problem at this level we have real issues what happens actually in a lot of research into autism is in some cases heavy metals like mercury can significantly impact this methionine synthase enzyme activity and that causes a block if we've got environmental toxins like metal toxicity and we've got a snip or two that's occurring in the MTH of our enzymes we're going to greet even further impact our ability to get our methyl folate levels up to normal and there's an interrelationship okay so we've got an interrelationship between all of these different systems the ability to regulate normal levels of serotonin and dopamine are endured interlocked with the MTH of our function which is interlocked with the folate system which is interlocked with the methylation system if we have a problem on this wheel will impact the folate impact methylation if we have a problem in our folate cycle will impact methylation and etc and so you can just see how all of these things are unified together one of the remedies that can be used and is often used when people have a depletion of methyl folate for example you see an elevated uracil on the organic acid test or you do an MTHFR genetic test looking at the c677t enzyme and you're finding it's either homozygous or heterozygous with one of the snips that occurs methyl Foley can be used as a supplement to help boost the active form of folate and this is a particular supplement that comes from your beginnings it's a thousand micrograms of the five metal tetrahydrofolate again there's no one established dose so generally I'm conservative the beginning and then work it up from there on average most adults you know take anywhere between two to three capsules a day some of the kids a little bit less sometimes you I need to go higher but it's an effective form of methyl folate because it is that would be active form there are also some pharmaceutical forms of this as well Devlin is a prescription form of methyl Foley it's the same methyl Foley it's there's nothing magical about it it's just that a pharmaceutical company said hey let's make it our own supplement and have it as a prescription and so they pick 7.5 or 15 milligram tablets nothing specific about those doses that's just the number that they picked so the one benefit of this is you if you need a lot of Memphis folate you can take one Devlin verse you know seven or eight capsules of methylphenidate it's not easily paid for the insurance Devlin is really marketed for depression for the Alzheimer's community there is something called Sarah fullen NAC and if you look at it it's interesting five point six milligrams of methyl folate a little bit of methylcobalamin and 600 milligrams of NAC you can get all this do a supplement to yeah it comes as a as a prescription this is both of these things are considered medical foods they're not a pharmaceutical drug per se their medical food because they are natural to the body and a son in it and you can get them as supplements but they are something that sometimes can be covered by insurance if you're lucky so let's talk about methyl b12 including methylation therapy if we kind of go back and look at the cycle again let me orient you this is just a little bit different way here so we have folic acid which enters this position at 5-10 methylenetetrahydrofolate and that 510 metro haja folate methylenetetrahydrofolate needs to become the active form at this 5-methyl thf position in order to do so it has to be converted through the MTHFR enzyme complex once except is 5-methyl th th up position it then cycles through this methionine synthase complex methylates b12 and essentially we've in priest or we've moved forward the entire methylation cycle by converting homocysteine to Matheny too much buildup of homocysteine has a cardiovascular risk if we have a block of not being able to convert the signing over we're going to have a slow down through the rest of the methylation cycle there are some other things that help to improve the methylation cycle here too choline for example can become bait betaine and betaine can help so help to increase the stimulation of homocysteine of Athenian conversion and this is a supplement called TMG for example TNG becomes dmg and this has a cyclical nature to it as well but the methylation supplementation is primarily was primarily used and helpful is methyl b12 well the methyl groups are really nothing more than a carbon and three hydrogen's attached and it can be attached to a lot of other different chemicals so this is a methyl group it can either be added to another chemical or taken away from a chemical to modify its function okay so sometimes when you add a methyl group to another compound it diminishes its function sometimes when you add it it improves its function it really just depends on what it is and methylation has its hands and a lot of things methylation has its hands in the immune system with respects to t cell formation necessary to fight viral infections for example I mentioned before it's important in glutathione production it's very helpful in cardiovascular health intestinal mucosa is dependent on pond adequate methylation attention and focusing melatonin production and then of course you know tryptophan methylation to help improve serotonin in the brain so methylation is is a really big deal and the reality is is if we don't have adequate methylation we're just not going to have good body function good brain function good nervous system function etc and if the methylation system breaks down even further well we're going to have a tremendous onset of disease so why is methylation so important in autism well primarily as i mentioned health attention focusing language and improvement in global awareness why is it so important Alzheimer's the same types of things improvement in global awareness improvement in memory and retention recall it helps to decrease the degeneration of cognitive function it's just critically important for overall brain health and everybody if you look at a lot of the research and autism there is a lot there with respects to methylation and oxidative stress of things that are impacting upon these different chemicals well that same kind of research exists in the Alzheimer's community as well this is just an example just a night this is actually these examples are taken from my book for this particular for this particular presentation what I've typically used not only for special needs kids but adults is the pre-filled methyl b12 injections and you can get these from most compounding pharmacies know how to do this or certain ones in the US that that do a good job that I talk about in my book and these are very very small insulin syringes made with a certain concentration of methyl b12 generally at 25,000 micrograms per ml concentration and then you figure out your your dose based on on weight and you can see here this is a very small needle compared to many other injections that are often given it so this is an injection that is often used subcutaneously they all come pre-filled from a designated compounding pharmacy with the specific amount inside and the injection point is that upper outer quadrant area of the buttocks now that could be not only in special needs kids but that can be in adults too and it's variable how much you give typically what i will do is start with an every read a prescription or in every three day dosing and then modify from there sometimes will increase the dose sometimes will increase the frequency the key is when you're doing a sub-q injection of methyl b12 we want to get it underneath the skin we're not injecting it straight into the muscle because we want the methyl b12 to crystallize under the skin just like you would want insulin to crystallize under the skin to get a consistent level of insulin release to maintain blood sugar the same with methyl b12 we don't want it metabolize too quickly we wanted to have a lasting effect it so that's why it's given underneath the skin in the buttocks the buttocks has a different type of fat that has a met different metabolic activity than other fat in the body and it's quite useful in doing it this way there are other forms of methyl b12 this is kind of a slide that I take from my autism slides on methyl b12 revita pop is a lollipop not a bad option a lot of the kids like it there is oral forms of methyl b12 as well a little bit more appropriate for adults and you can actually take the methyl mate here from new beginnings and convert it into a nasal spray matter of fact what you do I think I have a slide on that yeah here it is how can they come back though I'll come back to that it all depends these different vitamins have different absorption rates this is just this is a slide from some time ago but it just looked at the difference of blood levels from taking it you know orally as a tablet verse liquid verse nasal spray verse subcutaneous and clearly the subcutaneous levels get the blood levels up very high and stay consistently high the nasal sprays do a pretty good job to it you know but in some people they can drop pretty quickly but it definitely gets the levels up so sometimes with the nasal sprays you just have to do them more frequently it could be every day could be a couple times a day to maintain those levels oral forms are a little bit iffy and if you start looking at organic acid test and you realize that people have a lot of bacterial and yeast problems well their absorption of these things can you be more compromised here was methyl methyl mate is a nice form of liquid b12 from new beginnings it is an option where you can convert this into a nasal spray essentially what you do when you order the product you request that they send the nasal applicator with it they don't talk about on the site but they'll send it ok and you just take the dropper cap off and replace it with the nasal applicator and voila the methyl mate becomes a nasal spray each spray is approximately 500 micrograms now i wish i could say there was a specific dose of nasal spray that you would do that matches up exactly with the injections it just doesn't work that way usually a starting goes for the injections is you take your weight in pounds and if you don't know how to convert to kilograms just take your weight in pounds and divide it by 2.2 then you have your kilogram weight and you multiply that by 64.5 and I discuss this in the book that I wrote and that then becomes your dose of methyl b12 in the prefilled syringe when you're using the nasal spray it's it's a little bit more open-ended honestly so typically with adults you might start with two to three sprays a day each nostril you can always start with two sprays or one spray each nostril and kind of work it up from there generally with methyl made the nasal spray or methyl b12 injections you need to try it for a couple months to see what the overall effect will be in lot of the autistic kids they can respond quite quickly sometimes within the first week or two weeks but their kids you know they have a lot of vitality a lot of energy and older people the geriatric community Alzheimer's is a tough disorder you have to be patient it may not necessarily be this immediate effect that you're hoping for okay and the reality is they're older and so it just takes a little bit more time so at least you know some of these things need to be done for a couple months I think to see if they're having a positive effect and that a positive effect could be just improvement in cognition communication attention things that we talked about before oral forms of bait b12 or certainly available okay you can always do the methyl mate early or you can do a sublingual essentially the methyl made five drops is 1,000 micrograms most and this is just an example of not necessarily promoting the this particular b12 form but it's just an example I pulled up one tablet typically is a thousand micrograms so you know it's a place to start okay what are some things that have been recognized and observed well improve comprehension and understanding in increased environmental awareness kind of like what we see with the autistic kids and that could be awareness of the surroundings family members friends better attention improved focusing abilities better memory kind of things that we would expect so if you're interested in this you can always get this book and you just go to methyl b12 for Alzheimer's calm alright so let's shift gears now so that was talking about folate and acetyl cysteine and would be 12 in the link to microglia activation and all of this let's come back and focus a little bit more on the organic acid test on a few things and then talk about some other things are useful in Alzheimer's too okay this is part of a larger presentation i do on neural chemical imbalances in using the organic acid test and this is a little bit complicated but just bear with me here for a sec on the organic acid test in the neurotransmitter section there are various chemicals one of them is called quinolinic acid and quinolinic acid is a product of tryptophan you know that tryptophan is an amino acid that we get in our diet tryptophane is necessary for the production of serotonin serotonin is necessary in the brain to help melatonin serotonin we know is also important in language in fine gross motor skills in mood and happiness it's why so many people are on Prozac because everybody's so stressed out and depressed so we get take Prozac and some of these medications to boost our serotonin levels well it turns out that the tryptophane conversion to serotonin is also on the same pathway but kind of in the opposite direction to something called quinolinic acid or more specifically quinolinic Kiner etic acid pathways there are certain enzymes that convert tryptophane into quinolinic acid there's two of them tryptophane 23 dioxygenase in Ndola mean 23 dioxygenase stress adrenal stress cortisol can cause the production of tryptophane 23 dioxygenase to convert more tryptophane to quinolinic acid adrenal stress often leads to serotonin depletion and this is why many people with adrenal fatigue are often depressed indola mean 23 dioxygenase is influenced by a lot of other things it can be influenced by infections virus infections gamma interferon pro-inflammatory cytokines bacterial infections can all stimulate indola mean to 30 extra days or also called I do what happens is is quinolinic acid when it's produced in an adequate amount is necessary because it will directly have a killing effect on bacteria viruses and parasites but if there's too much of it it can cause damage okay so too much i do active activation causes too much tryptophan conversion too much quinolinic acid conversion and we've got too much of a problem it also turns out that beta amyloid found in Alzheimer's is a trigger for I do activities so it's increasing I do conversion of tryptophan to coin erotic acid and wouldn't you know it Candida is linked somehow which i'm going to show you what that is but before I do so let's have you go through this chart okay and this is I'm just going to keep this simple we're basically back up here at the top again here we've got tryptophane here we have I do and here we have the other enzyme we know that cortisol and stress can increase tryptophane 23 oxygenase and we know that other things like infections viruses etc can cause the ideal activity to go up as we pass through these different stages we're primarily passing through this particular stage of kinda Renick acid now it's interesting kind of Renick acid think of it as a break or a regulator over too much quinolinic acid production one of the other things the body does with quinolinic acid is it makes something called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide this nad chemical and nad where does that fit in I put it should have put a slide here nad fits right into the mitochondria we need nad in order to have proper mitochondrial function between the go-between between the krebs cycle and what's called the electron transport chain so quell the body is also converting tryptophane to coil anicassan to produce this nad we can have chemical exposure particularly these things called phthalates which are found in a lot of plastics cosmetics etc shampoos and an excess amount these phthalates will inhibit the production of nad causing greater Quantic acid this is for another lecture so again Olynyk acid is not a bad thing unless it's too much because it's necessary it plays a role in a direct having a direct anti pathogen effect and it also plays a role in energy substrate production for mitochondrial function well it turns out that quinolinic acid is also an activator of nmda receptors remember we talked about NMDA receptors and Alzheimer's and we have that education called namenda or things like theanine or lithium can help block NMDA receptor activity well too much Quinlan a gas that stimulates too much nmda receptor activity which stimulates too much influx of information into the cell which overwhelms the cell leads to oxidative stress glutathione deflation and premature cell death so that's an interesting link with respects to the organic acid test quinolinic acid and alzheimer's well it also turns out that beta amyloid from it found an odd Alzheimer's stimulate quinolinic acid themselves okay so that was another link and that Candida is somehow associated with this well it turns out that there's a couple things going on okay and this is just a couple statements here pointing this out that activated microglia because of excess beta amyloid production causes brain inflammation in Alzheimer's and then that quotient you know too much quinolinic gas production can lead to other problems as well and we know that beta amyloid okay can induce quinolinic acid production which themselves can induce microglia activation so you can see this vicious cycle but it also turns out what is beta amyloid it turns out that beta amyloid is an anti pathogen peptide it has an anti-candida effect so the question is is Candida a trigger for Alzheimer's I'm not stating that it is but I'm saying it's plausible there's potential for it if you follow the biochemistry and actually there is interesting information just available online that talks about this this is an article that talks specifically about the Alzheimer's disease associated amyloid beta protein is an antimicrobial peptide so one of the reasons that we have an increase in beta amyloid is in direct response to pathogens in the body IE candida and probably other bacteria and the beta amyloid is a trigger for the indole amine oxygenase enzyme which increases conversion of tryptophan to quinolinic acid the quinolinic acid has a direct neuro neurotoxic effect at a high level by over stimulating these NMDA receptors and then also beta amyloid is a direct trigger for microglia activation which then furthers great inflammation so again the organic acid test can play an important role in assessment for people with Alzheimer's to look at chronic yeast okay so we're almost to the end here but I just wanted to introduce some things on what are some things that might help with microglia activation and you know there's a lot of things in one of the other presentations I do and using things like ibuprofen and there's certain medications out there but I wanted to kind of introduce the concept of medicinal cannabis because we're reaching a point in history here in the United States where I believe you're going to start seeing more medicinal cannabis being used for a wide variety of things as state laws loosen up there's more of an expansion of this and there's a couple interesting research articles that talk about the therapeutic benefit of medicinal cannabis in helping to regulate microglia activation so this is not only just for Alzheimer's this could be for other neurological disorders to this could be for things like ms or even Parkinson's and even all autism where microglia activation plays a role the important thing here is understanding what receptors are being stimulated because most docs who are using medicinal cannabis are not interested in the psychoactive for of the medical marijuana which is linked more to the THC activity instead we're looking to use more of the high-dose cannabidiol the high CBD which has the non psychoactive component this is primarily stimulating the cb2 receptors because it's the can of a dial that has a direct effect on decreasing microglia activation in fact this particular study that was done in 2011 looked at just that ok it looked at cannabidiol to help reduce microglial activation in Alzheimer's and it was no word yet the cannabinoids were neuroprotective by essentially preventing the beta amyloid accumulation and induction of microglia activation ok and that these phytochemicals these vital cannabinoids cannabidiol this high CBD medicinal cannabis is shown to have anti-inflammatory properties now if you follow this story at all you might be familiar with the work that was done over the show that was shown on CNN and there was a young girl by the name of Charlotte Figi VG I think that's how you pronounce her name and she was a young girl that was diagnosed with a syndrome called Dravet Syndrome which basically she suffered from in control uncontrollable seizures and essentially her seizure disorder was was it cured significantly significantly improved I mean big time by using cannabidiol high CBD medicinal cannabis doesn't have the psychoactive effect ok but it has high CBD and in fact the organization that makes this kind of named this particular form of cannabis that they were using Charlotte's Web App in her honor there's an organization at a Colorado called realm of caring it's a non-profit foundation of the Stanley Brothers who work closely with the family of Charlotte Figi and they were actually highlighted on that CNN TV I'd encourage you to go look look that up online the amount of seizure this girl had was unreal I don't know how how she even survived or how the parents were even able to cope it was so severe so what they're doing is producing you know different cannabidiol tinctures of medicinal cannabis and they've used it very commonly in seizure disorders but there's also a lot of use in other disorders to multiple sclerosis Parkinson's certainly using it in Alzheimer's also and autism to matter of fact some of the feedback with parents who have used medicinal cannabis for their kids is less self-injurious behavior less aggressive behavior less anxiety and just an overall improvement in mood you know really kind of across the board for a lot of these kids so that's definitely something worth looking into okay so let's kind of finish up here on some new information some things that you need to be aware of and that has to do with something called phospholipase a2 phospholipase where these phospholipases are a group of enzymes that essentially catalyze what basically means to help release fatty acids that lead to elevations of certain inflammatory mediators and there's a group of these things called acosta noids from boxing leukotriene prostaglandins and the a2 phospholipase is actually named because of the specific function let me move this thing out of the way here this is a big function that it has at various functional groups within fatty acids and basically what's happening here is it's is the phospholipase a2 is acting upon this functional group at position 2 on this particular molecule okay this gets if you kind of look at this map back you actually if you go to grape cleanses website and look up phospholipase a2 this is kind of pulled right out that page so the fatty acid this fatty acid group is removed by the phospholipase a2 ooh and we also have phospholipase a2 acting at this group as well and what happens is is when we have pla2 activity you'll start to get these free fatty acids and this other compound called lie so lesson and these are both inducers of econ annoyed production the prostaglandins leukotrienes the arachidonic acid which essentially increase inflammation not only locally wherever it's occurring but systemically as well we'll talk here shortly that the CDP choline is an inhibitor of phospholipase a2 activity vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids are also helpful too well phospholipase a2 or pla 2 is present in human tissue as well and it can be activated by infection bacterial can do it candida can do it cluster it you can do it two things that could be picked up off the organic acid test and when pla 2 is released it sets this whole cascade of chemical events in place which causes damage to the cell membranes of those invading pathogens so that's the good thing the problem is we can get collateral damage and kind of like the microglia activation you can get collateral damage of the brain but but the effect is to try to damage the cell membranes of these pathogens help to denature the protein so that the cells these organisms just aren't functional anymore and just really mess with the cellular function but again it's that collateral damage effect turns out that bee stings spider bites and poisonous snake venom all contain this phospholipase a2 and that's built to actually cause the pain swelling and inflammation that that comes about from that so when you get a local release of phospholipase a2 you can also get a systemic effect because the pla 2 is then transported in the blood stream and that can cause problems elsewhere and so there's a wide variety of disorders that have been linked to elevations of the phospholipase a2 al oh jeez asthma various autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid significant it's been shown to be elevated in autism with the autism spectrum kids brain trauma a brain trauma concussion injuries are something that has been associated with the phospholipase a2 it's elevated in cancer many cancers definitely elevated in cardiovascular disease and then a host of other things as well inflammatory bowel disease mental health disorders and here we have neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's well quoting dr. Shaw from Great Plains and this is a quote that actually comes from the article that he wrote in the development of Alzheimer's disease the abnormal phospholipase a2 levels appear to be related to oxidative signaling pathways involving the NADPH oxidase and the production of reactive oxygen species are OS that lead to impairment and destruction of neurons and inflammation of glial cells let's now to go back to this issue of Astro glia and microglia this comes full circle for us because pla2 can now be involved in inducing inflammation and very likely activation of these glial cells including microglia activation okay and then this is just a study that is looking specifically at elevations of phospholipase a2 in association with Alzheimer's disease and this came out and actually this was 1996 so this is quite some time ago and basically the summary findings were the findings have elevated phospholipase a2 immunoreactivity and Alzheimer's these brain supports the hypothesis that there is an active inflammatory process occurring in Alzheimer's disease this is actually a snapshot of the phospholipase a2 test from Great Plains you can see in this particular case we've got a mark of the elevated marker okay so what can help decrease phospholipase a2 what can bring down an elevated level well steroids can do it so cortisol this is why I often will do adrenal testing in adults to look at cortisol levels cortisol derivatives deck neo dexamethasone prednisone those will all help the lower it interesting lithium can lower it certain anti-seizure medications and anti-malarial medications I'm not necessarily using anti-malarial medications but just an interesting side note some remedies other supplements though vitamin E DHA epa which are omega-3 fatty acids are all inhibitors of phospholipase a2 activity let's focus here on this supplement called cited een five die Fausto choline or CDP coaling it turns out that CDP choline is a precursor to phospholipid production phospholipids are these these substances in the cell membranes of our cells they help to increase plasticity pliability flexibility of our of ourselves and if they're in the brain and nervous system they help to increase flexibility and plasticity if you will and the communication network that is necessary for cell-to-cell communication and so the CDP choline is important for that there have been studies that have looked at a wide variety of dosing of CDP colon anywhere between 500 to 4,000 milligrams per day and that's a pretty rough broad range I mean I understand that in various you know mental health and neurodegenerative conditions schizophrenia Alzheimer's which we're talking about Parkinson's etc head trauma certainly an ischemic stroke I think this is an important remedy for people who've had head trauma you know athletes and whatnot who were had concussions certainly would be important for them and think it's also being shown that it's going to become an important remedy for a lot of the spectrum kids to the reality is is like a lot of supplements sometimes the trial of it is important i think it would be useful to get the phospholipase a2 level first and then track that level with along with your CDP choline dosing but you know generally about a thousand milligrams per day is well tolerated it seems to improve cognitive performance improving blood flow performance improving Blaine of brain electrical activity not a lot of side effects in some of the cases you can get some mild gastrointestinal symptoms if the dose gets too high everybody's a little bit different that's not specific to c DB choline that could be related to any supplement honestly depending on how sensitive somebody is but there really have been no major side effects no blood chemistry changes seen on blood testing so CDP choline is definitely a strong inhibitor of the phospholipase a2 and I think a worthwhile you know supplement to consider so with that that is the the end of my presentation tonight I appreciate everybody's attention I know there's probably some questions that people had asked I'm not able to answer questions through this presentation but those questions will be catalogued by Great Plains and then what they do is they email them to me a few days later could be a week or so that I'll get those and then I'll answer those questions on email and those answers will come back to you this particular presentation has been recorded and will be up on Great Plains as website shortly probably within a week so you can go if you want to listen to it again if you want to share it if you want to link it to somebody a friend a family member to listen to you can go to Great Plains laboratory calm and go under their webinar section the webinar library and look for this specific presentation which was methyl beef which is Alzheimer's disease methyl b12 dementia and integrative medicine if you are interested in contacting

so with that everybody I appreciate your joining in tonight I hope this was useful for you and we will see you again in another installment of Great Plains laboratory educational webinars we'll talk

classic the chicken lollipop and it's all about the presentation with that said we're going to pack a ton of flavor into these things but before we can do that we've got to get them trimmed up so as you can see we're working with the chicken drumsticks today and what we're going to be doing to prepare these for the lollipop style is we're going to make an incision or a cut all the way around the leg here we're going to remove all of these tendons and skin from the top half and push the rest down to the bottom to form sort of a lollipop shape usually what i do here is i come into where that meat is starting to meet the bone and i'll make a slice straight down we're trying to get rid of most of these tendons that are honestly the reason i don't eat drumsticks very often because i just don't like all the tendons and stuff in there but what we're going to do is we're going to cut right through them so you want to get all the way down to the bone start scraping that up and then once it's clean like that you can pick this thing up and peel the top off so this one's actually pretty easy sometimes you're going to struggle with them a bit and you can always use your knife to kind of clean up the last little bits but now we push all this down we've got this beautiful presentation but we've got a problem it doesn't want to stand upright so we're going to flatten off the bottom take our knife and cut it straight so that it stands upright perfectly and then we're going to do that 11 more times so now that we've got those trimmed up we're going to start in on the flavoring process and we're going to start with a brine today one of the great things about a little piece of meat like this is it can brine pretty quickly 45 minutes to an hour and it's taken on the flavor of that brine and soaked up some of that juiciness so that you have an end product that is much more juicy today we're doing a very basic brine it's the cattleman's grill butcher house brine it's just all the basic stuff you need in a really solid brine salt sugar it's got garlic and onion and those flavors are going to be imparted into the meat in the time that it soaks so that's where we're jumping off from let's go ahead and mix this brine up and get the drumsticks in there so we're gonna start with three quarts of water should be plenty to submerge our actually baker's dozen of these lollipops and then for every quart of water you need about six tablespoons of the butcher house brine so we're gonna go one cup and two tablespoons and that'll leave us enough of this brine to do a couple more quarts for another project no need to warm this up we're just going to whisk until it starts to dissolve so i usually just go about 60 seconds and then i'll feel in there if i can feel any grit i'll keep going but it's completely dissolved so at this point chicken goes in the brine and you could actually trim these after you brine them if you want to i've done it both ways i don't feel there's an advantage so i just go ahead and trim them up front that way you actually get that brine accessing the meat through the top get that plate in place and lock it in we throw that in the fridge for 45 minutes to an hour so today we're going to be cooking on the yoder smokers ys640s pellet grill and i don't normally show you guys the pellets that we're cooking with but i'm excited because we got a new mix from barbecuers delight they're calling the contest mix now all of barbecuer's delight pellets are oak based with a flavor wood added to them they're all 100 wood so you're cooking with wood they use that oak so that you get a consistent btu a consistent burning rate out of the pellets but this one actually blends together cherry and pecan two of our favorite pellets that we like to mix anyway you get it all in one bag so we're gonna go with those for our barbecue today so we'll fire it up we're going to be cooking at 325 a roasting temperature today to make sure that we get a really nice bite through skin on our chicken all right so the chicken's had time to brighten out we're going to pull it out get it seasoned up and onto the grill all right so we're gonna get the excess moisture off of these as they come out i do maybe prefer as i think about it more doing the trimming on these ahead of time before the brine just because it's nice to be able to just pull these out season them up and get them on and you're not messing with wet chicken trying to trim that up and get it into shape so now we're going to get these seasoned up we're using the oak ridge bbq dominant dominator sweet rib rub it's a great barbecue rub with some kind of unique flavors in it it's got your normal stuff of course salt sugar garlic black pepper but it's also got like four different chilies in it it has some coriander and some vietnamese cinnamon that are really interesting flavor notes and those are actually going to work really well with this glaze we're going to put together for the chicken for dipping a little bit later but we'll get to that you actually kind of don't have to season the bottom too much because the stuff that's fallen off we'll just kind of soak that up there at the end let's be smart about this right we're learning all right so get the bottom seasoned up here and honestly these are ready to go on pretty much immediately like once you see some moisture on the surface we know that that rub is really attached to the meat or the skin in this case and that tells us that they're ready to cook look at that we didn't waste any all right so we're just going to stand these up right on the second shelf we're cooking indirect heat again 325 a roasting temperature because we want our skin to cook through we don't want rubbery skin and then once we get these loaded up here we're going to be ready to just let them go for quite a while i would expect we don't have anything to do for about 45 minutes to an hour when that internal temperature gets a little bit closer to done well guys we're about 40 minutes into the cook now we're gonna mix up our sauce glaze combo whatever you want to call that and we want to warm it up we don't want it to be cold room temperatures okay but warm is ideal so that we can dip our lollipops into that sauce and then put them back on all right so we're going to start off with a base of firebug mild grilling sauce and i'm going to put about half of this bottle in here so that's going to be about one cup so this is a great grilling sauce barbecue sauce with fruity flavors into it we also want to add a couple tablespoons of pineapple juice so this kind of thins things out but it's got that great pineapple flavor which goes well with barbecue we're going to add one tablespoon of honey and this is kind of for the sheen we want it to shine a little bit and then here's where we're going to take a little detour from the normal we're going to add a couple tablespoons of curry paste so this might sound kind of crazy but curry barbecue sauce is delicious incredible depth of flavor you're getting all kinds of umami out of it people won't know what hit them we want to add just enough of this curry paste that you notice something is different but it's not taking over everything so we'll give this a whisk we're going to throw it on the grill and then here in a few minutes we can start dipping and glazing our lollipops right there over the firebox you got some great color going skins rendering away which is great we're sitting at about say 155 we want to really want to get these glazed around 160 and finish them around 170 175 when it comes to the dark meat of the chicken we want to finish it differently than we do the white meat so whereas a chicken breast might finish at like 160 155 160 and let that carry over cooking bring it up to 165. that's a juicy finishing for a white meat but when it comes to the dark meat it needs a little bit higher temperature to really break down that extra fat and connective tissue that's in the darker meat because once it gets to like that 170 175 range it's just like velvet great texture all right so let's take a look here see our sauce it's moving a bit it's loosened up because it's warm got a nice shine to it now from that honey and the pineapple juice so here's what we're going to do we're going to pour this off into a jar i find this to be the easiest way to go about glazing oh man i just caught a whiff of that that curry and barbecue combo smells awesome so check this out i'm going to come right back up here to our lollipops one by one dunk them shake off that excess and then back onto the grill for the sauce to tack up we're just going to go all the way through all these get them all dumped man just smelling smoke barbecue sauce curry i don't know why we don't put these things together more often all right last one these aren't going to take long now again like i said we're going to go for like 170 on finishing internal let's close up the lid and let that sauce tack up all right guys well we're temping in the sweet spot on all of these lollipops now so we're going to start to pull these off you can see how that sauce is really tacked up on the outside nice and sticky on the surface from the heat all right let's have a bite got curry barbecue sauce it's got some incredible depth of flavor not something you taste all the time and if it's not for you it's not for you but i'd say give it a shot now the chicken is just extremely juicy and we've cooked it now until it just about falls off this thing but thanks to that brine it's juicy down to its core great flavor i mean that's a fun little barbecue dish and these things are going to be a hit someday when we can get together and have some parties right throw a plate of those out grab it by the handle y'all got a good time we'll see you later thank you guys so much for watching be sure to check out atbbq.com for all the products

i'm not going to load into the game here mainly because i'm very tired when i'm running this running recording this but i'm going to show you how to get lollipops in atom crossing horizons so i was able to record me getting one i should be able to find it here i believe uh but anyway with lollipops it works the same as with candies making sure you have a lot is um ideal and when you give a villager a piece of candy on halloween night so october 31st past nine o'clock there's a chance that they will give you a lollipop which you can then give to jack who exchanges it for an important item so here you can see i'm giving judy a piece of candy and it gives me a lollipop in return which i then took check i'm gonna just load into the game quickly to actually show you guys what i got just give me two seconds while that happens but yeah it's um it's pretty straightforward it seems to have a bit of randomness to it as well but making sure you have multiple pieces of candy for the night is always a good idea by looks of it so i'm just going to load it now just taking a little bit longer so the thing that jack gives you for giving him a piece of candy is [Music] a pumpkin carrot because that's what he's giving me hold on really how big is this one it is literally just the giant pumpkin carriage yeah there you go that's that's the video i'm pretty happy with this",

for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed draft regulations Health Canada says cannabis products will be permitted for legal sale no later than October 17 2019", "tuax4BoYEiY": "hello today today that Charlie riches her life today is the day that Sally eat strawberry wise up and

How? How to pronouce this? Where is the clip? This gonna be tongue twisting Hello everyone Welcome back to another gunpla review I'm Dadee, and today I'm going to look at the Seravee Gundam Scheherazade? My first impression about this kit is fat, It's really fat This can be explained by Scheheraz.... Damn it I can't pronounce his name, so from now on, let's use Seravee instead This can be explained by Seravee's high firepower So it needs a big body to carry the guns and withstand the recoils when firing those ranged weapons And after looking it for a while, I started to like the new design The head, which is redesigned, looks cooler than it's original head I also accosiated the middle eastern traditional clothes with those big arms and legs And guess what? The first place where our Diver team met the builder of this Gundam: Shahryar is Perissia I think it's a kind of wordplay for Persia This kit also has a good color separation You have total of 6 colors yellowish white, light blue, grey, red, yellow And the icy white on the top of the Ptolemaios' guns The colors and the new design make your gunpla look like a rich and noble man who comes from Middle East However, one thing which I don't like about this kit is the use of big stickers Like the yellow part on the v-fin the front section of the Ptolemaios arm and this part of the leg should be grey but these are minors, and you can paint it easily Next is the articulation I was really suprised with how good this kit can move around For a gundam with such a bulky design, this is one of its pros Head can look up this far, pretty good and look down this far It can go all the way around Shoulders move out 360 spin Arms go up, double joints at the elbow Wrist can go up and down, and a ball joint here The waist can move forward and backward right and left it can also do a 360 spin No movement at the front and the back skirt the side skirt can go up and down slightly As for the hip joints, those are the old style ball and socket joint so you can not really move at all and can not do the split the thigh is solid so you can only slightly move it Here's the kick to the front, as you can see, it's blocked right here you can move the leg down a little bit to get a higher kick here is the kick to the back double joints at the knee The ankle can move up and down side to side and finally this can fold up Next is the accessories, and this is Seravee Gundam with everything that comes with As you can see, it only has one pair of holding hands For the weapon, you have one GN bazooka yeah, this is a bazooka You can take this part out the handle can move out To hold the gun, you slide it into the hand spin it then clip this section onto the arm done And then we have the Ptolemaios Arms Inspired by the Celestial Being's battle ship from Mobile Suit Gundam 00 This one is sold seperately so if you buy the Seravee Gundam, you have yourself a good deal And the ship can combine with the gundam to become Jinn mode or Efreet mode But first, this thing can transform to a big gun, by popping the mount open pull the handle at the back out like this Then you have yourself GN Ptolemy Cannon with a special move which is What? Are you laughing? can't help myself, sorry you guys And to transform to the Jinn mode, this ship halves in the middle section this section pops in to the back skirt and drop down For the front section, you take out the two bottom guns connect it into the side skirts Swing the top guns down Pop it to the back of Seravee And then you have Seravee Gundam: Jinn mode specialized for long ranged combat You can also take out the top guns Change the small connector into the bigger one so the top guns can point out over the shoulder like this To transform to the Efreet mode, you take out those part on the waist and those parts at the back Pop out the fins spin it around open it then connect it to the feet close the feet finish For the upper section, you split it in half take out the handle pop the handle into the adapter the back section split open put them into the adapter then connect it to the front section finally pop the fins in Then you have GN Claw This is the Efreet mode which is specialized in close-range combat As I mentioned, the ptolemaios arms is sold separately So you can connect it to others HGs for example: HG 00 Diver pretty cool That is it for the review I'm kind of pleased with what Seravee Gundam has brought me Good color separation, nice articulation and a weapon pack is included And if you are a fan of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 This kit right here maybe is for you Ptolemaios Arms is pretty cute And that's my opinions, what about yours? comment to let me know I'm Dadee and once again, thank you very much for spending time watching my video clip Leave a like if you do and don't forget to comeback for more gunpla review See you next time!

lyrica okay Vanunu please log on to www.hsn.com", "hqSvf2Typw8": "- Hi everybody, I'm so happy\nthat you joined me today. I'm going to teach you how to make a very simple cannabis tincture. So I'm gonna move my camera down below so that you can see everything that you'll need, and I'll walk you through the process. All right. So to make a tincture, the first thing that you're gonna need\nobviously is cannabis. I keep my cannabis in a glass mason jar because it keeps it fresh. I am going to weigh out 14\ngrams of cannabis on my scale. The reason is is that I decarb my cannabis in this awesome machine. I'm gonna talk about it in a second, and that machine only takes 14 grams. If you're gonna do your\ndecarbing in the oven, you can decarb as much as you want. I have 14 grams here. Decarbing is the process\nof taking the cannabis and heating it up to a certain temperature so that the molecules THC-A and CBD-A, if you have CBD in your\nplant, turn into THC and CDB. So they need to be activated or heated up in order to turn into the\ncompounds that we're looking for. And like I said, I do this in this handy\nlittle machine which I love, and if you make lots\nof cannabis creations, I definitely suggest\nthat you get one as well. It's called a Nova, and\nit's by the company Ardent which is woman-run company which I love. And all you do is you\nput in up to 14 grams and literally hit this\nbutton, and it turns red. In about an hour and a\nhalf, it'll turn green and I'll know that my\ncannabis is decarbed. The number one reason why I bought this is that if you decide\nto decarb in the oven which is a very simply process as well, you just keep your\ncannabis in your glass jar, take the label off, put it in the oven at about 240 degrees\nFahrenheit for 40 minutes, and when it comes out it'll be\na little bit dry and crispy. Again, we do this to activate it, so you must do this\nbefore you make a tincture or basically any edible. When you decarb in the oven, you can lose up to 30% of the compounds, and you don't wanna do that\n'cause cannabis is expensive. So this little machine pays for itself really quickly if you\nmake lots of infusions. The thing you're gonna do next is grind up your decarbed cannabis, so this is some stuff that I did earlier, and it's dry and crispy, and\nit smells a little bit toasty, and you're gonna grind it up. I bought a coffee grinder\njust for this purpose. You don't have to do that, you can just cut it up\nwith scissors if you want. You're not looking to have it pulverized, you're just looking to\nbreak up the surface area so that the alcohol can strip off more of those precious\ngoodies that we want. So this one that we have\nis called Zombie Kush. I always recommend\nreally labeling your jars with as much information as you can. How much cannabis you put in there, how much alcohol you put in there, what kind of alcohol you put in there. Fill that green piece of tape up with everything that you\ncan, it's easy to forget. So this one I am going to do in vodka. You have lots of options, you can basically use any clear alcohol. If you're in the states, they tell you to use Everclear\nwhich is really high alcohol, really high proof alcohol. And we don't have access\nto that here in Canada, but I'm gonna post a link\ndown below for anybody who has a medical prescription. There is a way, at least in\nOntario, to write to the LCBO and tell that that you would\nlike higher-proof alcohol to do your tinctures with, and then you can go ahead\nand buy that at the LCBO. So I've got my alcohol in\nhere and my decarbed cannabis. You're gonna shake it a lot, and you put this little\npuppy in your cupboard and let it sit there for a long\ntime, the longer the better. You can see that I have\nquite a bit of liquid in here for how much cannabis I have. I maybe shouldn't have poured\nin a half a cut right away. I should've checked it. The thing with making your own creations is that you never really have\na great idea what's in it, so you always have to\ntest the product anyway, you start low and go slow\neven with your own products. But if you want a more potent tincture, put in less alcohol so that there's more cannabis and less alcohol. And yeah, you let this\nsit in your cupboard. Some people leave it a week,\nsome people leave it month. Some people leave it a year, it just gets more potent\nup to a certain point the longer you leave it. And you can add in more cannabis\nas you get it if you like. You can make this a\nreally dynamic process. So the other trick that lots\nof people don't know about and I love telling them about is that if you use a\nvaporizer to user your canna-- To smoke, instead of smoking cannabis, I ask that save all the stuff that you... All your kind of spent\nremains that are in here, save them because even though\nyou've already used them when you used it in the vaporizer, this stuff is still potent. It's not as potent as fresh cannabis, but it still packs a wallop. So this is called ABV oil which stands for already been vaped. Sorry, it's not oil, I'm gonna make a\ntincture, an ABV tincture. And you can see I didn't measure this, so I am literally just\ngonna pour this on top. This one is moonshine which had a pretty high alcohol\ncontent, but it tastes awful. So I'm just trying to use up\nthe rest of it to be honest. Yeah, so that's not enough, so I'm gonna add in some vodka here. It's just a tincture however it works out. Basically, what you're trying\nto do is to get the good stuff off the cannabis and into the alcohol. So again, you shake the\nheck out of your tincture, and then you're gonna\nstore this in the cupboard. So this is called a cupboard tincture. There's a bunch of other\nways to do the tinctures, but this is called the cupboard tincture. When you are ready, and you can test this every couple of days or every week by just\ntaking a little spoon of it, and putting it in some\njuice, and drinking it. You should notice the\neffects if you drink it, let's say within 20 minutes\nup to an hour and a half. I know that's a really big range, but gosh, cannabis is hard\nto really narrow down. So once it's at the\nright strength for you, all you do is you take a strainer and put some cheese cloth in it, and you pour this\nconcoction into the strainer and let it drain into a jar. And then you have a\ntincture that you can just-- You can take it in a little,\nsmall tincture bottle with you, it's really discreet, you\ncan drop it into beverages. Some people can handle it\nunderneath their tongue, I cannot. Yeah, so it's a really great way to ingest cannabis without smoking it. The other things that\nyou can do with tinctures is you can turn them into gummies. That's how people make cannabis gummies is they use a tincture base. You can boil off some of the alcohol when you're done making the tincture so that it's like a\nreally thick goo almost. You can infuse that into honey, so just to melt it into some honey. And you can use that and just\nswish it around in your mouth so that you get the benefits\nof how quickly it'll go into your system in your mouth, but you don't have to\nhow terrible it tastes with the alcohol, the honey\nreally helps with that. So starting with a really\nbasic cupboard tincture can be a really fun,\neasy way to get into it. If you have any questions,\nplease let me know. I'm gonna link to all the instructions for you to do this down below, so don't worry, you don't\nhave to write anything down which maybe I should've\nabout before but whatever. I do hope that you enjoyed it. If you did, please give\nme a thumbs up on YouTube and write me a comment, it helps, so that other people can find me. And if you are looking\nto improve your life and you'd like to start using cannabis, but you don't know how and you'd like somebody to hold your hand, then reach out on my website which is www.revealcannabis.com. I have a cannabis consultation there. It's 150 Canadian dollars, and I walk you through the\nprocess, and hold your hand, and help you learn how to use this beautiful plant medicine for health. Until then, I will see you next week.", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "TxNRCyaqkEE": "pop my chocolate him my mom yeah here we go first part alright everybody yeah you see me popping a chocolate in my

everything you just referred to I gotta get this to Sami I don't have a single sesame flavor and I want to get that truffle I don't understand learn more Sunday I understand you know you get some good flavors over that we don't have them here what am I supposed to do I didn't even know why that's Asami till you told me you need to all stacks personal that's Sven that just means Rogers noisier than me you asking for a smoked salmon flavor he's got it right in the pocket yeah I don't care about the brand he can I don't care about the producer I want the flavor I want and then I search for it so I don't Kim Hindi Emma you're gonna put salmon rapture and stuff gonna taste like crap I wanna make a mix video salmon and thank you something I can take can taste it's one no I don't think it's gonna be okay well he's blastula pirate leather shoe we can get a give him credit out bad and pupil don't say it negative in him and I also when I tested it yeah yeah for their fault they find the little banknotes in in the in the drink year especially in drink mixes a little back note of this leather it's in fact superb as I say never begin to say it's it's a leather tone and everything another votes yeah so label in Germany and that guy is known for earthy flavors leathery flavors okay pairs them with Woodruff or chocolate or creams or whatever it's they're really the same thing in my user use of truffle - that's what's a one-er tea flavor that also gives a special note of it so yeah it's just us Putin is stuck in this normal square books get out of it and have some fun ya know lost lost order with sauce on me I bought free beer flavor flavor of beer and the rest was just floral flavor yeah it's fun it's nice like candy be super mixes so why not don't be afraid me here Roger Roger and the beer mixes cooling like no I'm not used used to be cooling yet because I'm not what you say I haven't haven't least a lot to eat beer yet and I have to try to find out how it could function I'm not I'm a bit unsure if you're gonna go with cooling or not because the cooling ain't right you know it won't be quite similar as a as a chilled beer you're gonna you're gonna get this whatever if use in Colorado or you're using via stunt it's free or whatever it is you get the cooling and all of the way so you won't be totally similar yeah so I'm not sure if it fits correctly read yet but I gonna try at least we have checked out some more Saudis flavors here and and taste tested in I guess beer and I are quite Atlantic in fact it is but yeah that's that's a problem with it but also I normally wait a bit a bit cooler flavoring I don't want a want a hooked wave yeah no I'm saying but okay as this one of my mixes know why I made it say is pancakes will be the bit barren that's superb their it function very very good that's right well yeah I could see that working to it a little bit of maple in there and everything oh yeah it sounds really it's rather good maple in its why swine with noodles laughs it's great here in the group we're gonna do this giveaway in a couple minutes probably about 15 minutes you have to be in the group yeah be live to claim it I got to put a keyword up you just put the keyword in the chat and then I'm gonna run the bot in the battle pick a random comment that use that keyword and and then that person gets a $25 gift certificate from our sponsor real flavours from Walt great guy and also though every winner from every week every quarter of the year we do a 250 dollar gift certificate just for those winners I got 10 winners so far this is gonna be the 11th Sunday will be the 12th and the next following week will we'll do the giveaway for the two hundred and fifty dollar gift certificates so you guys want to get in here hope youse win hope you get a chance to get at the big price now like I said you got two more chances today in Sunday and then we'll do the 250 and then we start all over again yeah with the $25.00 each week until we get to the next quarter so we'll do that shortly right now we're just gonna ramble on if anybody in the group here and the Chad has any questions any ideas for us to talk about newer mixing for the for the newer people because I know there's a lot of people in here or already pretty experienced but the new word people really see this video later on in the future maybe it can help them so let's start up with vote we'll start off with use has been equipment what would you say for the newer person just to start mixing what do they need cheap and easy I wouldn't I wouldn't get all that fancy tech stuff that you can buy now like like sewers and I actually started mixing with syringes I I didn't go for this game and stuff I just got me a syringe and just tried it fixed up some flavors I I totally agree I started with syringes and my and my theory on that is these people they start mixing they're not sure if it's gonna be what they want to do you know what I meant it might not be their cup of tea after what so so why invest all that kind of money when you can just mix with a couple cinders or syringes in a bottle or even mix in a coffee cup but don't really matter you know what I mean then pour it in and afterwards you don't need a whole lot very simple very simple actually I it's it's very tempting if you see recipes out there like Rogers or other recipes on LR or all the flavors and stuff like that they use like six eight whatever twelve different flavorings and I didn't even know anything when I started I didn't even know somebody would actually do that I mean I wanted a pineapple Kiwi I got pineapple and keyd and tried it out and that's what but I would suggest to beginners to to here's a very very good question in that in the chat you wanna you want to handle it Roger how much does pg/vg ratio affect flavor a lot do I need to say more you get so short winded if you taste taste different one you're gonna find it very very fast you're gonna find out it's big difference if you use a 50/50 or a 70/30 P DVD and a VGA PD you wanna find it very very easy the fault it calms down the more VG you use but also the flavoring is a bit more calm many things when you are using higher amount o VG you need more flavor that's wrong you need more steeping every flavor is have a window where it's best so in some percentage they are not different of course but when you go out of this window it gonna change whatever not every flavor is going to be okay in VG because VG is ain't a good the flavor carrier PG is a lot better so we're gonna get some change this whatever and it got a big more calm around the taste when the more VG you get but you need to use more steeping personally I found out if I make a use approximately around as 67 to 72 percent VG there I I find a certain change in the taste and under this this percentage then it's functioning quite normal as a 60 40 or 50 50 in a way but there comes over this point then it suddenly comes down a bit more and that you can't reach whatever ever if if you if you steep whatever long you want it not help it gonna be more more calm down the taste of it but and some flavor you can't get good in high VG either that's another thing but it it's a as in all rest of Mei Dai it's a lot of variations to get and you can't not not yeah I can say approximately none is written in stone every everything is going to be changed as long as the mixes a bit changed or not similar and always say she's not possible to say it concrete how it is in whatever thing but PG and we do have a lot to say in taste and also your feeling of of the weight of course yeah that the throw is I remember when I started I was Bateman 50/50 backhoe no clearomizer and I just kept getting like a horse stroke and I'd kept saying duh this is gonna be mild Anna and I really didn't know a whole lot about you know mixing back then and I said well let me try a different different to ratio and I went from fifty fifty to sixty forty and that was back to hell I was buying it from Mount Baker vapor I think I was at the time flavor west flavoring yeah exactly oh and I got this 6014 Isis oh my god this is a so much creamier you know it's like a my throat it was so much nicer you know I was never a cloud chaser I hate there was one time that you know I was it was a gimmick you know I was even putting straight VG and my stinking stuff is you know as much as I could that Airwick just to see the clouds but I was never a big cloud chaser and I was always wanted the flavor but it does get a little bit creamier and you know a little bit to put the less drought-hit for you so but I can also tell I had had pupil who has reviewed my my juices we believe there was 60% ve G and it wasn't it was 60 blood GG yeah man man man here because yeah the mix was so yeah for once so perfect they didn't feel the difference and that's in fact in a lot of the mixes you don't wanna feel this difference in 10% difference in vidi-vidi if it's gonna be correct but then it need to be stupid whatever yeah see it's the same thing as as I say about this multi cream you you talked about if if if you taste it off the three four weeks you're gonna get some short notes of something let it stay for months then you're gonna get the whole on order testing of it then it gonna be a morph rounder similar whatever tastes yeah and the same thing is with with VD too it's the same thing you're gonna lose a lot of these sharp edges and you got to get around the fueler taste on it it's the same thing and then of course then they also gonna ruin some of these edges on some flavorings so in the Australian or mulatto mixer should have said before that was doing more like hi DVD or one represent maybe at least try as much as possible I've gone back to 60 the AVG or some in fact down to 52 just for the taste yeah so well I'm gonna have you boys complain and I my stream health is good here everything's good we're talking good this YouTube a my site is good here excellent stream health but everybody's getting bounced around here for some reason so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna throw up this this giveaway the keyword for the giveaway and let's some people get it summoned now will try and get it away up pretty quick here in case something happens it's screwy and we lose it so the keyword for today is special type special in the chat in here and then we'll go one or two rounds on and make sure everybody gets in and we'll have the bot picket the reason word special is because this is a special make up show for us for Sunday and Roger Dean wears makeup either what the hell come on graduate lipstick no [ __ ] way [Laughter] my image is reversed the hell's that supposed to mean my image is reversed let me see if I can do something to that oh yeah does it matter that's why I D in the back of you oh really oh not on my computer but yeah video enable mirror effect yeah okay there we go turn that off I should be good now I would think yeah let's say you are blushing about lipstick so here's Paula she's someone that yelled at me about missing my show could be the keyword for next next show well I should be straight now I think hmm hold up my left hand is my left hand look at me look at this this is still from the IV look at that it's terrible I have a quick question Roger do you do you think if you use 6040 for 80/20 that there's a large amount more sweetness in the juice do you actually taste yeah it's gonna be changes but large ah some at least I can feel it I feel the change it because sometimes I can use you used to PG a Lydia just the sweetness in the in the videos but yeah it's it's easy for me Mira has been mixing it and tasting like this thing in yeah over four and a half year but for a newcomer they yeah it's a lot lot of this old stuff from the from the smoking I don't have however all their yeah they are not all senses are developed back to normal again so this is in here I'm sorry a Festivus in here I think he didn't hear me say about the word we had a keyword everybody has to put in the chat here and the word is special and if you do that we're gonna run about and you have a chance of winning a $25 gift certificate from real flavors and you guys spell it the right way to answer jack we need to test what ratio do you use I normally run in about 70/30 when I do my tests that's basically what I've ate most of the time that's I I mix for myself I when I do my reviews and stuff like that it's just my opinion I'm not saying that it's you know written in stone I'm just trying to tell everybody the way I feel you know if you disagree with me that's great you know what I mean everybody's different but I mix for me and so I mix for myself and that's the way I test i test for myself so special right don't frighten special normally I also you mix a lot in in 30 70 but sometimes I feel it's better in 34 565 it depends on on the mix only if I hit eat this yeah well yes as I said before we're really flavour are changing a bit too much for me at least like you secretly depend on a flavoring you know what I mean the type of flavor find a lotta mixers I found out approximate a bit between these 66 67 to 72 percentage VGA somewhere over this I get a little extra space that be in the taste and then I don't want it to then have to find out it's it's going to be like that I need to purge it a bit under so what not everybody believed me but at least I feel it so interesting yeah I'm not a for I said anybody else got any other questions for is here let's see what base-jumped me says here I have to do 80/20 I have no choice 20% peaches most I can have yeah well it's a lot of people PG and tolerant to that so I'm fortunate doesn't cry secrecy it says I found a lot of use is too sweet yeah think I think about it use 80 percentage with the VG and then you perhaps few teens on amo sweetener to of course you're gonna be sweet VG is is a used as a sweetener in in food right so it's understandable and and I can also say when I see her when I see a tobacco pipe if that's in high video I don't understand it it's it won't it won't be any any tobacco maybe but but I'm also a RI for it makes 802 back away from me that's a caramel you mix with a faint tobacco notes not not at the back away so you know we had some questions porn in here one say it to summer camp like mixes that are okay but just great when mixed together and how to marry in one recipe versus just mixing separate mixes and then mixing that I do that all the time I I'll take a mix in its in my tank this is a you know I came up with some really good mixes this way I'll have a tank and it gets halfway down and either out of laziness or just me wondering experiment I'll take that half a tank and I'll put a different juice in there I'll shake it up as good as I can and then in L vape on it and it comes out good and the easiest way to to do that is well Roger uses the same program I do one on the PC there's a great program called juice calculator it's DIY e juice you later calm or DIY juice calculator calm and something yeah it's got that function right in it you can set the ratio that you want the 50/50 60/40 70/30 whatever you I balled that you think it was and try it and it works great I do then all the time but we're gonna no one here but it's nothing wrong with mixing it in a tank or mixing in a bottle it doesn't matter the point is the point is anyway way to try to test out what is good or not hey you don't know try so yeah that's one of the finger is with money I get trouble with in in di because they're bit afraid this is not gonna be okay or something it's nothing is wrong it's nothing really it's the one all the way to find out what is okay for you is to try whatever and I I've dumped a lot of mixtures we've gone straight to down the drain so it is just try that's the main point of everything so I hear my stream is certain act appear now to a little bit it's like in the caution zone raven asked should I just lost it Raven ass and this is our mark yeah about the picture and I don't like vaping pits so maybe you guys can answer it I'm not sure about it I need to check about what what home my notes are on this this from from cap but normally you're never gonna get it as bad as good as if you are using more juicy peach more peach flavors and layer it then you're gonna get it even stronger without getting out of the best flavor of each flavor you can take one flavor and use it to 10% it's okay you you step it up to 12 and it go on gone down the drain to fit use another one use one that eight used or the one not five and suddenly you have 13 presents total and it's gonna be higher exactly on that type flavor right but that's the only way to get it really strong but but also we have if you're gonna go and taste on a peach and and with your tongue and everything you're not gonna get the similar taste strength in weight whatever you do that's one one or the main thing I found out a lot of people don't understand you caught you you can't get the same strength for it you can get a bit similarity but not totally so the peach flavor always gets harsh if it gets too hard get they gonna get harsh what normal but another saying yeah layer layer it with more peach flavors Danny I'm gonna reach a higher notable did Steve let it steep peach flavor two weeks is minimum whatever you do let it stand in at least two weeks yeah in a crazy crazy a so it's better to do 50/50 for his mixes there no I don't think so maybe Roger of contradict me Annette but they like you like grad you're saying all the the more PG in the mix it's better flavor carrier but that's gonna be harsh and correct most people aren't used to vaping that way you know most Starbucks bought mixes and I know you're fairly nor mixer they're normally running 70/30 8020 when you buy them in a store now it's not like the old days with the old clearomizer so we were again 50/50 mixes sixty-forty maybe if you want to try it and then just go up from there what you're testing that might be a good or like Roger said 75 Thor what are you doing 65 35 to 70 yeah 65 destroy it nobody can say what water is correct for you or not just try it and see what yourself feel about it if it fits you then it's superb if not try it try to change a bit then and check it out it's the only way to do it for me I I consider and weigh 50 PG without problem but it isn't sure it fit everyone so and Thank You Philly bill polices he loves this group it's like the family we try and keep it that way we try to keep everybody just like one guy you know Rogers your crazy uncle how do you believe Malloy just going in the street in the table nine cameras over there I can't I don't know what's going on there Paula as far as the video goes but I it's gonna we're just gonna have to live with it for this week maybe I can make some other adjustments maybe for next week's show lower summer some of the bandwidth on it but I can't do it midstream so let's one more time if you didn't already do it because I see we got more people in the group not so special is the keyword put special down in the chat write it down in the chat here and it sounds like we go through this last round I'm gonna run it run the bots and and we'll see how it goes see who the big winner is a $25 gift certificate from real flavours our sponsor and chance to win $250 gift certificate which has come up in a couple weeks so and that's only for the winners of the past 12 weeks and we only were on week 11 so we got this week next week and then we'll run the big grand prize for this quarter pick me pick me nice thing about the real flavours to Rogers he started doing it in smaller you know smaller quantities yeah yes superb and it's easy for people to buy yeah minor amount and test it out before they find out if they what I won't tell what I like and yeah yeah it's pretty clear I think he's going down as first well I think it's 30 mils the smallest I'm not positive no oh I think it's tumbled so he'll know okay good oh that's good that's good that's even better everybody should should buy small till they know what the hell they like I don't care if there's a thousand people say this is great you might be the one in a thousand that don't like you I never bought the flavor in bigger and bigger amounts before I've tested it out yeah everyone is put in maximum 10 mils and checked out if I like it and I see this isn't flavor I gonna be using not buy bigger if not never and if it cost a bit more para Mills but and so right the the thing you need to throw because it's get too old that's also cost so it does matter yeah they say well we didn't have the $250 give away you're mistaken and for the five hundred and fifty dollar giveaway that we had in the group that was $350 worth of content and a $250 in cash this is different this is a different innovate we didn't pick we're gonna pick right now last chance for everybody say special right special in the chat and I'm gonna do it in the next like minute here and we'll see who our winner for this week is so I'm not give it another second here and then we will run it as soon as I find it how do you see I'm raping in Germany when is it is it rising societies or or is it coming a bit down not after this relation must come no it's got a lot more its goes up the TPD regulations were pretty pretty tough hmm restrictions on on nicotine and all that kind of stuff but for me when I go through the city and look around you talked about this before you see people everywhere maybe yeah women sitting in cafes with the little you know pod systems or small mods and tank systems vaping away you know and then I mentioned before like I started vaping actually while I started like seven years ago but kinda had a fall back into smoking and then restarted two and a half or two years ago and when I started vaping again and not a tank and and all that kind of stuff and you get out of your car in the parking lot and you start vaping and you know blowing up a cloud people were looking at you like you're crazy you have cars on the fire that that doesn't happen anymore it's accepted in society and then a lot of people that are still smoking even an older age is like I don't know like 60 or something like that they're they're coming over they're interested in their ass mind if I try and I like it I like that it's not the outside crowded oh yeah it's okay I'll tell you I did a poll in our group a while back I saw the stats on it but the average paper was if I remember right was like between the age of 35 and 55 was the average where the most people were you know what I mean it was surprising to see there's a lot of you know you would think that this is like a you know a teen or twenty type deal but there's a lot of you know mid-range people there in that 35 to 55 range that uh that baby and there is a surprising amount of older people to you know 65 plus that it's the old smoker who started to wave mostly yeah it's I had talked with a guy from the u.s. earlier on Monday actually that was after the biggest vape Expo on last weekend went on in Germany and there was a video going around the internet Facebook and stuff they had 20,000 visitors on the weekend and for a country like Germany that's a whole lot of any that like even Vegas or something like that where you have big bait shows you don't have 20,000 yeah all right I'm gonna run this I'm gonna run this right now we're gonna get the bat out here we're gonna

just shy of it and we're like family in there really good net because it's mine or anything but it's a great group we got good people like Sven here and Roger everybody here in the chat we got some really really nice people it's also one of the most international groups in di I think like I see in the invest Bob yeah yeah we go it is we catered everybody we don't care where you come from yep so it's a suggestion for new mixers to just join any things group or stuff like that I mean I learned so much through through the University group and other forums and stuff like that just get in there I mean people it stay one of the best ways to get it where can you get info whoo-hoo a where can you ask Fink's and and get on servers you don't you don't find it in in in some books you don't find it in some schools you need to go out in in in these communities and ask that's the easiest way to do it okay and just just don't be afraid no point nobody bites or if they avoid it doesn't matter it's just on the screen just love for that it doesn't matter so I think I think I am checking on on a group for him yeah when I started already and then that time too he was very polite and yeah also everyone that's that's the main point of everything that the people who have something to learn to learn away they they are ready to share stuff and yeah that's what makes us our grow so special and I pointed out the people and I will not tolerate people abuse and other mixers you know you get some people out there they they forget their roots they forget where the hell they came from correct and and they just totally forget and all of a sudden they think well I did the work you have to - well I did a hell of a lot more work than a lot of people because I didn't have any of this information out there before you know the best I had was nothin what's an ECR for me cigarettes for secret ECF I'm a BCE cigarette worm that was the best I had and it was only a handful of people on there - and you know I did a lot of hard work I don't want a lot of testing but why the help just because I did it why the hell this do does everybody have to do it you know what I mean the whole goal here is to get people they've been and get them up the smokes it's not that you have to put work into it you know they're doing their work they're making their own stuff but they don't have to scour the internet for hours and hours and hours if there's people like us that it can hand them this stuff easily the goal is to get away to quit smoking and that that's a way I look at it at least you know yeah it's the main goal whatever and everybody have fun mixing right exactly that's that's the other thing I want is someone I don't want it to be dull and boring either I want people have fun and wanted people to joke around kid around because you get bored and the people leave groups look for that you know it's the same thing every day every day no well at least not mine I'm trying to do I want it to be family I want people to laugh and joke and kid around you know try and keep your conference in your concentration on the vaping stuff but if you you get sidelined ain't it like we do here and the videos all the time you know suicide track [Laughter] you know I don't want to see in a job I wanna I want to have fun and enjoy people so and it's a great up early correct just as we do today with lose you smell or home friends different culture but yeah that you yeah I I don't know it's like I said our whole goal is to get people mixing get people vaping and the way the prices are and everything anymore and no regulations and everything it's getting scary for people and that's the other thing you know like I said we were talking about trying to do gets into what they're people a lot of people don't have money a lot of people are mixing because they don't have the money to go spend $30 for a 30 milk bottle of juice you know especially with the equipment today so you they don't have much other option but to make for themselves oh that to commercial juices you don't know what's in there might taste good but you don't know what your baby exactly yeah flavorings I just saw today all in berry flavors has they have like no diacetyl no no situate and all that kind of stuff advertising on their website and if there's really nothing like that in their flavorings that would be a good way to start and I'm pretty sure how they're ending marcelina from Owen Barry's really good people told she's she's a sweetheart and super beautiful yeah I Nora were both from them when I started out it was it's superb they are great people like I don't know what I could say about she has some damn good flavors too I gotta admit that I am still in love with that Camello oh my god it's so good oh I'm sorry the whiskey it the gid ejected and sold on the unwiped I don't have it I don't have their JD what did you get that I got a ton I got she stole it this is just one little pile right here you know and I get this behind me I can't but we need to just start vaping you know yeah you know but she's good she's got some good flavor so I gotta admit that why that's mostly begged by um Kim nomadic yes that's our broth works oh it's really it is I didn't know that I met him in Birmingham lasted I know they got some damn good nicotine tool because I had a sample of their nicotine I was pretty damn good at least what I had you know yeah really good reputation I'm not sure about I think liter or something was their smallest or something yeah yeah I have a beginner question for you guys something that I've been thinking about how do you get your inspiration for new recipes I just got myself a book about flavor pairings and food and stuff like that that's what I'm reading right now everywhere we get them everywhere at least Roger Frank receipt cocktail receives food deserts whatever it is in a book or on the web or whatever wherever yeah like if I just I can sit and read the book and then suddenly it came up something something we did some food thing or whatever it is but then I think aha cute nice big nice s made and I write down the idea that you to see if I can use it or find a way to use it so it's it's no nothing who stops you I also use a lot of perfumes fragrances in in my ideas and it fracture my Ravello it's possible yes sir when you guys started mixing did you did you look for a certain recipe profile and did you have something in mind or like for me and yes he went into a shop and they had flavorings there like a whole shelf full of flavorings and I didn't even know where to start you know used as a beginner you're standing there and you're finding yourself just looking at all the stuff and being intimidated by it I had an idea it's gonna take little taste like this some very poor di demos but not on paper nothing to to compare with or whatever I want it to taste like that and then I begin to try to find a fine hole we've gonna do it and begin to ask people oh oh my gonna mix em whatever fee and both flavors and yeah just mix till of it until I get enough satisfied of what my in what my first point it was like wanna want it to taste like that that's the reason so but but not not any copied from anyone it was just from straight in my own mind so at least I have two sounds I know man sometimes they gonna gonna hit them and make some something up there I'm just reading in the church not yeah I'm not a champion but but in that products you can in fact find something it can be used so as some of these paper products is it's used a bit about cocoa some tropical flavors and so that's possibility to the use as as an ID to develop but as IEDs mix in fact you just just look on the on the 101 name in your bathroom and also same thing if you go out and buy a soda you look on the bottle and see what the stands many times it stands what what they are used in it perhaps present disease to a bit more I just thought yeah is there an English cup of tea flavour they're asking and I don't know hey yeah I'm not sure yeah I need to check it up ii-i've seen something about it at least but I'm not sure if the water flavoring or you need to use some flavours to make it but I bet I've seen some seen something about it then I have a note of it somewhere but my notes is it's not easy to find out that way I have approximately if I if I try to burn it on a DVD it's not it's not going in place in one so approximately a couple of thousand files just on notes though I need some time to find it back but I gonna find it and I give you a put it in in the group about it yeah I don't know I note I make some good teas it's got that strawberry Twi tea they're good there's another one that I have to but I can't remember the name of a pianist with you tie you're in a group what's the other tea you got you got one or two more of the teas I think he's working on a peach tea - if I'm correct you have a peach trees call now when they have blueberry french vanilla tropical tone of tea once the Turner's teas that's the one that's good tea that's real pity that might be the closest early in the English tea it's not exactly an Earl Grey or anything but it's uh it's pretty damn good he has sent me over his is concentrates for tobacco there seriously it's good you get the butterscotch ripple or the butterscotch I haven't shed they it's good Jamaican rum TFA I think and one on one marshmallow Jesus that that stuff is just mowing it really I've never tried anything like yeah he's kind some good flavors he does very good bombs and as I yeah showed before they are quite superb in in hope they made to I don't see any problem we didn't we done whatever basically yeah but the trouble with nuts it's a lot lot of people who try to make it and and they do it very easy and use coffee filter and all this [ __ ] and it yeah the finger is back in back in the bottle isn't well for me at least it's not not anything I won't away and I'll show the thing well about for example the facts who's gonna be behind in this to show your notes and everything fat and sugar Easley is yeah in a way yeah the first centimeter of the of the bottle and you understand its it's not gonna be good for your health I told me once he uses micron filters to so here we given me quite good information about his flavouring and I and I can understand why it's why it's good but I won't say how how everything is its hisses secret so it's let them keep it which is good yeah and I don't I don't see any problem to recommend somebody to try them and that's that's not something I normally do much at least not with Nets I don't it's the first one I find out it was good enough to say I can recommend that so back it back to this way with the yeah a new new mixer the best advice I could give it's infected try it doesn't matter don't try to make make a copy of of a of your most precious read de use your boat you're never gonna make it a similar anyway it's gonna take a lot of time and money and a experimenting to do it make us make more simple mixes and get them right just test out try out it's nothing nothing is it sounded trouble if you don't test you'd done it something wrong or you need to change it don't make big a big mix as well and you don't know it's good enough that's the best advice you could be given that I'll definitely start simple starts and work your way up single flavours there's a lot of good flavors out here that you can just a single flavors and build from them find something you like and then add something to a try experiment do something small don't you get at least no mixable I'm gonna make this what you you you're clueless and how to work with these flavors how the hell are you gonna make it you you're not you you know give a deep flavors it's gonna taste like garbage then you're gonna get disgusted don't do that start losing yeah and don't look at people as me then I put putting out the receipt everyday or whatever it is IIIi use approximately 10 liters with ve GMT D every year just to make tests so then when I make a lot of mixes then for sure somebody's gonna be good it was us a lot twist ain't good with me - but I done it in Maine in a few years done that don't they look up to this so try to find some so mix it up with the flavor you like not specially as a say in waiting think about it is in candy and eating or drinking or whatever it is if it don't like strawberry eat strawberry don't try to make it either not it start at least what taste as you like it and begin to experiment a classic simple strawberry cream that is decent then I had to he's his thing it's just a do like 8% 6 to 8% TFA strawberry ripe or now what the I love that osta my succulent strawberry if you run a net runner that may be fine or no 3 4 % and just saw some cream behind or even an ice cream out of TFA vanilla bean ice cream or liquid barn vanilla ice cream my cat Ellen I'm never gonna like gonna say to to a new mixer start with the strawberry cream the reason is a lot of people don't feel the strawberry taste yeah a lot of people strawberry pie so then you give them advice to make something they don't taste perhaps yeah and the problem you're never gonna make a strawberry and cream you want to make a cream with strawberry yeah if you understand we're never gonna gonna get the strong strawberry taste you overpower everything else right the sweetness in the strawberry is the only thing you can't get real higher than everything else it's a difficult flavor to use and and a lot of people make get trouble to make a good mix of it because they have that they believe it's gonna be otherwise and Veronica gonna it's possible to make it yes strawberries funny you can overpower creams release you with strawberry but on the other hand other flavors you put other fruits behind it can bury that strawberry real easy - you know it's it's a funny funny flavor it is yes but yeah just a simple to flavor grab an ice cream in the strawberry and 12 together for and and you're in you're good that's the simplest and easiest and but like Roger said a lot of people are strawberry blind your best shot at its strawberry blindness with the OS DIY succulent strawberry because there's a lot of people that are strawberry Blanc can taste that I don't know what's different about it I don't know if it's because it's a combination of a whole bunch or what but the lot of the strawberry blind people they can they can taste that pretty well correct different creams strawberry tastes different with like force aid if you use I like that cream milky undertones buy one on one hmm group because it gives it more like a milk flavor but it's totally different if you use that or the middle bean ice cream or or vanilla custard or something like that right robbery's for me changes to inflated so the same thing is everything else it's a lot lot of change is also in cream it is I try to find a strawberry first and play around with different I'm when Jack told me about this succulent strawberry I didn't believe it is normal I don't trust anyone but but almost most agree when I first tasted it it is it is that it's the type of strawberry flavor it's most authentic as I go out in the in the field and pick some strawberry it's the most authentic flavor I've found in in of everyone so yeah it's a superb moist flavor but yes it is it is a sweet as the normal ones are you're gonna get the taste of it's not when when you are picked it and put it in a yeah in a together with sugar and and some it's pure straight from the bush in a way span you don't know how hard it was burned they agree with me told me they kill them for you Roger what is your suggestion then for a starter mixture suggestion about what do you think about flavours or do you think about something else if it's flavor the flavor you like if you like peach if you like banana use banana it just matter it's it's up to you because because yeah I don't like candies I can eat it but not in a way then I never gonna gonna say candy with candy it's ok in a way but somebody likes it so it just find something you like believe you can like and trust good segue in a mind next still here originally I was running a series called never done question and I used to think ok these are just gonna be real short videos one two three minutes answering a quick but you know normal question and be done and the question popped up what are the best flavors to get and I started it so well I can answer that quick and then I started thinking about it and I says oh no this is involved this is you got so many different variables so many things and the only thing I could say is you guys could probably embellish on this is number one you got a I can't tell you what you like you have to get an idea and then you have to try all difference because every different flavors different from each manufacturer so to go slow take that you can look at the recipes that are up like on ELR and stuff like that and look what are the more popular recipes that fit your profile and get an idea but you can't guarantee yourself on those flavors you're gonna like them either because everybody's different it's it's such a hard question Roger do you have any other better ideas not not when when I'm when I'm not knowing anything more if I'm if I know more if I know what people are after it in a you could say in if you were blueberry yeah if you are from Norway you don't want blueberry you won't be merry so there also is a variation who is not similar because in here the blueberry is in out in the nature is it's a typical Bill Murray so I would imagine you go in covering for blueberry then it's wrong so it's I need to know a bit more what people want you devote a strawberry okay do you want a 3d type do you want with the green notes or not and everything but when I know more about this then like a big interest to save what flavor I I won't serve or want to recommend I would also say that manners on you where you're from - like what are you saying because here in the US are are rough fruity flavors are more on a candy site over any you in you they're more on the you know the tannic site correct you know what threw me off I like chocolate and when I started mixing I tried chocolate and it was so frustrating to find Chuck and especially if you're from Germany we have really good milk chocolate stuff like Roger and I mean being a being in the gate only back Marcia bomb every [ __ ] year it tastes different than the chocolate in the states not better or worse just different and I think there are some some areas of flavoring that are more or better suited for beginners than for better soon for advanced and for beginner museums like chocolate I would never suggest somebody to start with the chocolate recipe you know you could pick like you said banana or try a bakery or something like that you'll get you'll get the success faster and it keeps you to mixing if you're right you try to follow a certain profile you want but you can never reach it people will stop mixing sometimes sometimes I mean I was almost at the point after like in three weeks I was I got five six different chocolate flavors and I was like okay I can I can't do that but you also know know that chocolate needs approximately one more for its taping I didn't know yeah then you see Steve there are some flavorings right away like you can buy everybody right away but but not everyone is gonna be beautifully potentional Trader Joe's out there that you can't vape right away and whether it's good or not a different story yeah that's what you saw what a lot about this this leather taste deck yeah steeps that is a ladies dressing it comes down they get more more nice and then yeah that is none of the mountain sugar out in the dirt these ads on here for these people I I didn't do anything change anything different it's gotta be YouTube advertising she's the only one like grey all I hear she's getting upset over it that's that's not a good thing yeah well they're saying they're full color cupboard ads they covered a whole damn thing I'm gonna have the look see if something changed my settings or something and and get rid of it I I don't know what to say let's hope their flavor come free companies that yeah look on the back polar or absolutely yeah it's easier when you see see it from the back my adblock plus this part 123 and that is just flippin crazy honey in 23 ads just from this video alone that's nuts huh that's crazy I'm sorry people it's not my fault you know oh it's oh I can get this turn this thing off - we're done with this but yeah they said the flavouring deal that's like one of the toughest questions you can answer as far as I'm concerned it's just and then so much variations it's it's not possible to to say compare concrete what you fits best because you have the flavors you have where you live and and you watched flavor we are used to and then it's your taste buds also what do you feel about the taste and everybody's different so it's yeah and I think just grabbing a recipe of you are and just mixing something that somebody else did before yeah but you can't even trust that sometimes so I mean it's like are that the one of the better options but you can't even trust that sometimes because sometimes people job you know they they get together in groups and they pump each other up trying to get those ratings up and rating I would just like three flavors and and just try it for yourself my best best advice I can say on the LRS is to find a mixer if you find keep your profile integrity and follow what what he puts out because you can fight you can find a receive series five years old they fit to an old video ego it's not possible yeah I quite use it anymore in the days equipment or it's a lot also a lot of mixes you never have been mixer for sure guarantee it just just made on paper and never mixed it and never taste it and nobody can know if it's okay or not if when we get experience then you see it much much easier but for a new beginner it's it's hard but it's the easy way find the receipt you feel you could like and and form of this mixer only yell are done it's the best chance to to get it okay anyway yeah yeah it's your best you makes some find somebody that is your profile mix it see if you like it if it's even close to something that you like follow and till you get to join your own thing or grab them even as an or mixer you know grab them and and well I can't say brand no but once you mix them for a little bit do you can tweak it to yourself to fit yourself you know it's not hard to say well should this get too much blueberry in it or something just lower it next time that's all it's not this isn't this isn't rocket science what we're doing you know what I mean it's it's not hard it's and don't make big mixes make small mixes in batches and you know it's not a big problem if if it didn't taste so good well well you don't need a flew away a lot of it right let all this motorists a experienced system with a lot of nuance system and stuff and everything let that beat it in you're more experienced it's the best thing you can do it's not rocket science yes it is but the problem is rocket the rocket pops up I'm stupid enough to to go in in molecules and everything I check out whatever it is just you - finally every info I can I can get but I'm not I can't say it it doesn't it doesn't do so much about my mixing I think but perhaps perhaps something it does you see a tiny edge but pretty average mixer we don't they Tommy day you don't you don't need it now just just firm because I like to to kick myself to see if it's possible for me to do it it's nothing it's just a concurrence for myself I'll not get this I look at this whole thing just like cook and everybody knows how to cook and it's basically the same thing you're just using different tools you know what I mean this yes it's not it's not nuts it's just you gotta know what you're working with like you you work with salt you work with pepper you work with paprika you know what they taste like oh yeah that was so you're putting this stuff together you have to know what it tastes like to do it you know what I mean that that's it it's it's no hard it's you know eat certain things react a little bit differently with with other stuff you know one thing might mute something over time but that's just something that you learn as you go and it's you know you're still making stuff that's favorable so don't make it harder than necessary and don't be afraid to try just try it yeah so it's like it don't can it's not going to damage anyone if it's not right okay it don't taste good okay change it no fears yeah corrects but about the you know it's like like any times like but for me for instance I'm trying to learn really heavy-duty video editing you know where you make all the graphics and all that stuff and if my mind goes crazy but I think I look at it like people do here you look at it harder than what it really is you know what I mean all you gotta do is take the time and look at it simply and then everything you know that belt goes up and everything just falls into place it's it's not you know they don't make sense whatever you are doing but not only waiting but in everything if you're unsure you never dominate you you don't know what with dysfunctional then you're yeah you're a bit afraid oh oh oh can i push air and all this stuff yeah that's quite normal everybody does it like that but just try you can do it one way where you say it looks good and you can go crazy and program your plugins for after sex I mean and it's the same correct any just flavorings now from from today the flavorings that are coming out today from just three four years ago that it's incredible but what they're doing with these flavors you know stuff that we use that have the mix three four or five flavors to get that the desired effect that we want we combine them now as single flavors and it just makes things so much easier it really does I think cappellas changed their flavorings free time so something this lost for years yeah I think they think it's three times they have changed them so the the that's one of the reason also I say that all the receipts don't need to fit today because a lot of flavors is changed and a lot of flavors is come and everything and it's not similar anymore right yeah it's a like I said he's nowhere mixers today they got a big advantage and then we had in the past it's I wished I just start but yeah it's a that's a whole problem though I think with a lot of people they get scared they think it's harder than what it really is and you know I remember when I first started makes him like there wasn't so much information out there I was deathly afraid of nicotine I was like oh my god you hear all these like old wives tales and stuff like that it's oh my god I'm gonna do this I'm gonna kill myself you know and once you want to get over that initial you know anxiety it's easy you know it's just the unknown that gets to you as I guess the way I'm trying to get at it it's totally a none of these people and they're scared they're nervous and they just gonna need to step back and take it easy and that's all take your time love win you'll love in the sounds fun well your love Gary well he's been weak a little bit weaker but he has gone down a touch but of course he needs some longer lines to reach to USA yeah yeah from from my from my from my place it's it's don't kneel I will the tie all the way cuz five what's happened it's not euro is that your five euro service at five pounds five pounds yeah for ten milliliters of juice yeah yeah yeah I know but but it also depends I never seen on the cost of a favor but I want a flavour I want it at least to try it and yeah it's it's possibly possible to do it at that price but I also also seen live about 10 mils 400 what it gonna be it's gonna be approximately four dear $45 with shipping 10 mils that's crazy yeah yeah but but I need to try the flavor it was a truffle flavor it was really was yeah it was really good I must say that but yeah I found out it saw me have the the one that saw me happiest is quite similar it's it's a little missing but when you use it you know makes you you don't feel it so then it's good good enough to use salami but it was really it was support this expensive oh my it was ah that's like crazy crazy question you spread something I'll up to that I like to address for these North mixtures because I I did the same damn thing as wavin shap juice I started mixing for myself and immediately it's the sweetener went in immediately and I'm vaping of a penis or no this is pretty good this is pretty good then you're vaping and vaping a vapor I'm getting sick to my stomach after a while and I'm like something's not right here so I cut the sweetener down and I'm vaping and it's starting to get too sweet and more and more and more than finally it's cool I don't need it you know you get used once you start making good juice you don't need that sweetener to hide everything it's like yeah it's just it's just the way it is and I'm not the only one that it's happened to it's and do you know when you're using Tia faced with her it takes approximately ten days before you can get this fully taste when I do you know yeah it does it's a big change from from five to ten days and that's I don't use the standard sweetener it's a it's a what is it five percent a man approximately five percent sucrose I'm veneer yeah it is oh it's yeah yeah it's good I had better be that time didn't before we get it fully taste so I have well you can get it you can get it out from using other flavors you know but correct but I think this is sure extra that if I should tell everybody in this group here is here's a teaser not this Sunday coming up next Sunday I'm I told Roger I was wrong it's next Sunday we're gonna have Rick Rick Laporte on with this the maker of sugar daddy he's gonna be on with this

certificate from real flavors and we got one more person next week or this Sunday coming up and we'll have the next week after that now will that be the week that Richards or Ricky's here what this will do the big giveaway be nice to have a man so you can talk about this stuff I know everybody's raving about it you know about about this sugar daddies Vietnam I I'm not used I think I have a 10 mil bottle I haven't get empty in two years but I see I need to buy a this from Rick just just to test them yeah I I understand how they could function it's I it was easy to see they should be great but okay I I give up I need to buy them just to try I got this right now I mean and and the finger tastes it's very sweet but it's like a creamy creamy sweet and it's gone and then but that's because it's on the finger but I get a little tiny op note on the tongue but I could see very easily how I can get covered up in a mix but it does have up the finger just a tiny little we are we have the finger yeah I use my knuckle per me I it's hard to say it's um like medicinal no no it's like a Brenda compared with normal or sugar it's sweet like normal sugar but it's got an ego from me that stevia always has like an uneasy - it's not anise and I'm trying to put my it's almost like a it's not like a burnt yeah like a fur caramel like a matte not a burnt her taste to it but that's like I said that's uh I mean charred - it's got but like I said I could see it getting covered up in a mix really easy yeah yeah well this is I think it's gonna work really well I'm just about it as I am pretty - it was it's yeah I mean it it's sucralose in it and this also stevia that before we gonna get Sonya so minor back notes or off not in a way but as you say if it's easy to yeah my Mia the cooperates what was the trouble I'm taking this at full for whack here on my tongue so I got a given you know getting some so I can air now the cinnamon like I just tasted this am I not the cinnamon in na and I did the vanilla and the cool the other day what amazes me about this is the guy at least in here of the is he put that in the background so nicely it doesn't overpower the vanilla it is so cinnamon it just sits there nicely in the background in that sweetness and it he just has the perfect ratio for it like I said I haven't mixed too yet but I will I'm gonna make some tonight well this is a cinnamon cinnamon I just taste it here but he's got the vanilla in the in the cool tool but it's the cinnamon is let me try it again here he made a lot of sweeter types once and then cinnamon sweetener a cool sweetener vanilla sweetener and standards Vietnam this enemy is struggle daddy name it's a tiny bit more in the candy side it's not like the like a cinnamon stick cinnamon it's naturally because of the sweetener behind it makes you want to go to the candy side but it's good it's at the the ratio at least as far as I know is good I gotta make smoke I know well he just said he was just raising mavin about it they're all great I like the icy cool I'll even care for this in Lima terrible this guy in California is it's wrecked by the Sun for four days gonna be Rhino matter what you need some ice I don't understand why he needs cool what she views and using normal natural wool compared to using the candle stuff I use moji I've been using no cheaper forever so I don't know be honest with you I'm cheap when I bought I got this Muji right here I got enough to last me for the next couple years and I don't need to buy anymore I don't I don't play her out I'm cheap by using some bacon sticks and I tried some special stuff also which called light Bechet what is it so it's cotton and everything this it's this it's the same thing it it's not so big difference it's cut back in I feel it's okay but I also use Muji and everything I thought I don't feel a big difference in taste it's only perhaps the first five minutes or so after a little while it's not not a big change in taste so is the difference in the beginning - yeah you have less flavor when I first started out I was just using cotton balls a lot of people in Europe and in Germany they just used cotton out of the store you know the stuff you need for cosmetics and stuff like that right yeah correct find the cheapest one love it and they find out here in Norway the cheapest one you can get yeah I'm not bleaching and everything yeah well it's quite okay anyways perhaps in in some tanks whenever you saw or the TAS when you have when you have the coil on top and you need me the good socking of the week perhaps it could be some some minor changes but I don't see that the difference between the mouth after a little while so I use this mochi like I said and I get a can taste for maybe like the first three wax and then it goes and I'm you know hmm so I'm happy with it I don't like I said I'm just probably because I'm cheap but I don't go playing with all this other stuff there's a lot there's a lot of crappy premium cut yeah there's a lot of lot of sale freak yes it's a Luger loh dalam yeah yeah yeah see on these things waivers choice cotton in the in waitress choice we trust and everything and when I come to cotton fax it's quite just normal cotton I don't see the point in it but it looks nice though wait a bit I need I need to talk again somebody's always gonna come out with some kind of gimmick just so it's not sunny special more than something else thanks big time maxi pads on work yeah I've seen the video work that uses a tampon well thank you imagine not sterile if you need something to week with it doesn't matter you use whatever you have so it is yeah it's just something when you were smoking when you get when you get empty with cigarette paper what did you do then Ray's asking about rayon I never tried it so I know I tried it once but I didn't find it was any good or yeah better than the other ones so I never bought it just tried it from a friend I didn't see the point in buying oh that's right on that ECU's kneeled like the old clearomizers here's the kanger whatever the hell they were I can t remember we you know the law and I used to rebuild them you know I these last couple videos of me building I have spools of that stuff I wonder if I could take that stuff and bunch it up and link to a coil remember black one or a red one yeah I remember you see buddy this I know my first one was called just 5tx it was very very minor but I don't know where it is acts at moment them I'm doing a review and this thing this is a fragile you remember they're talking about battery life yeah I think this is the key I think this is an atheist little thing any I know you remember I said it was a copy product or they sold it that detects logo oh yeah well yeah but this is this man I don't know this this is a pocket chart you know this pen this pen here goes inside it just goes in your packet 2200 or 2250 milliamp battery and the charger it's only 200 milli amp on the pen the pen supposed to be good for 150 wax but once you put it in that charger it recharges and a half hours what I think I like about this more than anything is I remember back when I was using like the spinners and stuff like that I put it in my pocket and be outside the one yardwork raking leaves or doing something you bend over and I'd bust the damn battery and the spinner you know right where the clearomizer hits this is perfect this thing ain't gonna break you put this in your pocket and you're good I just I got it yeah you have a thing that's as big as as a cigarette box and it slides in there and it's magnetic and the thing is actually just like a power bank you can you can charge this one here I think it's got 360 there's a milliamp hours yeah you can charge it like four times with the pack and it's awesome yeah can't wait to get this single sorry this thing together it's um I understand I again I am starting to get all I'm stuck with this big ideas and stuff all the time switching from from smoking to vaping now they need something that reminds them of a cigarette and that's I mean all you need to do here is just drag yeah yeah no pushing buttons no wicking no nothing correct everybody's getting away from all the big stuff with the with the you know the clouds you don't see so much about the big competitions anymore at least I don't see you see them once in a while but I think people are just getting more towards the flavor in the nicotine now at least that's why I see it yeah but it's correct I see it all all over the world in fact I see this this what should I call me this street style with with the disclose chasing is falling down a bit well I think there's a lot of women getting into vaping melody and what I heard from a lot of them who said they don't want to carry around a big mod where were that yeah sir in that purse or whatever if they if they get a stick you know there's a nasty women I I don't want to I actually you know what I feel naked if I go out of the house without like something like this you know 3d batteries I need I need some weight so I know I have my not know where you can find it that don't need need to be begin to look for it in every pocket you have I was in the garden mowing the lawn the other day and I was like somewhere buried in the pocket getting so small you can't even find it did you guys ever see that that meat pot thing that's that that refillable pot system little square thing yeah this sonic stuffer I think it's yeah I think that's it yeah hmm I see I I'm not tried it but with a saw a review on it for a short time ago yeah yeah something like it I had that I had that in my hand at the vapor expo in Birmingham that thing so tiny I would lose it like every day I need to buy one every day cuz it's seriously it's like it's crazy it's like a pack of matches just dinner Oh underneath discount a big discount yeah with a lanyard though so you don't lose it yeah I used like say I remember back with the old spinner days they Pam my packet sitting down been there I used to call to them left and right busting them you know it's something a lot of times you can put them back together but a lot of time see they were shot and now the lanyards with the tool which when you checked inside in this old ones and see see the size over there by ocean and oh yes all that was connected understood that's good yeah and you can only Saturn once or twice to cuz you can't reach down in there the wire arm either you know what I mean yeah so it's it's crazy but but okay it did function so I got a lot of people stop smoking so yeah it's okay yeah it is but I must say I think it's gonna take a long time before I begin to go uh go around with just a small tiny thing around my neck I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't think yeah I need something yeah yeah you're probably okay that could be nice at least people don't think I can hear what they say and that's superb exactly yeah I'm not some salt with our 'vote you need to talk into the mouthpiece yeah and even though a date also popped in there these late at a party anyway it's it's nice to see it's the whole raping system is developing it's not stopped in any way it's it's going gonna move forward whatever everybody in vaping is gonna die off it turned out the opposite thing yes it's just going out there because the first thing you get to get away all these unserious pupil and shops they're gonna be disappear because they have no choice to chance to be yeah you have to be contained in this controller of this yeah regulations and that done for 40 okay a bit lower as small time before all the the companies who have chance and is serious enough to be in these regulations and I begin to start and done it protest again it I see the last number from you from UK and in 2014-15 it was taught about approximately 10,000 uses in in the market in the UK in February this year it was over 30,000 yeah with registrated under the government regulation you have it go down we froze there for a second I don't know why but we did we're back is it called them should be good now that should be good well i think i think the community did a large portion of work here for vaping to be also accepted by the general market and and all the people on the street too but people went out there and they didn't care if people look funny you know and and look at them funny but if you see in Europe now the tobacco companies they they collaborate with vaping companies now hmm because they found out pretty soon there's there's the number of smokers is gonna go down I mean I don't know who it was I think Philip Morris announced that they had - of 30% this year or last year correct that says something about the market and I don't know what what tobacco company it was but they just teamed up with the company from Europe and they brought out another pot system like that's the only way you can they're gonna be able to survive yeah eventually it is holy but I think the community did that because vaping is so accepted now all over the world that that servers are just gonna run away from them from the tobacco companies and smoking if the community haven't been there how in the hell should people have learned about how they gonna not use this how it could not gonna spread there and and be shown than people could find out anything about it it's not it haven't been probably it could be done you can look at it this way - Roger you know you're talking about that when tobacco started they plastered the airwaves and everything you know back in the 50s and the 60s and 40s you know they had an advantage vaping didn't have that advantage - limited right advertisement for vaping and look at how big it got yeah that's correct plus I never a competition yeah yeah I mean chewing tobacco that yeah it was only put two or three or four of them knows about it you know and those patches the nicotine patches they never caught on because it didn't work yeah they work to an extent of you know not much but I have learned from anybody get off of cigarettes because well miss you like in the habit you know didn't you lose that Anita I remember when I tried to quit smoke and I tried it the chantix and I went nuts I would have ended up in jail it was an amazing yeah they're pills it it changed my mind so bad I was had such a short fuse with that stuff if he looked at me sideways I wanted to kill you you know it was it was crazy I finally I got a hold on my doctor I says doc I gotta get off these things they said I'm gonna end up in jail just in the US they paid approximately I don't remember exactly the numbers no but it was a couple of times they need to pay approximately a hundred million each time just in fee for in the legal and discussion about to have used its chanting stuff all kind of horrible horrible [ __ ] it totally messed with my mind it was turned me in a whole different person I was like almost like a psycho killer it was also to suicide about its impression and everything so have you heard there's no heat Napper and it just came out it's just cigarette stuff in am and that it a nice aluminum vape shops I read something about that that they got something that doesn't I heard some about it and I looked at one but I'm waiting approximately a Porsche say some mums that I can test it out what it is but about health stuff and so you can say it's it's a bit more like like chewing tobacco then wiping is it's a minor with a health than this heat and burn stuff but I don't know exactly the number oh my boyfriend the thing is though Steve I I tried the icons yeah and it's in the stores here you can buy it in regular drugstores and I tried it there and the thing is the heating temperature is like I think 300 degrees Celsius instead of like 800 for you combust the tobacco and I don't think that there's a whole lot of like ingredients in there getting into your bed you know giving cancer and stuff but it tastes it tastes like like sucking on an old cigarette filter taste is just horrible I mean seriously like if you don't line up or and you breathe through a cigarette and or you're like licking or smelling a cigarette filter that's those things days I don't think it's a big future on my I can't say anything about it if it's gonna be it or not but for me I I'm I'm not sure about it I'm questioning me because if you if you look back on tobacco them when I started in the 70s to try to make a a more better smoke then I began to use a lot of these additives and I'm afraid perhaps they're gonna do the same thing in their devices too and then they gonna ruin the whole thing whatever so I look for Pressey just says it's Big Tobacco trying to get in there yeah they are the thing is a lot of big tobacco companies they understood that selling like physical tobacco does matter in which form it's gonna be consumed it's not compute I mean dignity is to be extracted from tobacco there's no and as far as I know there's no way to chemically have synthetic they haven't yeah oh is it oh yeah yeah but it's expensive and not much made so it's difficult to get it but I'm pretty sure they're gonna be concentrating pretty soon in just selling nicotine or e-cigarettes why should they make just as much money from can I say buy because there's not many tobacco companies to make nicotine yeah it's or other product users to make the nicotine just wait till they find out how to do it yeah it's it's quite easy in a way but okay it's so me some work done but I know this name sigma-aldrich in the Germany a big pharmacy company I think is it sigma-aldrich or something well I don't remember the name now it's a big company in a way with the especially and then the main companies in in Germany and they are making molecules and and stuff for for pharmacy and so they have the big nicotine may a producer they have a lot of places in East New Marais of making the tobacco growing taking it to Europe and and I yeah refine it to to the stuff we wait but they don't sell it direct to private people and all that stuff and not are not seen in writing anywhere so oh pretty much yeah that's the same thing is gonna be on the on the whole Europe in in a short while anyway maximum 20 milligrams and 10 mils there this and because because a lot of them are afraid of not keeping this value of 20 mils may 20 milligrams they are going down to 18 milligrams to be sure so for me it we decide then I don't test it it's not it's easy to test imatra nicotine the strength of it so I don't see the big problem that well what so what is I like I am I did a review for what the heck is it the liquid a wholesale liquid nicotine and they gave me their regular Nick in there Nick salts and I played with both of them and I liked them I you can run the Nick with the Nick salts much higher it gives you a throat it like like a regular cigarette it gives you that whack and it hits you a lot faster you can you get hit with that Nick a lot faster for like the vape pens and stuff like that excellent you know what I mean you want to run hi Nick 12 14 18 24 milligrams Nick it's fantastic it's not salt like it's regular nicotine and at the expo I I met the guys from J world and they have pots I think they're gonna be selling in the states that are based on salt except they had I think it was 35 they were among the 48 I'll tell you what though they gave me a sample of their regular Nick and that stuff was smooth as silk I couldn't believe it I don't know if I got a lucky batch because I'm one of these guys that I believe that everybody has sells good Nick it's just the matter of the batch that they get you know what I mean all this stuff comes in a big tankers you can do and that's happen to me you deal with one company for like two years then I was Center next time you order you get crap from him you know but the [ __ ] I got from from that liquid nicotine wholesalers the regular Nick was I couldn't even tell there was nicotine in it I and and the only way I was able to verify it was I did a titration test on it and the Nick was there and it was right on the money uh I got a hundred milligram PG Nick and I think it registered at a 100 point zero four or something like that was like frayed out of money but it was smooth oh my got it so that's stuff like that you can run up to 18 milligram and you'd never even taste it you know it was good it was very good yeah nicotine is normally harvested four times a year I found out the plants and then it depends how long it could it's it's it's been from the its harvested til it's sold as a nicotine base first one in Germany we are not able to buy large amounts of nicotine or milligram strength beyond 20 milligrams so everybody before I think it was May 1st or something of last year so a year ago now everybody stocked up you know they got a liter liter bottles with like 48 milligrams so they have enough nicotine for the month and I got some myself too and in the beginning it was it was nice and I mixed some the other day and it it was harsh I mean it was burning the nicotine producer don't say it's approximately best way to use it is in approximately 18 months yeah they also say best storage is between 8 to 12 degrees sensors so they don't say freeze it don't refrigerate it and so and search things so it depends a story gonna stay longer if you if you cool it any more but how much I don't know as far as nicotine like I said I really honestly with with every company you know like it said thing everybody has searched favorites but a year from now they might get something crappy from I remember dad it was a couple of maybe three or four years ago I my freedom smokes here in the US had a sale going on I bought a it was a one liter of 100 milligram nicotine and there was cyclones like $40 or something I was super cheap and everybody was conviction about their nicotine I'm granted it wasn't the the best in the world but man it was good it was smooth you know what I mean it was nothing like this stuff that I just got now from liquid nicotine wholesalers but it was good it was you know I was vey pible you could barely detect it in your mix and I think it's like I said I think it really is hit and miss I've heard people talk about that me my freedom smokes before I say oh that's garbage is garbage Nick well I had good stuff you know what wasn't you know the pure pure but it was great it was good and I you know you hear people talk about what the other one there the not nicotine River there they uh-oh shoot the other one it's also Nick salts here in the US yeah but it's it's the same thing you can get the bad batches and they can get good batches and so long but long and being in storage before you buy it and it makes sense like you said if they're only producing it four times a year here you got and towards the end and it's not stored properly yeah it's something's gonna happen and Nick salts for me it's it's what I call it I don't call it [ __ ] but for me it's not interesting in any way normally I use I use between 1 1 2 to 3 milligrams of Nick right it's just for the flavor stuff I don't need NICU for craving for for the nicotine anymore and why should I should I need need to take in 12 milligrams of 80 milligrams I don't need it why should I do it with no psych I couldn't stand it for for new and new vapor we started to vape and so now I understand I mean they have this nicotine craving and that I need it yeah but but form for me or people have made a long time I don't see the reason for it and and also if you're making Nick salt in three milligrams and you using normal freebase on three milligrams you don't feel any change in taste it's only on the higher amounts of thoughts you're really gonna feel the smooth change in different from the freebase yeah now you're right so yeah yeah my point about the gurney you start getting up there you know ii like eight and higher yeah it's not working it starts wagging me pretty good internet that they use zoic acid to correct each level when they produce correct i I don't know what that does when it's I know some I know some scientists he's discussing it but I haven't got a found on a correct answer on it yet but I've asked I've email companies have asked tons of people and the the the the information is not just not area Diana stuff it's just now there's I was so dumb but I trained it to a titration test on it and it was saying after all charts and I'm like so finally I can't act and I'm a nice as well what's going on here I can't dude oh no you can't to a titration test that I don't know but but I must miss a mix of this perhaps noise it's ever in higher MD is on so but it's a lot anything we are we are stupid smoking and start vaping to get all of these cigarettes that we'd also say this we are trying to get off nicotine and the voice should then need to begin to start and wait hi mg is again this was question one advocacy guy from a u.s. SPR one day so he's right we are starting to vape to to come off this cigarette and a nicotine craving craving everything and then we suddenly go back again and start up again with nicotine so here's

have a great day", "xTxUoFcJeCs": "hello and welcome to lecture number 25 continue our lecture from last time we're talking about morphine and opioid pain relievers we're gonna continue talking about those opioid and opiate pain relievers focusing on those narcotic pain relievers and then finish up with some addiction and treatment options so that'll be some important information please remember these lectures are for educational purposes consult your physician or pharmacist for any questions about medications you may be taking the profession everything presented here is based on peer reviewed scientific evidence and those citations but not always and I'll provide some resources at the end let's continue we were talking about in the previous lecture we just finished talking about morphine the next derivative of opium poppies is codeine it's certainly one of the most commonly prescribed medications usually combined with aspirin or acetaminophen for relief of mild to moderate pain as a high degree of dependency about 40% of users will become dependent on this drug this particular drug is metabolized into morphine by the cytochrome p 2d6 and so those clinical effects tend to be due to morphine now we'll talk here a little bit about some variations on that particular enzyme in the in that codes for that enzyme other thing to keep in mind is that enzyme itself can also be blocked by certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors those SSRIs can block metabolism of codeine in the morphine and so you want to talk with your doctor about all the drugs that you're taking if this is you will be taking for heroin is of course the primary target of abuse in this class it's three times more important potent than morphine it has much greater lipid solubility which results in rapid crossing of the blood-brain barrier that's why people get a big rush or high that is far more immediate and potent than morphine and this is where we get back to basic learning principles on that injection of that drug is associated with that really sudden hi and so that reward is associated with that behavior a great deal more than it is with some of these other drugs highly illegal in the United States it's the Schedule one narcotic no medical use whatsoever well sometimes mix heroin with cocaine and that's called speedball we talked a bit about that in the lecture on cocaine the effects offset one another but create serious multi a drug addiction that is difficult to treat so there's going to be certainly quite a different high associated with that and it's particularly dangerous so please be mindful hydromorphone and oxymorphone hydromorphone is dilaudid and structure related to morphine it's about six times as potent often referred to as synthetic heroin long-acting versions of these drugs are available for treating chronic pain and those sensitized opiates so these are potential drugs for use in on a pain patients a lot it is certainly is clinically in some areas a paradeen is also Demerol it's also potentially addictive it's generally used as an intramuscular preparation for use in clinics I can tell you from experience this is very painful so it's a it's use as a drug of abuse is a little bit limited by that particular phenomenon but it certainly is often used as a pre-op medication methadone is primarily used to treat heroin addiction or other opiate addiction it covers and blocks the effects of heroin withdrawal so it is immunised opioid it's effective in treating chronic pain it's about one-tenth as potent as morphine so it potentially has that use about one third of heroin addicts experience withdrawal from methadone so these non holders are sorry would earth withdrawal when taking methadone all those non holders so methadone is often used as a treatment for a heroin you probably heard of methadone clinics there's usually a lot of around those the problem is is that users usually have to come in every day as they're trying to and get those heroin Oh down oxycontin Perkin an this is a semi-synthetic opioid similar to morphine this is the drug that has been sort of wreaking havoc across areas I know in Appalachian region they call it hillbilly heroin it was intended as a slow-release pain reliever for treatment of chronic pain oxycontin was but then people discovered that if you crushed it and snorted it it was much more readily available to create a high so people usually crush and snort or then dilute inject it to sort on release mechanism some of the attempts at this point to limit the abuse of these drugs has to do with making them more difficult to crush making them so they're not water soluble so injecting them or snorting them won't be as effective but that's generally what's happened now one of the problems with this particular drug is people become addicted to it and then discover they can't find it or it's more expensive so they switch to heroin because it's cheaper and so that's a huge problem this is a drug there's a lot of controversy around because there are a lot of pain clinics in some areas particularly places like West Virginia where there was far more oxycontin being sent to West Virginia than there were people which is pretty remarkable after codone there's a common synthetic codeine used to treat mild or moderate pain it's metabolized in hydromorphone and so that's where you get that pain again that's at cytochrome p 6 it's usually combined with acetaminophen lortab is an example and percocet this is a commonly abused drug because we're pretty readily available they can be particularly addictive and certainly abused one of the biggest problems with them is that it contains a benefit in sedum in offend has a high degree of how to toxicity people that are taking a lot of this drug oftentimes have of your Limor damage because I want all our acetaminophen can cause pretty severe liver tull is of course another drug that we're hearing a great deal about in the current climate because it's just appearing in so many places it's available as an injectable or as a transdermal patch as lollipops as a dissolvable tablet one of the issues with fentanyl is that it can very rapidly cross the skin and a transdermal administration and so people that touch things that have been coated with fentanyl oftentimes King us have long term pain relief properties it is a potent narcotic with a high risk of respiratory failure and dependence one of the issues we've been seeing lately is heroin and even cocaine tainted with fentanyl causing fentanyl overdose in a number of patients in clinical use it's often used in conduction both midazolam which we'll talk about when we get to sedatives but it's used in these Conte and what are called conscious sedation procedure as alam is anti-anxiety and also causes you to not remember anything that happens the procedure but you need to be awake for and then the fentanyl makes it so that you don't experience for example if you're having your wisdom teeth extracted you kind of have to be awake for that but what they'll do is they'll give you this combination of drugs and then you won't experience any pain and you won't remember the procedure the biggest issue with fentanyl it is as lethal in relatively low doses particularly in people who have sort of a narcotic naive now as a result it can be particularly lethal this is one of these areas we're really having a problem with drugs of abuse if you're preneur fiend is a partial opioid agonist and this is I think of my money and exciting drug for treating opioid addiction it's used in subu texts it has a ceiling to its analgesic effects some common side effects include flu-like symptoms but it's a possible medication for treating heroin it in subutex or now sorry suboxone is combined with buprenorphine along with naloxone and so what happens then is heroin users don't experience withdrawal or Fein because it also contains naloxone if they do abuse they're gonna get nothing out of them because that naloxone is in a block frame at all is another potential partial opioid agonist it has a dual analgesic action it actually works on norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake and of much tramadol is taken in conjunction with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor you can get what's called serotonin syndrome and we'll talk more about that when we get to antidepressants and it all is a potential drug people trying to avoid the standard opiates and has low abuse potential it can be useful there are three clinically available pure opioid antagonists which all block the receptors are cane or naloxone is injectable it's also available as a nasal spray it's used to treat opioid intoxication and but will precipitate withdrawal so anytime you may be involved in ministering narcan to somebody you want to make sure that you call 9-1-1 right away exone is orally absorbed it's used in chronic therapy to event prevent opioid relapse and then now nelma f\u00e9in is an injectable to treat narcotic overdose induced respiratory failure arcane isn't one that we see the most because it's really easy to administer and we'll talk about its administration here in just a bit it is an important thing to understand how it works and understand that it will precipitate withdrawal and so calling 9-1-1 is an important that gets us to naloxone for opioid overdose so it can be safely administered as an intramuscular injection via IV and as a nasal spray and so the biggest thing to keep in mind is most often people will have the nasal spray above if it's a I am injection any muscle will do leg muscle arm muscle and the muscle the effect is rapid those i''m injections have longer duration of efficacy estimating the appropriate dose is difficult i can cause elevation and blood pressure most kits contain 0.4 milligrams per milliliter and the dosage will depend on the body weight and dose of the opioid looked at some of the instructions and usually they come with as I recall it was too nasal sprays and the administer the first and then the second if they don't respond I can't recall but it's a time is critical kind of thing administer it and call 911 right away I do want to talk for a moment about genetic opioid metabolic defects the cytochrome p450 2d6 and 3a4 i so enzymes account for over 90% of opiate metabolism um but what's interesting is not everyone has the sort of same genetic makeup of this we call the Jena genetic opioid metabolic defect in in one of these enzymes so we have rapid and ultra metabolizers and what can happen with the rapid ultra metabolizers is they can end up creating so much hydromorphone for example from hydrocodone that they overdose but it's also possible that we have a sort of non metabolizers that aren't metabolizing the drugs out in so they're bypassing that cytochrome p450 system and as a result of repeated administration they can end up in overdose you can actually check your genetics of this particular defect through the 23andme health report it's been added to that recently tolerance of these drugs we get progressive failure receptors to initiate a signal receptors are desensitized that's in chronic use for intermittent use little if any tolerance develops and they retain their initial efficacy so these drugs are really particularly effective for occasional use for pain they are not meant to be chronically used except for in the critically ill terminally oh I should say tolerance may become Cellmark that massive doses have to be ministered to either maintain a degree of euphoria or prevent withdrawal discomfort in terminal patients the amount of morphine or fentanyl administered would be lethal to almost anyone as they've often been taking it for days and weeks sometimes even months then those high doses are required physical dependence is that altered physiological estate induced by the drug withdrawal elicits these biological reactions which are generally the opposite of the pharmacological effects magnitude will depend on dose frequency and duration of drug dependency so the longer you have been using a drug they higher the doses you've been using the more frequently human using the greater the dependency so a couple of ways to assist you in withdrawal there's one called clonidine assisted detoxification buprenorphine assisted detox and rapid anesthesia aided detoxification and the anesthesia aided to cut detoxification is essentially they put you under using something like allow you to detox and sleep through the whole thing abstinence syndrome will include depression anxiety and drug craving that may last for some time so in addition to the detoxification they'll need to be some additional intervention along with so the acute effects of opioids and the rebound withdrawal symptoms so the analgesia once you've taken that away you can get pain or irritability you need hyperventilation because you no longer Russian increased blood pressure all sorts of changes in physiological properties so freeze over action there's an opposite reaction so with the acute action you get the withdrawal sign these drugs you really get a serious amount of withdrawal so we've really reached an epidemic proportion of opioid deaths there were forty seven thousand six hundred of odorous overdose deaths and 2017 from these drugs so we get a reduction in used to predict prescription drugs but an increase in heroin use over these years so if we look at all overdose deaths and the opioid related deaths you can see a pretty dramatic increase in opioid related deaths versus non opioid related deaths there has been another uptick in methamphetamine of overdose deaths I just saw recently that a number of jurisdictions are reporting that a methamphetamine has overtaken opioids in overdose fatalities look at deaths from opioid pain relievers the most at-risk group from death from opioid pain relievers is actually older adults middle-aged to older adults and of course younger adults as well but 45 to 55 this is the range at which that overdose death is most likely compared 1999 to 2014 these are the deaths per 100,000 very isolated and then now it's a pandemic across the United States if you look this region right here the collections have seen really huge problems in this area and then you can also see lots of rural areas as well so some reactions to the increase in opioid misuse so some attempts to try to sort of solve this problem changes in clinical terms or status we talk about opioid use disorder or addiction arising from medical treatment we call prescription opioid use disorder so [Music] we're sort of waiting for some regulatory guidance but the FDA safety and innovation Act in the 2011 prescription drug abuse prevention plan from the Office of National Drug Control Policy called for some FDA guidance and so we really need some better top-down regulation in this area and so there is some effort being made in these areas and certainly one of the things that we've turned to now is there are a number of lawsuits against the companies that make these drugs and even some of the individuals involved so here's some sort of drafts language for deterrent use so physical and chemical barriers I talked about a minute ago to prevent chewing crushing grinding or extraction with water or alcohol some agonist antagonist combinations that will block that euphoria but get the pain effect a version that is to try to reduce pleasant effects as doses increase livery systems that might make this better some pro drugs which have to be transformed in the GI tract so they have to be swallowed so they couldn't be crushed snorted or injected or some combination of these so these are some potential deterrent formulations for keeping people from abusing these drugs there's certainly a lot of collateral damage from opioid abuse HIV infections from needle sharing are on the rise in Anderson Indiana we saw a huge outbreak in one year and these tend to be linked to needle sharing one of the big problems we see is that needle exchanges are often illegal or it's even illegal to possess needles and so it makes it harder to get clean needles and that's a huge problem and so one of the things we have to watch for is trying to come up with harm reduction tactics so providing clean needle exchange for HIV potentially getting these users on Truvada which is an HIV prevention drug and then the hepatitis C infections is another issue from that needle some harm reduction things like needle exchanges more widespread availability of naloxone in some places it's available without a prescription of providing safe injection sites this has worked in a number of countries that provide safe injection sites supervised by medical personnel and oftentimes those people who come to these safe injection sites are then far more able and far more likely to get help or even are able to sort of slow down their injection use and come off the drugs by simply reducing user time we certainly need increased availability of treatment programs using the best evidence-based practices that's where some of the drugs we're going to talk about next come from is this evidence-based programs so current evidence suggests pharmacotherapy using either methadone or suboxone with supportive psychotherapy is the best without medication assistance many people cannot work or live in the community and so this combination of pharmaco therapy with supportive psychotherapy is our best bet now a lot of people oppose this yeah because they say you're replacing one drug with another you're placing one drug with one that isn't going to kill you and also that you have the potential to step down off of eventually at least that's the hope problem is some people sort of then the end abutments bakso and forever but it's better than the alternative methadone maintenance programs the goals are to rehabilitate the dependent person reduce needle Association disease illicit drug use in the crime associated with it predictor of success is the maximal dose this programs that prescribe doses of greater than 100 milligrams daily have higher retention rates as that restruck doses to less so at a hundred and sixty milligrams a day about one thirds of Nan holders once daily schedule these tend to be where these programs reach only about 20% of the dependent persons in the u.s. oftentimes they're limited in terms of the numbers of people see they're almost always located somewhere that's inconvenient because people are so afraid of having a methadone clinic controversial requires daily visits to a clinic and so it's that that's the big problem which is buprenorphine naloxone the buprenorphine component controls withdrawal symptoms and the naloxone component blocks the effects of any of the opioid drugs which eliminates the potential for overdose or RIA buse so this I think is a terrific drug can be taken as a pill box those withdrawal symptoms but also if somebody relapses and abuses they're not going to get anything out of it because the naloxone is gonna block that this has been shown to be highly effective very recently a study demonstrated that CBD might be successful in reducing the craving for a drug and the anxiety associated with drug use they found in this particular case and this is a CBD product that is available in the US for treating epilepsy that was effective in reducing heroin users craving and anxiety responses to drug they did in this study is they probably an users and one of the things that happens when you provide abuse related cues a needle you know all the apparatus associated with using heroin oftentimes it will induce craving and they found that this particular product was successful in relieving that particular craving so that is it for our introduction to opioids and their dependence and treatment for more information these guides are certainly great - lots of resources available and our next lecture we're going to talk about other types of drug treatment nonce laboratory drugs and other options for",

whose combined efforts with the plans become a reality but far mooned the plan itself he kept secret a fuse for men new in its entirety the plan of this greatest of combined operations in London and Washington British and American offices were placed at adjoining desks and it worked through the days and nights of grinding toil that lay ahead and gradually in the enforced daily intimacy men grew

you are to do duty in North Africa as a soldier of the United States any kind of a kick why North Africa what was the plan called Acrobat the convoy from America was heading east the one from Britain heading south but a given point west of Gibraltar the British convoy would divide for 12 hours the two halves would proceed in opposite direction then the second half would reverse its course and follow the first passing Gibraltar 24 hours behind thus with clock-like precision the combined operations would begin with simultaneous landings at Casablanca or ran algiers casablanca and protect our flank against an axis attack for Spanish Morocco or ranan Algiers to secure bases from which to press Eastern then the occupation of Tunisia from which we could cut Ronald supply lines across the Mediterranean next trap and destroy Rommels Afrika Corbett we now relied forces from the British Eighth Army thus one arm of the access pincer would be amputated and supply lines around the Cape of

one phase of a larger strategy included there in bombings of gentlemen Naples sure in precision bombings of the Renault factory turning out Rommels tanks all these apart landlord Ahmed which the enemy still knew nothing nothing of the submarine trip to Africa by General Mark Clark with a message to be smuggled into France nothing of the arrival at Gibraltar of General Eisenhower when he was joined by general only zero would receive general Clark's smuggled message the enemy knew nothing until the last possible moment when the first half of the convoy from Britain steamed past the fortress of Gibraltar it was at night that the ships pass through the Straits the time had been carefully chosen were here in narrow waters attack seen sittin aboard ship and on the rock everyone stood - but the ships moved steadily on it was as though for the moment the enemy's sword had fallen from his hand through indecision this time it was enrollment in Berlin and the rights burned or not for the first

months earlier to a client of Casablanca stood the convoy from America to the troops aboard spoke their commander General Patton soldiers and sailors is nothing whether the French African army will contest our landing but also resistance by whomever all must be destroyed however when any of the faced soldiers seek to surrender he will accept it and treat them with respect you are brave upon and you chiral I remember the French are not Nazis or jazz December the 8th 1942 orders of the day the words playful transmitted by the past force commander signifies that all forces there to take vigorous and offensive action against the enemy a large searchlight shown in a vertical position at night signifies that the enemy has agreed to the terms of the alive turn around from America's

would these please be on sir play ball Microsoft Casablanca meantime at Alger's our landing craft also met far from shore batteries which were soon silenced by ships of the British Navy here true the French troops ashore were asked by radio to indicate a friendly attitude by throwing their such light beams vertical it wasn't long before here and there along the coast searchlights were seen pointing to the heavens as dawn broke fighter planes from Gibraltar fitted with extra fuel tanks took off without even waiting to hear whether the landing fields of Algiers had been kept by 7:00 a.m.

land forces united under general eisenhower they were ready to take the field once more on particular the Stars and Stripes the Union Jack through side by side but the enemy had lost no time across the Mediterranean by sea and by air he was plotting and and equipment into Tunis and visit despite this we determined to start the campaign at once hoping to reach the distance it is before the enemy's grasp could become too strong this was a bold decision for the British 1st army was as yet little more than one division and the bulk of the American forces were needed to safeguard our position in Morocco we had other disadvantages roads were poor railway seen adequate the enemy beyond the mountains had short supply lines from Sicily and Sardinia our own stretching forward from the improvised basa Dodgers were four times the length even more important we lacked as yet forward airfields whereas the enemy in Tunisia had all the permanent airfields he needed in less than a month the weather would break could are slender force in the last days of autumn a cave of flanking success against time and a stronger enemy with immense energy the attempt was made by Road allied infantry tanks and artillery move towards the hills by rail when General zeros men with mules amount of transport by the British and American parachutists to capture suitable ground for airfields and the technical points near bar I see when commanders tabuchi and burn the letter 300 miles to the east and only 60 miles from the Tunisian border here the airfield which our parachutist Erdogan was already under attack from it was our only permanent forward airfield and had to be fought for repeatedly in three columns we advance towards Tunis and visit and still enemy poured into Africa by mid November

but even as we withdrew to regroup our forces we encountered a new enemy winter was upon us our hastily improvised airfields were flooded our planes earthbound the roads became running screams our tanks immobilize all hopes of a quick victory had finally foundered in a sea of mud but the race for Tunis and Bizet had not been in vain for our battle lines now stabilized ran south from edges L Bab through so tear fade McNasty and Gaza along the barrier ridge of mountains known as the great dorsal which separated the German occupied coastal plain from the mountainous regions to the west German expansion was possible only through a series of passes traversing the great dorsal and all through the winter months we held those passes against incessant German attack this was the period referred to by the world as one of military inactivity a period during which we sustained nearly half the total casualties incurred during the whole North African campaign that's right when you're reading your papers about lulls that don't apply to Georgie Metcalf and the poor bloody infantry never did we're on the job every night patrols in the hills and in the woods if we go with some friends and tummy

tank it was the present self riding along in a Jeep when we saw mr. Churchill come in not puff his cigar we knew something big was cookin in the small seaside Hotel at Casablanca discussions began at once the purpose to design the shape of victory in Africa and beyond first a meeting was arranged between generals de Gerland Jiro who would succeeded Admiral dollar assassination a month earlier after the meeting was to grow the union of the fighting French who had never lost hope and the French for whom hope had been reborn second the United command for the newton\u00eds M campaign was created the alive troops in the area were now predominantly British but by common agreement generalizing mark as his deputy commanders three British officers general Alexander on land at all Cunningham on see our chief marshal Peter in the air under them British American and French officers and men serving side-by-side the hulls unique and military campaigns third we fixed the terms which would end the fighting unconditional surrender of all these decisions are Russian and Chinese allies were kept fully informed the conference ended the satchel flew on to Tripoli to greet the victorious 8th army and explain its vital part in forthcoming events the decisive are was at hand battle lines were drawn in the north stood the British first Army in the center general Shiraz French troops in the south the Americans further south the small group of fighting French had completed its historic 1500 mile march and taken up positions on the left flank of the British Eighth Army which faced a formidable Mareth line behind which barrier Rommels army after its long retreat had entrenched itself gimnasio was grade with German troops 15 full divisions no scratch troops leaves but battle rise veterans of Poland France components they together with seven Italian divisions were armed with the most modern types of equipment including the newest fighters of bombers the German Luftwaffe the German orders were to missing out all losses keep control of the Mediterranean Wilma was standing behind his matted line saw that he must soon be faced with an attack in the rear from the allied on is among the great dorsal as well as an assault buddy eight on hit man he therefore struck first in an endeavor to remove the Menace behind On February the 14th the blower stuck heavy armored columns burst out of by each person mountain barrier and through into the valley beyond in the face of their onslaught Allied armor withdrew with heavy losses by the 21st the enemy had forced his way through the Kasserine pass and his armored columns were advancing in a three-pronged thrust one main column named the tabasum our supply base in southern Tunisia and another another Keaton in our lines of communication almost within sight of his objective he was 40 American British and French forces all stood in movable against the final impact and in counter-attack Brooke while allied airpower hundred roubles lines of communication and supply the threat was in advancing past destroyed German honor weary occupied gasoline burst and by March the 17th the original battle lines had been restored as soon as almost saw that his westward Trust was doomed he made an abortive attack son against the 8th on the Germans unveiled a new Tiger 10 the British the new 17th under anti-tank gun fifty-two Tiger tanks were left burning huts from then on the initiative was eyes of the various strategies which might now be employed against the enemy General Eisenhower chose one which envisage the entire military situation in terms of a cylinder the western wall allied land forces along the great dorsal the northern and eastern allied air and sea power concentrated in the Mediterranean the sea ports of Tunis and Bizet were to act as the intake valve through which those enemy troops that escaped the devastating attacks of planes and submarines based at Malton would it be sucked into the cylinder at the bottom of the cylinder stood the powerful British Eighth Army to serve as the piston which in its upward stroke would push the enemy into an ever-smaller space still in possession of the enemy were certain high hills to the west of Tunis and lazier their capture was an essential part of the entire strategy for these hills with a sparkplug which when the piston had forced the enemy in was state of my compression would explode combustible mass that was the final strategy to succeed perfect coordination would be necessary between land sea and air forces the northwest african air force commanded by general spots was divided into five major groups of which 3 were combat the strategic air force under general Jimmy Doolittle these were the big boys the long-range bombers pounding away at enemy bases and shipping coastal air force under air marshal boy day and night fighters these protecting ports convoys finally the tactical air force a new conception of air power developed by the British in the Middle East all fighters of attack bombers British and American were placed under one command so that we can strike with the full force of our flying artillery when and where it would do the most good air marshal Cunningham in command of this group a general Alexander in command of all round forces lived and worked side-by-side in a tent camp in the tunisian mountains there's was a complete partnership and in it lay the pattern of ultimate victory by the middle of March stage was set first move was up to where marshal Cunningham the continuous 24-hour so the mayor of fortifications were pounding from the air then general Alexander gave the signal for the piston to begin its upward stroke mangani looking ahead and planned the Mareth battle three months before he would strike after a bath and then we'll mud as a teller men but simultaneously he would begin an unflagging movement on the lift the frontal blow had to cross a gorge the what is exam and create a bridgehead under cover of which tanks and artillery could cross the body before the enemy's counterattack in force could be met three days before the attack a trend heaven next morning our men were holding on like Bulldogs only four tanks had got across but with these and their own arms our inventory kept the bridgehead intact the enemy of fearing another another men now with two armor from other sectors and Floridian once this battle raged on flanking left hook by general Freiburg and his New Zealanders reinforced by the 1st Armored Division was racing across 150 miles of desert towards El Hana the blow was now stuck by 50,000 men on the ground and my bombers fighters and tag Buster's from here the Germans been done by the northumbrian zat minute moved their armor too late the New Zealanders thence forced to be known as the let workers drove through the Mareth line had been turned the piston was on the moon it's speed made possible by the feats in road building with a South African engineer air and naval forces Sheldon bombed all along the seawall our fighters struck at their transport planes still pouring men into the intake valve knocking them out of the sky by the hundreds not land the British first army was a constant threat in the north while in the center of the French had attacked official and further south the Americans have broken through dwell Katara McNasty thus enforcing constant pressure all along the land wall of the cylinder April 7th and American patrols of light tanks striking eastward met patrols in the British 8th army advancing northward we got quite a bang out of meeting these guys 2,000 miles they come fighting all the way yes sir we got a real bang out of it these are the guys that broke the back of the Africa goal still the piston pushed relentlessly on April attempt specs now April 12 suits and on April 20th after exactly 30 days of fighting in pursuit the Eighth Army had driven the enemy into the hills beyond and feet of evil and in its wake was a great homecoming what got me who's watching those religious coming back mostly on little donkeys piled up with so much stuff you'd wonder I carried he reminded me of the Bible somehow you know the donkeys and the hills behind and these folks trekking home it was one old chap spoke a bit of English and he comes up to me and old yarmulke dogs and he says thank you think you think you thank you and then he started shaking hands with us I thought he was never gonna let go and as we watched him going down Neal Jo system he says you know George I had a buddy killed the other day and I was pretty sore about it but now all these four Devils coming home gives the old thing a kind of a meaning well then when we went down to the village it was just the same down there little Jewish boy is taken off the Eurostar's they've been made aware as if they was lepers and then our army doctors a tenant of the women and the youngsters just as if I was on the panel back home I suddenly heard Les Brown door or I certainly did with advance of the 8th army had left the American divisions with Nacional guitar far behind the battle area general Alexander now switched these divisions to the north this remarkable 200 mile march across the heavy traffic streams for the first time his land supply was accomplished without once interrupting these with flow and this and complete secrecy a piston that completed its upward stroke the desired state of enemy high-compression have been achieved now to capture the sparkler the vital hills west of jun-san deserve this led to a number of major battles of which fire were typical bill 609 long saab build Google at Glen Jovan and saw an takuna the 8th army started to fool the French xix corps attack devil Mansell on the Google airplane the British 6th armoured division striking towards Tunis had thrown upon it most of the enemy's remaining on in three days of struggle our main purpose was a company but drawing to this battlefield opponent tanks and guns and their destruction meantime the British 78 division was pressing the attack on long stock for 12 days the hills echoed with gunfire positions were taken lost and retake when the German lines broke up last head lay a hundred son Betty as our infantry went forward engineers and planners build roads across the mountaintops or vital supplies two weeks in 14 days they go 11th mile meanwhile further north the Americans embarked on their place the campaign this started with the assault on Hill 609 long-range artillery started the effect Russians all batter left 8 Baker take you we took Hill 609 that when as many of us guys and we got to the top as they've been at the bottom we took it thus one by one for narnun strong herds in the mountains fell the Germans had been out fort now they were to be outwitted general Alexander knew their fear of the 8th army so he reinforced that fear with heavy bombardments and local attacks from Montgomery's front at the same time he secretly transferred the 4th Indian and the 1st and 7th armored divisions from the 8th to the 1st army in the North whence the main attack was to come spark blood was ours and we were now ready to explode the combustible mass now to pour on the power now to give the apostles of power and education in the use of it British and Americans in the air with everything that could fly red Eastern Americans on the ground with everything that could shoot French artillery French infantry the British Navy Oh port for that concentrated fury it's warfare such as the inventors of the Blitz that never dreamed Nancy's challenge in the free world the fight or surrender was being answered after only eight hours fighting the hard crust of German resistance our armored rash the Americans blitz their way in the Bizet the British smashed right through the center to capture Tunis then a British armored column crashed across the neck of Kate ball to hammamet another British column raced around the tip of the K to prevent any evacuation the whole axis mass was split into four segments the end came quickly by tens by hundreds by thousands they came on foot in trucks and behind their back the greatest mess surrender a fully equipped troops in modern history we had lost nearly 70,000 men dead wounded and missing 35,000 British 18,000 Americans 15,000 French but for every man we had lost the enemy lost fun and at the end 15 full divisions two hundred and sixty-six thousand of their best men laid down their arms knowbut and this no Crete no men riddled with disease and shrunken with hunger fighting to the last barehanded educated in the school for power they were quick to recognize superior power and when they did they quit quit cold this is the end of the axis African adventure after all the rocket he was funny don't joke so quiet yeah what's biting you Joe I don't know I can't help thinking all the hard work that went into those Brent out tanks and half-tracks narrow planes gone for nothing had to be done oh sure it did but still at all think of all the trucks and automobiles and things all that junk might have been I know bloody shame just because he was told that he was a Superman one he never figured things out for herself never argued the toss same as we do too bad he didn't hear some of our arguments of the old dog and Fox back home you know I guess that's the real difference between us and them we argue the toss as you say they don't yeah when you don't argue at us anymore you want our man anymore you're just a blooming tool like a spanner or a sword or a gimmick maybe they like it that way maybe I do but suppose somebody turning you you're me like that germ suppose somebody said put that fellas eyes out or Turner's pipe on that Jew or on that woman would we do it what do you think you and me Joe we may not always think alike but we do think you and me and old Alphonse then the rest we certainly think all right you know joy I got an idea why can't we after the war the same work gang of me keep on swaying together what can we do you mean no more aces and never once have it's chips there isn't a ship and food shows nobody be hungry now move yeah building things up instead of blowing things up like it I don't know like dams in the desert and roads through the jungles maybe is cross all the oceans we could do it I bet you do the jobs at once doing and not the block off anybody who wants to start another or and bring the smiles back to the kids faces all over the world boy I want a job but just now Joe it's the same rough road the same road you Mia just come the same bloody Agra quite a
