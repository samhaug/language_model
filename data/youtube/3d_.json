take the original sonic game and turn it into a new 3d version that video performed really well and it was actually my first video to pass 1 million views which is crazy to even think about so i decided to do the same thing again but this time with an even bigger and arguably better video game franchise the original super mario brothers and since the last video broke my record for 1 million views let's try to make this the video that breaks my record for 100 000 subscribers so uh subscribe the first thing i decided to do was figure out how i was going to make the change from 2d to 3d when remaking sonic i just decided to find a model of classic sonic online but this time i want to try something different old games like super mario bros were made using sprites that consisted of two dimensional pixels but there's actually another form of pixel art that uses the third dimension called voxels which is basically the form that minecraft builds take i've seen voxel art of the old 8-bit mario before and decided to make a game entirely in this art style so the first step was to make a 3d version of all the 2d sprites and oh this is gonna take a while isn't it i started with the running animation since the player will probably be seeing this the most i grabbed three colors for the red green and yellow and started placing blocks down to make the 2d sprite but the problem is that it's still basically 2d so i had to figure out how to make it 3d so i started studying existing voxel art of mario to see how people go about making something into 3d i don't have footage of me messing around with this stuff because it took me hours to do i'm starting to run low on storage space so i'll just jump to the finished models the body on all three of these models were completely different so i had to make them from scratch but luckily the head is exactly the same on all of them so i could just copy and paste it over the next step was to make a model for mario while he's idle now this was a bit weird because no one is stanced up sideways like the chad meme at all times so i had to edit it a little bit his left arm was lower than his right arm so i raised it up to make it symmetrical then all i did was take his head and rotate it the right way and finally the last model that i needed before moving on was mario jumping it was pretty much the same process as all the others so there was really nothing new to show there with all these models complete i was able to start making him move around in the game i started with the idol model and slapped on the character controller that i always use it's a bit weird to just have him running and jumping around while he's in the idle animation so i had to add in the other models i made it so that when mario performs a specific action it'll activate the right model and deactivate the other ones so when mario jumps it changes to the jumping model and landing will go back to normal then when mario is walking it'll start a timer to know when to switch between the three run cycle animations i also made it so that mario has the ability to run when holding the shift key he will run faster and the time between running animations is decreased the next thing i wanted to do was create a little play area for mario to run around in i started by making a couple of textures to represent the different blocks i ended up with five different textures for the ground and other types of blocks i could then use those textures to make materials inside of unity and then apply them to some cubes to make the blocks that i needed for the question block i made a second version of the texture without the question mark so that i could put it on the top and bottom of the cube then i made the little test area of the different blocks i made but mario couldn't interact with anything yet naturally i wanted to start making mario interact with the cubes so i went back and looked at what happened when mario punched the blocks in the original game when mario punches a question block it immediately changes the sprite from a yellow block to a brown block to indicate that it's been hit it also plays a little animation that makes the block jump up a little bit knowing this i started working on replicating that i made an animation using unity's built-in animator to change the y position of the block which is basically just the height then i added a trigger below the block and if mario enters that trigger the block will change materials and play the animation the brick blocks also behave in a similar fashion if mario is small hitting a brick block will make it jump up a bit but that's it it doesn't change materials however if mario is big then hitting a brick block will break it into four pieces so now we have to figure out how to make mario big everyone knows that grabbing a mushroom makes mario bigger so i started making a 2d version of the mushroom next i tried to figure out how to turn that into a 3d model and finally i made it so that i could move along inside the unity then i added a trigger to it so that mario could pick it up and get bigger and yeah that's literally all i did i just made it so that mario gets bigger when he grabs the mushroom it took me hours to make the first few models for mario and i didn't really feel like spending another few hours doing it all over again for a slightly taller mario so instead i just decided to compare the size between mario when he's small and when he's big the small mario is 16 pixels tall and 12 pixels wide and the tall mario is 32 pixels tall and 16 pixels wide this means that mario gets 2 times taller and 1.333333 times wider i tried using these numbers to scale up mario when he's bigger but in my opinion it looks slightly off kind of like skinny mario so i reduced it from 2 times taller to 1.6 times taller and now it doesn't actually look that bad since mario can get big now we can continue working on the brick blocks the old me would have just destroyed the block and called it a day but now i finally started to learn how to use unity's particle system and now i can make cool effects like the cool kids on youtube and the original game the block would break into four circular pieces so i made an effect that breaks the block into four spheres since this is now a 3d game and now it looks a lot better than just making the block disappear since i was in the mood for polishing up the game i also made it so that the question blocks will shine by making the middle aspect of the material ping pong back and forth between 1 and 0. and since i realized i didn't actually have a way of spawning mushrooms yet i made it so that hitting the question box will spawn a preset item the next thing i wanted to do was create the pipes as always i started with a 2d shape first but then i realized i don't know how to make a circle using pixel art so i had to look up how to do that to save time i only modeled one half of it and then i rotated it and mirrored it to create the other half but if i were to stay true to the original design then that would mean having this really ugly looking black outline on the side here it looks fine from a 2d perspective but it doesn't look good in 3d so i changed it to be the normal green color and i also had to get creative when designing the top because obviously you can't see what the top looks like from the original game and with that the top part is now done i did the bottom separately because it can be used to copy and paste and make it into a taller pipe and now with the pipe completely finished i had to make mario enter the plate mario can enter the pipe by crouching in the original game so i made mario crutch by shrinking him down now when he crouches on top of a pipe he gets brought to the center faces the camera and then i turn off collision and camera tracking to make it look like he entered the pipe but he's actually just falling through the world forever then when mario comes out of a pipe i have to re-enable collisions so that he doesn't fall back through with the pipes finished i decided to make the bushes next because they had the same color palette as the pipe unlike the pipe black outline actually doesn't look bad on the bushes so i decided to keep it and there are actually three different versions of the bushes but the only difference between them is that they copied and pasted the small bush a few times to make the larger bushes and by this point i started to realize how much copying tasting the original developers did when making the game like watch this did you know that goombas are just the exact same model as the mushroom but just slightly modified to be able to fit their feet needless to say it wasn't hard for me to edit the mushroom model to make the goomba i even used the same script i used to make the mushroom move to make the goomba move the only difference is i had to make goombas hurt mario instead of giving him a power up and i also quote unquote animated the goomba by mirroring it every few frames to make it look like i was walking the only difficulty i had making goomba was trying to get mario to stomp on it i made a hitbox for mario to jump on the goomba when mario touches the hitbox it's supposed to shrink the goomba and make mario jump a little bit half the time he works as intended but the other half of the time he misses the hitbox and hits the hurt box instead making him take damage i'm still not entirely sure how hitboxes are supposed to work but next up was making the other iconic mario enemy the koopa i realized that the koopa was going to be a lot more complicated to make than the goomba this is because the koopa actually has two distinct animation frames while the shell stays constant the head and the feet change i tried my best converting it to a 3d model and it looks really good but just don't look at it straight on when stomping on the goomba it turns into a shell which will start spinning away when it's stepped on other than that i reused the mushroom script once again to make the koopa move with the enemies finished i think it's time to add the rest of the power ups the next power up i worked on was the fire flower when making the fire flower model i thought about making it look like this first but then i realized that the fire flower in later games doesn't actually look like that so i changed it the interesting thing about the fireflower is that it constantly changes color i did this by simply changing the colors magical voxel and then importing the new versions into unity to get the new materials then i could set it on a timer and swap between the materials every few frames then grabbing the fireflower will also give mario the power up which will change his color as well then i modeled the fireball and made it rotate when it's active then i picked a spawn point in front of mario to shoot fireballs from and now clicking will shoot fireballs out these fireballs will bounce using a physics material and will also destroy any enemies that it touches the last power-up to add now is the star like the fire flower the star will alternate colors and like the fireballs it'll bounce on the ground when mario has to start power up he'll gain invincibility and he'll also change between four different colors one of which is what he currently looks like and then i had him make it so that he will constantly destroy any enemy he comes into contact with at this point i was getting ready to start replicating world 1-1 but there were still a few more things that i needed to add in world 1-1 there's a secret underground section where you can collect some coins i modified the textures i made for the ground block and the brick block to create the bluish underground version of the blocks and then i have all the coins and started placing them around in the original game the coins don't actually spin they just shine but all the 3d games and even super nintendo world show that the coins spin so i decided to just make them spin next i needed to show that mario could collect the coins so i started working on the ui i replicated the look of the ui from the original game using a font i got from google fonts but for now the only thing i'm going to change is the coin count i'll save the score and timer until later in the video the reason being is that we still need to make the iconic end of the level the flagpole in the castle mario gains points at the end of the level based on how high on the flagpole he reached and how much time he had left when he finished the level but first i need to model the flag and the castle the flag was pretty straightforward it was just a sphere on top of a very long 2x2 pole next i made the castle by taking a brick block making a base and then making the top then i made all the little pieces on the castle that stick up and added the yellowish outline to both the top and the bottom and finally i made the doorway in the two windows now to make mario grab the pole i actually needed one more animation model so i decided to just take the jumping model and alter it a bit so both arms and legs look like they're reaching out finally i can make it so that when he grabs the pull he'll slide down and walk inside the castle to do this i made sure that when the bowl is grabbed the collision on the castle is disabled so i place the block inside the castle that will stop mario from completely walking through the castle this block will be important later again when calculating the final score but for now we need to work on the timer the timer is weird because when it shows 400 times left that isn't actually 400 seconds it's 160 seconds because why use something that already exists and works when we could just make our own you can figure out how much time is left by taking what the timer shows and dividing by 2.5 i don't know why that's just how it is with that in mind we can figure out how to calculate how much time is left and make an accurate timer then we can start calculating points mario gains points based on each enemy he destroys he gains more and more points for enemy destroyed if he doesn't touch the ground this is also how he can gain infinite one-ups other ways you can collect points are from the flagpole and the time remaining when finishing the level based on how high mario grabs the pull he'll gain more points in the later games he gets a one-up for touching the ball on the top but in the original he would only get 5000 points then when mario goes inside the castle it'll start giving him 50 points per each unit of time left this is why the block inside is important when mario touches that block the points start adding up and now there's only one thing left to do and that's to start making the levels but i'm only going to be doing world 1-1 in this video i found a picture of the outline of the level and then used that as a basis to start creating i placed blocks and the other stuff that i found and first made a 2d outline then i stretched out the blocks to make it wider and more 3d looking then i started moving things around to make it have more depth than a one block wide level i made a blue texture to create a skybox and made it turn black when you enter the underground level and the result is exactly what you're looking at now i also started testing with other camera angles instead of a third-person camera like this i tried doing an orthographic camera like the one from crossy roads but it was kind of hard to play the game this way ultimately i think the best way to play this specific level would probably be the original 2d perspective but i think this little game serves as a cool playable version of a super mario bros diorama as with all the other games that i remake on this channel i won't be releasing this for obvious reasons but i think it would be cool if nintendo themselves made a 3d game in this style in the future and that's pretty much all i have for this video alright see ya", "hNAbQYU0wpg": "In this video you will experience 5 amazing roller coaster rides in 360 degree interactive.

real to iPhones is it the longer one are the more square one do these look like two different shapes how you like your hot dog ketchup mustard cut it oh hello friends it's me and here's my treat today we're gonna be checking out some 3d pics that looks so real let's play a little game which is real and which is the drawing here we got a whole bunch of Butterfinger slide them up at the table and one remains no but it looks so real I couldn't even tell I would have never been able to tell look at that one of these butterfingers does not butter belong it's like a stain on the table just choose the season it's a pick the fake candy cane which will it be which one of y'all ain't really peppermint who look a little too shiny which one of y'all the Santa used to floss his booty with you know fun fact that's where candy canes came from and just made that up you can't believe everything you hear on the Internet and I have no idea who yes move off and the imposter stay standing it's just the drawing and love is just as real as the original I mean get out of here with your artistic talent too iPhones is it the longer one or the more square one do these look like two different shapes I think the one on the left is the real one Oh yep got them that's pretty good though which one is real and which is paint paint excuse me what all those cookies look very delicious so those are all cookies that ones oh hey it looks like chocolate paint is not allowed to look about delicious but still dip my cookies in it bone Apple teeth we sleeping in the ER tonight place they should controller I should know this the one on the left looks real yes I was like it's too shiny the black is just right oh man look at all that detail and effort put into this for the sake of fooling your friends okay I'm starting to think everything on the right side is fake you can't fool me you ain't even swishing up the sides oh my god is actually really just I saw it breathing and that I'm like it's a great alert I thought it was like a plushie or something how is them so still while you drive no stumble on my mind another holiday tests which Santa's the fake one I'm gonna say it's the badly drawn one on the right like look his eyes look a little off maybe they're doing that to fool me which will it be oh wait I was right like those eyes they look a little off Oh what the rest of it looks basically identical except you'll get the paper poops if you eat one of them is that a thing does that happen when you eat paper I've only tried paper once it was when I was a kid and I was like really scared cuz somebody told me if you eat paper you'll get like lumps in your throat or in your stomach so I was just like you know what that's pretty scary so I just like took a little piece I crumpled it up and then I don't do that don't do it to this day I still suffer there we got two eggs we have to guess which one is the real egg which one is the fake egg which one's the vegan one I'm gonna go with the one on the left the one on the left doesn't look like it came from a chicken oh yeah see I was right fake egg versus real egg Oh see they try to pull up all switch-a-rooney with me how you like your hot dog ketchup mustard cut it oh the one on the left was the real one y'all thought you could fool me by putting real ketchup a real mustard on both of them I love me a gluten-free hot dog delicious they drew a tomato oh we even got the light reflecting on it the same kind of way to the shadows they're like identical light look at this picture just looking at this you would never know the one on the left is an impostor when you call an imposter tomato Atta monster mmm juicy AF getting harder now give to popsicles the one on the right looks more frosty like they just pulled that bad boy out of the freezer you on the left you an imposter sickle wait the one on the left is real they drew that it looked so real it looks more real than the real popsicle but time will tell who is truly victorious all right we're testing cans which can is real let's just fake I think it's one of the coca-cola I don't trust them I don't trust the one on the the second to the left kick them all out of the way who will emerge victorious in this battle of squished cans oh yeah see I knew it I knew it okay so there's a bunch of matches and only one of them is real no they drew half of the matches the whole second half is just a drawing no way man this video is just blowing my mind it's not just me I want you to stop take a look at these matches smash like if they all look legit it looks like one or two are drawing on like the middle ones but the rest of them y'all see that oh now you see they they did me a bamboozle they only do three of them in the middle and then the rest of them were real okay y'all got me there but that was pretty good which three leaves are drawn there's not even fair there's so many of that I think the first one in the middle closest to the fan the one on the top in the middle and then the one right under maybe hmm my guess I'll turn on the fan reveal yourself leaf pasta all of them Wow okay I can't even tell I feel very foolish I don't want to play this game anymore I keep getting them prop up the tootsie roll test I don't even know where to start with these there's just so many of them oh oh my god I got it I got it I know which one it is I can't really point it out to you guys but I see it you guys see which one is fake smash like one of them looks a little too perfect yes I was correct I have found the roll of Lies or another ice cream [Music] seems this was a battle against time and the left has melted in that waffle detail making me hungry okay everything on the right side is fake hopefully oh no they've puzzled me on this one they switched it up the one on the left side this time is fake when you which nope rope is real it's a real snitch I don't think it was real Matheny we got a chance to guess before you so rudely interrupted with your slithering around hey I can make a hand turkey too oh are you guys making a 3d hand all right watch this cuz this gets wild how they do this so this is how you do you like trace out the shape it looks like the hand is coming out of the paper I'm too scared haven't you seen that episode of Spongebob when he made doodle bob you traveling in the wrong world so this is how you draw a 3d ladder you know just make a line and another line the how you freehand the straight line Mac a barely freehand I can barely draw a straight line and they drawn this whole polygon diagonal lines that everything lines up perfectly straight [Music] so they're drawing the ladder and the shadows that the latter makes then you fold the paper what no that's legal how did it go look Oh fold it and then move the camp and it's just at that certain angle it looks like it's 3d step one take a paper that's what you did to my mind they made a sphere a ball if you will look 3d on paper to try to fool their dog No how did it go in this is some voodoo magic right here it went in the hole y'all see that I'm not crazy it went in the hole that's what she said but also know what's the drawing you can't do that she's just like that episode of Spongebob be careful what you draw or it might come true this M defies the laws of physics so this is how they did it you just draw a 3d M slightly curved oh I love it you know once upon a time a long time ago I used to be artists and that's how I like to shave every time I do my pencil drawing or we get like a tissue and I would just rub it that's how you make the shading look boneless see so satisfying so basically it's just curving it see it looks like it curves but this is how we did it he cut the piece of paper so that it looks like it's standing off of the paper look at that that's not natural that's illegal I swear it's like lifting off of the paper but it's not it's flat making my head hurt it looks like I could go down that ramp and do a 360 kickflip if I even know how to do that this is like the same concept but with a a the first you start out with a simple line drawing of a 3d a but slightly curved then fill it in shade it in don't forget the shadow everything 3d has a shadow so this is what it looks like when you fold it and then when you angle it just you see how it just stands straight up like it's been given life it's no longer a letter I am honestly creeped out how cool this is how it just shifts depending on how you look at it is up and standing that ain't got better posture than me anyways that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you didn't want a part to make sure you get that like vitala comment below did you get most of them right or wrong and make sure you turn on notifications click click I subscribed you're the wolf pack I love you guys so much neck stretching bye guys", "BdxYYMbbm5Y": "i took all the levels in world 3 and rotated them by about 45 degrees harmless slopes became impossible walls ambassadors became extremely glitchy let's get started [Music] welcome back to another day in modded 3d world i know how i haven't done this sooner to be honest but it's kind of glorious i had a little look through some of the levels i had to look through all the levels but i didn't finish all of them they're actually kind of hard i tried doing the ice clutch but like you just kind of it's gonna go most of these are changed on the z-axis i think there's one i put on the x-axis but yeah most of them are on the z-axis they're gonna be big uphill climbs like this and oh my god it's very interesting to see what rotates and what doesn't like the brick blocks they rotate but the question blocks don't but the snow on the question blocks do bitty buds paths rotate so they're going in in a rotated direction but the bitty birds themselves don't nothing actually has like a wall collision is just based on the slant entirely and like mario kart which has wool and floor collision so i can just walk up the walls until like you hit an invisible wall but that's something i get and then you can slide back down them there's the goomba shoe which doesn't really skate up unless you spam the jump button and then it just slowly slides back down this entire thing is just so cursed uh and then there's the slope which is now normal because that makes sense i hate it i i mean i love it but i hate it so much like why what even is that i don't even know how to commentate this dude just made this quick little mod it's like okay let's get a quick video out aiming to get this a little bit after my paper mario video because i know the paper mario video will underperform but how do i even how do i even beat this oh just walk up oh no i fell in the hole always fine [Music] bye what does this pipe do this video is just going to be full of nonsense like i usually like when i do these mods i play them in advance so i can like think of how i'm going to commentate it but i don't even know like i've played through some of these levels and i didn't even know what to say i mean these flagpoles are broken i mean all i can say is that a video in which i'm way more coherent in my speech and i talk about how the flagpoles work okay so world 3 has two order score levels for the first one i decided to remove the order score and have it slanted and the second one i kept the order scroll to see what would happen so um we're going to be doing both of course chain link charge is the one where i remove the auto scroll this one actually it plays like a genuine level minus a few things these platforms are incredibly annoying i tested all these with mario but i soon realized i should probably record the video with rosalina because it was really difficult to actually bypass these platforms i think the cat 2 might actually be a hindrance yeah i can't even climb this i can walk down here and then i can just wait for the platform and get on it i feel like this is not how the stage should be played under any circumstance but whatever i guess please just get up also when the bricks are slanted you can't actually hit them for some reason what's cool is the death areas are also diagonal the death areas are going to be in the same place which means we can still like fall down the same amount and it will be a-okay i don't even know how to do this part i think i'm just going to climb up onto the wall and then like oh no oh oh what the hell even though the donut blocks are like all slidy i can't do anything here i need to try and get on here yes okay good and now let's try and get up here get on the platform good uh uh no i don't know if i like it better or worse without the cat suit maybe worse honestly yeah also we're doing world three because i always pick world one for these i was like let's try walk through just time god i'm gonna do everything i can to beat these levels i know a lot of you guys don't care for paper mario so i gotta make this video good and stop talking about meta stuff and talk about the game for new people haven't seen me before hi this is rosalina she's he's blue guided i saw i can't do this the thing is right these these walls it's kind of hard to put it into perspective because everything's slanted but these walls are like they're beyond 90 degrees at this point the game is seen in the ceilings that's why it's pushing me back so desperately and i'm not getting any height when i jump next to them oh my god i can i can see the other section that's something at least you know come on my yes okay progress i want to try and get to the screen star as well i feel like that's a necessity i i do find it like kind of a cool mechanic climbing up the panels like this i actually kind of like that kind of unique talking of unique that korean style is very much so i shouldn't risk this but i want to know if i can just like skip over to the other side oh i can very nice i think you can do that in the vanilla game as well please no when i was testing this i spent ages trying to like get past here because remember all of these red platforms the way they're slanted their ceilings now then i realized why are you long jumping oh well fine apparently i realized that we could just go on here and go over here and just climb this up and you can even go on this and then you just get to the top it's lovely and that's as far as i got i i couldn't get past the section so now we're going to get past the section for the first time together it's going to be great though the clouds didn't rotate their positions kind of like changed it was very very weird these clouds are capable of rotating after all they literally rotated down there we saw them earlier so i don't really know how spotlight decided what was going to rotate and what wasn't oh my god oh oh my god the cat suit is a blessing right now yeah i think i i kind of prefer having it having the platform so simple here it actually made that section pretty fun anyway let's uh let's hit the oh i feel like that's not quite right oh there's a little area down here that's nice oh i should move all right let's climb to the top of that that's definitely how that should work just so you know guys my next project my next uh serious project isn't like a meme like this is like so massive you're gonna love it next up is shifty boo mansion and i gave up this one really quickly but now i got rodalina so it should be a bit easier so one thing i noticed when i rotated this the graphics are uh definitely seeing areas were not meant to like what what what even is this i think a tool we're gonna have to use here is the uh the manga filter that kind of lets us see the outlines a bit better get rid of all like the uh the fog either manga or neon both are really helpful tools i think manga is a bit more useful pencil sketch is also quite useful okay so i'm approaching the first staircase you can't get up the staircase the staircase is like a wall i don't know why it's kind of like a ceiling slash wall but luckily with the catsuit it looks like i can climb it which is cool because i didn't have the cat suit when i tested this before so i never actually got past this point oh my god what's even stopping me okay so i think i'm on the conveyor right now yes i'm on the i'm on the conveyor right now can i go in the painting okay i can oh yeah so what's in oh my god this camera is atrocious it's so bad i don't even know okay apparently i got it i didn't even know it was there oh no no no no come on i'm gonna have to keep doing this i just have no idea where i am at any point getting to the sofa that's the sofa i was trying to ride the sofa up game on the sofa there we go [Music] nice can we go in the diagonal door yes we can okay finally the fog is gone the camera is still atrocious but at least the fog's gone oh my god what the hell what is this nonsense okay let's try and ride this up to go to white green star 2 normally lives i don't even know where i am oh yeah green star 2 is down here i thought it was down here anyway there it is got it okay that's the ceiling so we've got to climb those absolutely what's stopping me okay i don't know what stop what is this oh my god oh my god please i need a lot of help okay just get up here cool i like this get me up and away oh oh i get the cat suit that would have been a useful resource but whatever stop oh we can just go up here it's fine how high can i go okay i can go quite high pretty cool i guess all right mission do anything but what i just did no no no no okay i'm gonna do it from the block do it from the block i feel safer from the block okay this also looks kind of sand i like that oh hello this is so trippy you never know what's going to work in what kind of way you know this why is this top down i'm like approaching the end i think yes oh i just need to use the fake pipe oh no no no i can't even find the exit okay that's the exit just get out okay forget the green star dude i've had enough stay away no no no no no no no oh my god just get me out that was horrific okay here we are pretty plus oh wait i need to get the first one don't i yes so this cloud is rotated but the other okay whatever it could be easier to take some of these shortcuts at least that's kind of cool i forgot to play it peach so i'm just going to go to the switch and come back thrilling these cannons work really weird the animation works but then like when it launches you just yeah here we are at the cloud i guess collision is just a social construct oh there we go oh my god what i don't want to go back pipeline lagoon let's go these lads dude i thought they just stayed on the surface of the water because when we removed the water i seem to recall they died i don't know he seems to be doing all right to me this game is so stupid and why is that so blue here i guess it's trying to use the underwater lighting don't know why i am under the water there's just a guy just chilling here interestingly the clear pipes work at these weird rotations though it's nice to know that i can rotate them at these weird angles if i want to and with this i can just go through and it still works that's quite nice to know playing through the underwater section until you get to the surface just wrapped it there it actually felt quite nice felt like a new section especially with the question block not being rotated it was really cool and also some guy i just got a notification on obs that someone she had 10 bits on my twitch i'm not live right now am i live right now honestly the rest of this level speaks for itself hey i'll speed it up for you let's make a compromise this game is so weird dude also look at the length of the long jump you get on slope like what the hell [Music] nothing about that was correct i'm actually i'm going to put off mount mustache because that one is really difficult first of all let's go here switchboard falls this one amazed me when i made my supermassive remake uh making the rails work was really difficult but they were so strict with how they worked so i thought this would break for sure but apparently not like what how is that how is this working uh then the tr then the track should stop working though bye am i tilted it almost looks normal the the amazement of snapshot mode i guess all right my planet needs me see you later dude look at this oh you can come up here whoa what the hell okay that doesn't have collision about what i expected to be honest i remember we did this in mario kart wii a while ago and that was really disorientating but this is like potentially even worse okay so i think it's pretty obvious what the problem is here so like how high can i go here i'm trying to work out what's the best way to retain my height here i'll be honest guys i don't think this is it yeah that was extremely unsuccessful and go down here i don't want that though i'm too tired to be doing this recording guys i got no sleep last night again i don't really have to commentate this one this one's movement-based also nice lighting anyway so this is piss circuit dream minecraft would love this one uh the slopes are again just ceilings that's fantastic thankfully rosalina should make it possible to bypass these this is nice to see it's nice to see that when these are angled they'd shoot you in that direction i i would never abuse this in a troll level for zx many i would never abuse those i i might not i i haven't decided yeah you've got this thrilling part where we have to bounce off of these guys i got to the checkpoint and then gave up so that this should be interesting this bit's weird because this actually has slope collision but like it's evidently not a slope but notice how it's going downhill right not having it dude how how is that uphill what does this get like how how is that uphill i think it's sort of no it's oh my god just [Music] and now we have this this is nice isn't it oh my god now stop we're gonna have to do the unthinkable 90 degree wall jumps dude all right let's do it it's really awkward at this angle to do them i can't even tell what wool i'm going off half the time hopefully please please shut up so to please no oh it's so hard new idea didn't work oh the strats this is way better oh my god they're actually working oh my god it's working oh no no no no please oh it worked oh my god yes all right then do this again no no no come back no no no no no please get the perfect jump for this to work otherwise it just won't let you have it maybe it'll settle for a spin jump maybe that'll give me the distance that it requires oh oh god okay what about the stamp do we have the stamp dude i actually made these normal this is lovely this is the only nice part about the entire level now for the slope it's just perfectly flat i low-key wanna like try and like actually wait wait wait stop i have a cat suit i have a cat suit stop no that's not what i wanted to use the cat suit for all right whatever let's just take this warp box i don't i don't even know how we're gonna do this part i think we're gonna have to okay we can we'll jump lucky me we might be able to get away with using the signposts again which was a lot easier than using the wall so i have to use the wall a little bit i think [Music] no you do not know how hard i was concentrating that oh why are you going rosalina [ __ ] wait wait no please are you coming no no ho ho ah [Music] that's gonna be harder than i thought i think i'm gonna release this level on game banana like i'm gonna trying to touch it up a little bit and release it on game banana because it's actually a really cool like kaiser challenge level the other levels are kind of memey but this is actually like a genuinely good challenge you know what okay i'm going to run a random number generator if i get a one i have to try and get the stamp if i get two i'm not going for it god damn it oh wait wait wait wait hang on hang on no that slope keeps going down oh you can so do that i didn't realize that like the edge was also a slope okay i can do that so i reckon if we come down here yeah okay it'll let me stand here which should mean that i can do this yes oh my god okay i'm so happy i tried that i'm not doing that ever again that's not even possible it is possible oh it's finally over freedom please freedom oh all right so the channel was actually really interesting so we're gonna finish with that one for now let's go to histogram all right so histocrat is i mean he's histocrate if you've seen me messing with bosses before you'll probably find this one i'm using camera pans over we're ready to see him let's go histocrat oh there he is he's the sideways snake hello sir how you doing not very well it seems he realized maybe this isn't the way i'm gonna go back up front i think yes how are you minions doing sir hmm what no did that i'm gonna dive from the top because i want i wonder what will happen i can i can come here right yeah what's the game going to think of it if i just kind of go for a little dive right here i'll probably won't like it very much i'd imagine yeah anyway let's not go for the cat suit since that's a scam i can stop you can still see him didn't even go under the ground properly dumbass all right let's head inside the pipe you know one of my biggest complaints with this level was how easy it was to see so i'm i'm really glad they got the high end out but now we're going to go to the best one what happens when you put an auto schooler and keep the order scroll and tilt it all and more importantly how does the train react can the train go up hills what's gonna happen to the train well i'm not seeing the train yet doesn't look like the camera rails are rotated hmm seems a bit fishy all right not seeing much signs of a train can't move the camera around to look for it ah looking around i don't really see much signs of a train um oh there it is yeah i'm messing with you there it is again it just kind of leaves bye just like this video", "F93AmHzRYPg": "[Music] you know that imma keep it cold with you i feel

scissors if you win you get to go back to using your right hand if you don't win you're stuck with it rock paper scissors shoot [Music] rock paper scissors shoot all in all i think they're doing okay i'm just not sure if they're gonna have enough time to finish but yeah we'll see we have some fun challenges coming up time for a mini challenge roll to see what you have to do and multiply it by one 20 jumping squats 20 times four 80 burpees eight minutes of links there's nothing mckenzie you have 75 crunches [Music] jake jess are you too tired of using your left hand yet all right so you can stop if you beat me in this game of rock paper scissors rock paper scissors shoot rock paper scissors shoot rock paper scissors shoot i'm dying [Music] currently 2 a.m michelle and i are still up yes i am done with mr bacon cutting into it i did all of this for nothing so i'm back it's 7 51 in the morning i just made grogu's little chip so he's gonna be in there she's been up since four o'clock in the morning and she got up and started working at what six and this is all i've gotten done eight o'clock in the morning and i'm still working on my little chameleon and he's looking a little lonely so i'm gonna put this by next to him all right so as you guys know it's the next morning you guys have five minutes left jake it looks like you still have a lot to do in this basket garogu like flies around oh very impressive mackenzie oh my goodness you chopped your dragon yeah what happened so my prediction was that mackenzie's was gonna look really really good [Music] ten nine eight seven six five four three two one time is up good job everyone all right so i think it looks really really cool i like how it's interacting with its environment i would say however would have been kind of cool to see a little cricket over here or fly very impressed with your creeper i can't believe you made an entire barn that is that's really good and then you have these little blocks good job so i really like the attention to detail especially the pinks in the face the cheeks especially good job jake and finally mackenzie definitely a lot of attention to detail has a tongue in here that is very cool i like i like how you have a lot of different colors on here you have spikes great job but with that being said only one of you will win before i start eliminating people jake yours is the only one that isn't complete i'm sorry jake unfortunately i feel like compared to the other contestants yours had a little less volume a little more see-through you are eliminated and this is actually kind of interesting michelle you placed your bet on mckenzie so either way you're getting money so win win for me mackenzie who did you bet i bet on jake since this is a very close match up i'm gonna let my subscribers chase the results are in i feel bad i wish both of you could win but the winner is any guesses mckenzie now what happens is get to play me rock paper scissors you have five tries each time

ladies and gentlemen we are opening up a clan chest right now i got 1200 coins which is like super awesome you know anyways please make sure to drop a like subscribe and turn on post notifications if you haven't done so yet i really would appreciate it if you guys could and yeah please make sure to join my discord server link in description we'll be doing more giveaways there and all you guys have to do is subscribe and that's literally all you guys have to do you know also subscribe to my second channel hmz if you have done so yet and i've also hidden a weapon in today's video and if you guys really want to help me out please consider purchasing a membership you know i'm not asking for much it's only two dollars so i really would appreciate it if you guys want me to do more giveaways all you guys have to do is just watch my ads until the end but let's get into today's video also congrats on soul cellar for finding yesterday's hidden weapons yeah just keep your eyes peeled for today's hidden weapon but without further ado let's get into today's video all right so first off we're in my third account right now we're just going over some cool weapons so i do recommend getting those really cool op weapons you know in the armory first if you're gonna start off with any cool weapons if you're free to play player best game modes to grind are actually co-op block crashing any sort of mini game basically because not many pro skill players do play i mean there are some really crazy grinders and blocks crash but you guys can always do the parkour glitch it's easy free to do and super simple so i recommend getting the earth spike um just some really good heavies the earth spike and anti-gravity blast are pretty good also the one punch gauntlet's pretty good if you're free to play player and have enough income i would recommend getting the one punch gauntlet if you haven't done so yet and are on my devoted light account currently so yes so the pre historic shotgun and the mini gun shotgun are pretty good starter primaries if you guys don't have viking acid shotgun chickaboom or ultimatum champion mercenary is actually pretty decent for backup tests but i recommend getting thunder laser cycle you can get laser cycle for a thousand gems in the gallery so technically every player is free to play with coupons i guess in some sort of glance if you think about it guys elder force sabre is pretty good it's a pretty awesome melee if you guys are going to try three cat spam or just doing melee zones or anything you want to do with a melee primal beast is actually amazing it was actually currently it was in a trader van also i recommend getting the deadly b i actually used to use that weapon a lot anti-gravity i used to use that a lot in like public matches and duels because it's just easy weapon to use i don't know there's just something about the weapon and yes i'm gonna collect my coupons one day you'll have to see when i'll collect my coupons on this account what's up glitchy what's up dude anyways so i recommend using the daily stuff if you guys didn't know this existed yes this exists just check your store and using the black market to your advantage you guys can join devoted light devoted x if you guys want to join just join our discord server black market's probably one of the best places to go and get stuff so i just got the zeus chain sword today which is pretty awesome i'm actually always on that melee on this account i don't know why there's just something about it you know it's like a greek related weapon so i obviously have to get something based off of greece you know all right so we're in a private game and of course up to hermes that's a dude's name all right so this is like all weapons from the armory basically besides viking you can get viking for a thousand coupons or if it comes back in an event so yeah probably beast is actually 100 recommended it's pretty good heavy if you don't have any heavies like destruction system demo exo christmas ultimatum but you can get those sort of weapons with gallery coupons but if you don't have enough coupons i recommend getting these weapons i'm showing in today's video you don't have to get them of course i'm not forcing you to get them but i'm just suggesting because this is today's recommended video about free to play because someone devoted light was like hey i need help i really need a free to play videos like all right sure i'll do it why not so poison darts is actually pretty good if you guys don't have it i recommend getting it also if you guys just noticed i bought a spell a special spell for 1700 coins and i didn't get anything out of it i just wanted to address that that is so weird and that's a stupid glitch that just occurred i don't know why i don't know like i thought i would buy this spell it's just a melee you know yeah definitely a melee it's special and i don't know the game didn't recognize that i bought the thing for like 1700 coins so now i have to go to like pg support or like talk to someone about this because i caught that on recording and it's so dumb because i bought for 1700 coins and it's just like my coins just disappeared i don't know i don't know what i bought man i swear i pressed by and it just didn't give me anything that was just super weird anyways uh the dark force saber is pretty good as well i do recommend getting this i used to main this melee a lot using jetpack and uh shurikens is pretty good too but thunder is probably one of the most recommended backups in this game it does so much damage you know i'm just saying and having it as mythical or with like super good modules it's pretty good and promising in this game earth spike overseer's pretty good sniper you don't have to get this sniper for a thousand coupons uh i recommend aiming for like portalium rifle heavy sniper rifle harsh punisher those types of weapons in the trader van i'm just saying that some of the best weapons in this game are from like battle passes events or traitor vans i'm just saying not all of the best weapons are in like the armory besides poison darts it's one of the best specials in this game but like i'm just saying like all the good weapons guys you have to make sure you save your income and stuff for like trader vance i mean the armory doesn't have bad weapons but what i'm saying is this just make sure to save your income be smart with what you buy and make sure glitches don't happen to you like what happened to me i bought something for 1700 coins and i never got the weapon yeah that's pretty bad guys don't don't end up like me who didn't get the weapon that's just so weird i don't know what to say to this anymore anyways i recommend aiming for like gallery weapons as well digital sunrise you can get necklace of the ice king if it comes back in a trader van it probably will come back again it was just in a lottery it was in a super chess and you could have got it for like 500 coupons anyways if you guys did enjoy this video all you guys have to do is drop like subscribe turn on post notifications of course join my discord server link in the description leave a comment down below anyways i'll see y'all later [Music] you", "0tuIHoYPwj0": "hey there before we continue with this video make sure you are subscribed to the channel and you have bail notifications for all uploads hello everyone for this one we'll be showcasing a 3d print done by the talented crazy aries he has a youtube channel please subscribe it takes a few seconds now at the time of this recording he did not publish the extinct phoenix video if he does publish it i will link uh the original video but he does have a youtube channel he does cool 3d print content like this uh please show him some love and show some support so i am going to let out my bias in this video i love phoenix phoenix is one of my favorites out of all the chozies it's cool fi is awesome so as a sparking it's super cool so first let's go over the weight now let's also address something else he did make little insert tabs uh for the phoenix chip uh just to give it the weights and you're gonna be like okay but what are you actually talking about let's first weigh the thing i did give it a metal chip core obviously i can't actually print in metal uh so what do we get to about 56.26 so you know that is okay so the idea with this is that the ring is the armor so if i just try to pop it out which i probably could uh it it's just awesome man the idea that the armor is connected uh to the ring is just really really interesting i'm just gonna try to there we go so this is how it looks like it's probably just do it like this because there's no shadow easier so this is what it looks like without the thing obviously it is uh not protected i am worried about these little tabs here because they're fragile but uh that is the whole idea with these extinct ring i don't know how easy it will be or how hard it'll be for it to actually fly off in the video but uh it's cool it's a cool idea the idea that it's also connected to the ring i just found so fascinating like how like in all honesty how could tt actually do it like it's a hard thing to answer like could they do it where it was like how crazy aries did it but it wouldn't make too much sense they'd probably have to do something really crazy on it but yeah it's awesome so let's first do a test launch so the combo is the exact one that he made for it 1d sting friction if they ever end up making a phoenix and it better be owned by phi i will go insane for it just phoenix is one of my favorites oh also at the end it will have a small small announcement so stay tuned for that all right so makes sense so let's put this up against something so we got phoenix launched let's try rage big hits but phoenix is coming back rage is not going to stop it i kind of wondered too if phoenix would have metal on the armor if it did go on sparking or if it would just be how would they do it because i think that was rage but phoenix is like such a relevant bay like seriously relevant that it is honestly crazy to see how long it's last which is also why i wonder how they would evolve it oh my god blow for blow on rage right now i would kind of just want the phoenix armor too just to be compatible with only that evolution like i don't want it to be like if you buy the sparking phoenix you can make the perfecter phoenix you know like something silly like that uh though it would be kind of funny like the even more perfect phoenix you got that reference i appreciate it uh next up let's go up against fafnir because five battled against freeze so i thought it would be really fun dude just like i love phi is maybe not the most complex character but he's so fun oh wow they really rage really did twist it on the thing i think rage would have been the first one where the armor actually uh comes out all right hold on we just there you go let me just put the armor on yeah so rage almost got the thing sliding out so good on there we might put in this right that's so weird yeah it it moved the chip but how did it move the chip like that so dude rage hit the thing but it also tilted the chip that is really weird uh anyways uh let's try fafnir so i'll do phoenix first and phoenix is perfectly fine it's going to be a fafnir probably so rage was super close to getting the armor off now i don't even know if the armor will come off in the video but if it does i'll be sick because then after i get to showcase the gimmick i kind of just like i know it'll probably come off but i kind of just hope it stays on because i'm afraid of the chip getting hit yeah fair enough to be honest it is friction right like friction i wonder how would they just repeat friction if they evolved again look at that see it tilted the armor so fafnir was another one that got close so here's what's weird it's that it tilts the chip so i don't even is it tilting the arm or is it just the chip that's what i'm trying to wonder something looks okay i have no idea i'm just going to assume this thing is just tied on oh easy there phoenix wait uh other way i think it was the other way around the other way around this thing is just tight on all right well i got it on right now so perfect hey shout out to world spring big up it's in this weird thing where it's twisting the chip oh no no it is it is just pushing the armor a little bit and when it seems let me just double check the chip is chip looks perfectly fine actually the chip it i'm just double checking on this stuff just because i am printing this on the right side let me see if i put it on like this oh yeah no this thing is put on right it is it is all right let's get it launched another ko by the sprogan i don't know how much this will actually win but i'm curious let's i'll do spriggan in a second but i want to try something like joker so i feel like let's give joker like a tip where it's not going to kill itself but in a second let's give joker like revolve doesn't matter double o turn revolve okay so what i'm curious with is how phoenix will take the blow we might even get a case where the army i feel like that might be the case in the thing probably just means uh for the print actually the thing was yeah the teeth are fine and the snoops on the thing you're fine how is the chip even rotating how does that oh cause it's okay the chip is rotating i keep on forgetting it's not a normal ring it's rotating because it's not locked on like a sparking ring oh that makes sense everything looks right on the thing all right okay so that makes sense i was wondering like why isn't the thing coming off all right that gives a logical explanation i thought for a second like the chip broke or something and it was just tied on all right well this tanked joker so i think we'll give it a a good pass there so my overall thoughts on the phoenix so far is really cool really curious to see how much it can pull off in the video all right glide ragnarok this is the real test it's gotta beat up wide it doesn't meet up wide and i don't know probably just need a hard enough impact for the armor to come out i don't really mind too much reminds me of kind of like hasbro where the the phoenix for hasbro uh the armor rarely came out compared to tt so we're going to be glide without a doubt i want to see how we're going to be wide so it's attacking right now but what's gonna happen okay we've got it set up here so we're gonna launch phoenix now i i figured out a trick right as long as i loosen up the armor a bit it can come out and that is the trick to the phoenix okay that is kind of funny though hey i got the armor out let's go all right see we're gonna do a sequel now achilles killed the phoenix well that's how the video ends off that's perfect actually this is this is iger's revenge no i was gonna do more but uh wow so achilles really just slapped it out of phoenix didn't it all right well don't worry dorian i have i have a i have something we can fix with this where's the hyperion 2 chip all right don't worry hyperion 2 will take its place it will avenge it yeah no i mean i i expected this to happen in the video i mean i've been leading on to it i'm like is the chip okay how's that chip dear god how's the chip you know that is okay that is okay well i mean it should still work the same way either way don't i don't really think anything's gonna really change for the video though it was a little bit funny all right let's let's try it again let's try it again now if the hyperion chip breaks after this um this is on infinite achilles bill now i don't care if it won i just want to know if i beat up the hyperion did it beat the hype here in it uh it did not beat up the hyperion so we are good i am a wee bit worried so i'll i'll only do one more one more after this i'll do one against brave all out this is extinct hyperion in one hand in one hand okay yeah either way this thing is fire so i mean the chip thing was funny because like i always know that the chips it's just sparking's design it's nothing with crazy aries design but the sparking chips are fragile so it happens right it happens it's kind of funny that achilles was the one that did it in a way you know it sucks because i gotta eventually reprint the chip but uh i guess iger got his revenge after all so i don't think would actually break a bay wouldn't be in character but whatever thank you for watching and have an amazing day", "f00nnw1XyCo": "hey you guys do you love watching those nozzle close-up videos with the printer running in today's video we will show you how you can easily install a camera to capture those nozzle images on the creality and their 3 or ender 3 pro you want to know more then stay [Music] tuned hi guys welcome back my name is rui and this is the reraptor youtube channel if you want to help us out you can by giving this video a like and subscribe the channel you can also help by joining our patreon page or by clicking on any of the affiliate links posted below in the video description so nozzle close-up shots are always cool to watch these images are amazing and are great to include in video presentations and in some cases they can help to troubleshoot issues or even to calibrate the machine there are lots of great cameras for the job and for this tutorial we bought this endoscope camera at a local store this particular model can connect to a pc tablet or mobile phone and there are several cable lengths available if you plan on connecting the camera to a pc you might want to buy one with a long cable so it can easily reach the computer but if you want to connect to a raspberry pi for example then a short cable length will be better this camera is eight millimeters in diameter and 45 millimeters in length and it's equipped with eight small leds around the camera lenses at the other end it has a usb connector with multiple formats and a type c adapter this same connector can be used with a computer tablet or smartphone next to the usb connector it has this small controller that allows to adjust the led light intensity on the market you can find different cameras with different resolutions to secure the camera on the printhead we designed this support mount the plan was that it was easy to install and that we could adjust the camera's position we will include the links for the stl files in this video description so don't forget to check them out and this is one of them this is the smaller version of our camera mount we also designed the second one that it's a bit taller and it has these two openings to secure the camera's cable the installation is super easy basically we need to remove the screws that secure the print head cover attach the support mount and screw back the screws okay so let's go to it remove the two screws that secure the printhead cover for the assembly we will need a couple of m3x8 screws because the stock ones are too short but we can use one of the stock screws on the support mount to secure the camera then we take the support mount and place it over the print head cover and then we use the new screws to secure both the mount and the cover and that's it the support mount is installed now for the camera just insert the camera and adjust the position you will need to have it connected and check the image to find the correct position and also the camera angle then carefully tighten the screw to secure the camera move the z down and make sure the camera is higher than the nozzle and finally move the x carriage left and right to confirm that everything moves freely and that the camera cable does not get caught in the process if you use the second design you can secure the cable on the mount it will be easier to arrange the cable this way and the installation is now complete you can now start your print and start recording the camera has its own illumination leds and you can adjust its brightness but if the image gets too bright or the illumination is not enough you can add external illumination to fix that and if you have a raspberry pi running octoprint you can connect the camera directly to the raspberry pi and get the image from there and record time lapses with it and that's it you guys we told you it was an easy installation hope you liked the video and don't forget to give it a like feel free to leave your comments below in the video description we will see you guys

thought it was dream but it was it i think it's jimmy vote him out our jack the fact that you keep doing that is sucks we can't like dream dine vain though i mean we gotta vote george right no no stop stop stop don't wait is that danny saying that that is me saying that yeah uh yeah you would say that it's wild captain george no it is not me it's not me all right i'm not a george i no don't vote me

was dream me and you were together sap and chandler just left us i don't think chandler killed someone at that time it is either danny or wildcat it's both telling you it's danny it is absolutely not me danny pushed both those votes okay if i was imposter i would not push that hard let's do danny and if it's not danny we do no no no no no do vodka first it's on boys oh let's see it where are we right oh um jimmy no bro hey guys you guys call it emergency meeting dream this is your fault i need to call an emergency meeting wait how many how many are there run run oh run run run oh wait there's the wave was chandler and the wildcat i get i guess i'm third imposter now i actually have a positive story let's do it all right i'm imposter oh my god it's me and mr beast nobody kill me leave me alone leave me alone i'm just a lonely little guy just doing my thing is it mr beast is it jimmy the lights let's go lights murdered on the lights panel dude come on look at me dude oh no lazy just saw me oh wow why did i see cyan running away from lights really oh my goodness i know who did it so that's cool i was with danny yeah i know i saw george running away from lights he literally headbutted me as he was leaving i was just running to go do tasks oh you're running i do taste say george okay you're always rushing to vote me out so quick no i actually saw george do this kill no no what do you mean he okay what do you mean you saw me i was nowhere near the the body was on lots that's fine i already voted george you don't have to tell me twice no yeah we're voting with george it's laser it's laser bye oh that's payback george hey wait wait look who skipped who skipped who was the one that skipped that means they're imposter i'm sorry mr beast i'm sorry the one time he got it i messed it up him i'm so sorry could you have done any worse george oh he's gonna go into the toilets right i think so yeah dude i found this last round i'm not even kidding is someone gonna stack kill now that'd be bad oh i gotta kill jack get away oh well i got the engine on anyway oh my dead body i feel bad for george the only reason i knew it was him was a headbutter i i'm not going to get mr beast voted out because i know he's had a tough time well as it was so i was with dream sapping carl so neither of us could have done the kill i'm with laser right now yeah well it wasn't based uh no i think danny is full of honk right now whoa wait why danny did leave yeah where's the body oh it wasn't the body i just went to the button who was the one who skipped last round though uh maybe george i think i saw yellow but i cannot confirm that's enough for me no no no no no no no no no i can't confirm i don't know that's enough for me danny he kind of confirmed him bloody's on your shoulders dude yeah i know he's thought out accusations and trying to find what sticks no i didn't that was an accusation it's danny i was i was in the stalls he still got the blood on him was it him oh snap oh no oh dream step back to the spot is it beast is it jimmy i i think it's mr beast but i am just gonna vouch for him i'm gonna be a mr bass simp oh my god come on you can't do this you can't stack like this what is this like what am i supposed to do i'm just waiting to see a kill happen like from the sky right here i'm gonna be just perched up on this rock i don't know you could climb rocks dude what's up chandler hey big dog hey what's up buddy they're all stacking somewhere it's pretty dweeby so i'm assuming everyone's stacking somewhere no no why are you looking for a kill i think it'd just make it really hard for anyone who actually is imposter though so it made me think that jimmy what did i do last game i did like 30 tasks and that's what i was doing at the start of this game base couldn't have done the last one did we get one of the bad guys out yet we did and by the way i was the one of the first ones to throw them under the bus and i got george out so it's either the kill cooldown is so quick at the start of the game though and it could have been someone before they went to your hiding spot well here's the thing we know there's only one left we have 10 seconds and it ha and we're voting carl all right you know you know that really does make sense to me we skip here we skip here what is this game what do i do i'm skipping see listen did you hear that did you hear that carl i could have killed you there carl you think i'm freaking imposter is it jimmy i don't know if that was the right move or not i could have thrown carl under the bus i didn't i want to go find this hidden spot is it laser beam i feel like it might be carl's really sucks at me so i have to kill carl oh my god that's it i can't do anything while they're stacked like this beast kill one of them what's happening kill one of them don't just don't kill me kill them kill him all right yeah but laser is one of the few people that trust me no don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me no i can't kill him he's my only alibi right now like i'll hard clear you dude i've got you i'm with you later i'm with you don't worry buddy you could murder in front of me and i would say it wasn't you hey get away ladies oh it's over i must protect him okay it's jimmy how do you unmute so fast no i just watched carl kill him nah it's call it's actually call no i guarantee guys i guarantee i was with beast all game dude nah it's call yeah come on coral wait jimmy don't say it where is he right now then where is he right now he's in electrical okay maybe you saw him i swear to god this is why carl the entire last round was trying to build something get kyle out of here hey if you guys want to give jimmy a compelling video where he absolutely outplays everybody then vote for me nah mate get out of here call you always do this girl chandler chandler chandler chandler please please vote jimmy here wait we're not just gonna let whoever talks the loudest nah listen listen i was with bass please vote jimmy here if it isn't jimmy it is me i literally have laser here vouching for me i was with bass the whole time if it isn't jimmy it is me if it isn't carl it's me i literally have laser here vouching for me who here is vouching for carl no one i was i was with i was with him the whole time all right it's carl i told you oh my god uh beast i was trying so hard dude i was trying so hard wow george threw it for him basically i hope you enjoyed this game of dream carl and sapnap staying together thank you everybody so much for watching if you haven't already hit that subscribe button i'm trying to be dreamed of 20 million subscribers that is all that matters go subscribe i'll see you in the next video", "n1DLqPQ_JAc": "so i was talking to mayro a couple weeks ago and next thing i knew she offered to make the entirety of super mario 3d world backwards so of course i said yes and since mera is so awesome make sure to check out her channel and subscribe so completely out of the blue i'll be attempting this challenge and completing as many levels as i can backwards the only changes made to the game are that we spawn at the end flagpoles are at the beginning and all the warp pipes pipe cannons and more boxes are reversed i'm allowed to use any power-ups i want and any strategies with them are fair game we're not counting any sort of mini bosses either only the main levels so with all that said let's get started right away you'll probably notice i'm playing the wii u version i know i know how dare i here's the thing modding is a lot easier on the wii u so that's why we went with this version i don't think the additional speed boost is gonna help much with levels anyway and speaking of once we get to the checkpoint i am hopelessly done for the other half of the level is too high up and way too far away i tried this with a few different characters but didn't have any luck the closest i got to the other side was with a cat momentum jump but the issue is the death zone kills me and even if i did make it to the other side i wouldn't have enough stamina to climb all the way up koopa troopa cave was really simple and something that's nice about mount beanpole is i'll be able to get cat suits here for free if i need any backup then i can just play this level over now plessy's punching falls was simply hilarious keep in mind that i did not request the camera to change besides removing the auto scroll and auto scrollers so i had to drive plus c while not being able to see where i was going this made controlling plessy super janky but it doesn't last long since this level can't be done you normally take this big ass jump at the end and plus he has no way of getting up there i thought switch scramble circus would be a breeze until i realized that a pipe shoots us to the end and there's no way to get across even the captain toad level spawn us at the end just to see how it changes the gameplay and for captain toad goes forth it's significantly easier since we don't have to do as much climbing bowser's highway showdown's cutscene is fantastic because instead of entering the castle peach decides to leave i mean i don't blame her to be honest the only notable thing to bring up is you do the bowser fight really early on but the level itself is easy and that's it for world one so we'll move on to world two and see where that takes us the beginning of conkedor canyon seemed tricky the camera just doesn't move at all so i had to figure out how to get up at this awkward angle after some attempts i discovered i could just use the cat suit to climb up this wall and when the platforms moved i could just jump off of that and then run back to make things more interesting for puff pride peaks i decided to not use the touchscreen the first jump was pretty far away so i needed to pull off the cat momentum jump to get to the other side what made this level so scary is that i can't see where to go the camera does not move for me one bit one of the scariest jumps is going to this platform near the cloud level i had to jump really far and climb across the wall before i started falling once i got to the checkpoint the scary jumps were gone and i was good to go when it comes to shadow play alley double cherry pass and bowser's bullet bill brigade they were super easy it's worth mentioning that the piranha plants loaded in after i passed them which i thought was pretty humorous for the underground part of really rolling hills i didn't think i'd be able to climb up this hill since it's really steep but in mario 3d world the physics are super weird and you can just jump up most hills i don't know why this works but that wraps up world 2. for world 3 there isn't anything to say about snowball park chain link charge shifty boom mansion freddie plaza panic pipeline lagoon captain toad makes a splash and the bullet bill express they're all beatable i didn't think i'd be able to do mount mustache because of all the slants but again to my surprise you can simply jump up and just hold forward so i guess this applies to all the hills in the game i did have to be careful to not get hit by the bitty buds but 3 6 was much smoother than i expected almost the entirety of world 3 was possible backwards almost for switchboard falls there's a couple of switchboards on the bottom but the other ones are way too high up for us to even get close i tried using cat momentum with luigi but had no luck i then tried it with peach and while i got farther it didn't matter i also tried climbing the waterfall only to find out that you can't climb that so this level definitely isn't happening but now on to world 4. to start things off spike's lost city was possible with a cat suit and lava rock lair was painless ant trooper hill required some damage boosting at the beginning in a well-timed cat momentum jump but otherwise there's not much to mention piranha creeper creek's piranhas weren't the easiest to avoid but if you're careful then you can get around them beatblock skyway was by far the most fun i've had with the backwards level right at the beginning is this massive slope that we have to climb up but of course the platform switched to the music so we have to time our jumps well but also make sure we switch sides accordingly [Music] now that's what i call gaming 43 available in stores now but now let's talk about big bounce by way this is what you're really watching for we've arrived at the first of our many kaizo 3d world challenges immediately we come out of the warp box and almost fall to our death only surviving by the tippy toes on the cloud the mushroom platform is nowhere near us and all we have nearby are bitty buds flying around as you just saw we can bounce off them to the halfway point but that was just the beginning i know there's more bitty buds to the left but they're much farther away so i tried jumping off the top of these brown bricks for more height only to miss my jump by a good few feet but i also didn't go very fast so i kept on trying and that's when i realized how time-consuming attempts were gonna be when i died i lost the tanooki suits so i had no choice but to go to another level to find another two suits and then go back to 4-4 it took me about two minutes to get to newki's suits and that extra time quickly added up maybe there was a faster method that i'm not aware of but this is what i did whenever i needed the suit i should also mention how bad the depth perception could be with mario 3d world there were tons of wasted attempts all because i couldn't tell exactly where luigi was on the screen it eventually got to a point where i had played this level so much that i developed muscle memory for where i was supposed to be with luigi jumping off the brown bricks got me much farther than with peach but the issue was that i wasn't able to build up enough speed which i mean duh i'm trying to build speed on two tiny blocks you're not meant to ever do that but i started to get more comfortable with building speed and then the issue arose of me spinning by accident so it came down to me running on the very edge of the bricks to build up the fastest speed if i could just do that i could probably get to that next spinny butt but it was so god damn precise i gave up on that idea and decided to just go full blast on the actual platform and that allowed me to get a tiny bit farther but never high enough to bounce off the bitty bud looking back on this level cat momentum might have also worked for this but that would have been just as difficult to pull off if not harder i tried this a few more times and no matter how good my jump was i was always too low to bounce off the bitty bud i went back to my brick strategy managed to actually build speed for a full run but accidentally jumped too early for that momentum to carry over that death was pretty tragic so i had no choice but to pull out the wii u pro controller and use a second character for help my strategy was basically the same jump as far as i can with a tanooki suit but then switch characters at the last second and reach the end that way the only issue is my runway was more limited since i was holding peach but on my first try i actually overshot my throw so i knew that this could be done so i jumped for it once again let go of peach hit the first bitty bite yes but i lost too much speed so i fell right to the bottom but then this happened [Music] oh yeah now that's what i'm talking about i'm pleased to say that the level was actually possible despite all odds so let's move on to world five so captain toad plays peek-a-boo backstreet bustle bob homes below cakewalk flip searchlight sneak coin express and king kathunk's castle were all super easy sunshine seaside is partially a plessy level but since we're going backwards we start with that part and then get stuck from a high wall there was one somewhat hard jump at the beginning of tricky trapeze theater but of course i can't make progress due to the lack of the zipline and for sprawling savannah i'm blocked from using the pipe cannon not much interesting to point out world 5 so under world 6 next clear pipe crews spooky seaweed wreck hands on hall bullet bill base and bowser's bobbum brigade was more than possible at thai food flurries i thought i was going to be stuck for a long time with this line of typhoo but i switched to toad and just built up a lot of speed as soon as i could go i ran up the hill and by the very hair managed to avoid all the gust moving to deep jungle drift and finally for fuzzy time mine we cannot match the fuzzies things start to get really interesting now that we're moving into world castle fort firebros simmering lava lake and captain toad gets thwamped where a piece of cake with switchblack ruins i can't reach all the question mark spaces to open the wall and there's an invisible way up at the top then with trick trap tower i'm stuck due to a lack of a zip line once again and with rammer head reef a gust of water wouldn't let me pass i tried using a lucky bell and that actually got me to the bottom but i wasn't able to swim through the gust fast enough but things are about to get spicy red hot run is already a pretty hard level but it might not seem that bad to play backwards but that's where you'd be wrong because again the camera is facing the wrong way so that means i have to somehow make my way across these platforms without seeing where i'm going half the time with tons of speed boost without falling and going fast enough since there's only 100 seconds on the clock this was so painfully unfun i don't even know where to begin the first 15 minutes was just learning the route and trying to build muscle memory because that was going to be my only option with this godforsaken camera i learned that the best way to slow down the speed boost was the ground pound a few times in place this worked really well but the problem is that i don't have very much time i eventually made it to the end only to remember that a pipe cannon shoots us to this area which means this is probably impossible i decided to jump anyway and as i started to fall the pipe cannon popped up and i just groaned this might be possible with a tanooki suit which means i have to keep playing this level and look it's not that i don't mind the challenge in fact that's what makes these videos so fun to make and watch what i don't like is making blind jumps and not being able to see where i'm going after several tries i got to the end with a tanooki suit and completely flubbed the jump that was really annoying but i kept going to find that i made it much farther that time which is a good sign i played this level so many times that even without seeing half the time i had figured out exactly where to go consistently so i wouldn't die and get hit and would also still have enough time left at the end another attempt at this jump it was much higher than last time but i still wasn't quite high enough to reach the pipe so i thought luigi would do the trick and unfortunately he covered about the same distance as peach did so of course i brought in a second character so i could try throwing peach into the pipe only to realize how obnoxious this was gonna be peach needed to be in a bubble or the camera would focus on her for whatever reason after several more attempts i went for a jump which was a bit early then let go of peach and even still i couldn't reach the pipe i know i wasn't perfectly accurate on that attempt but the fact that i wasn't high enough after that still boggles my mind so i just said screw it i gave pizza tanooki tail and tried again it was a great jump this time so i threw peach and for some reason she didn't gain height what did i throw her too late does this not work when peach has the tanooki suit i have no idea i thought it might have just been a fluke so i tried to jump again and peach didn't get a height boost just like last time i tried throwing her away earlier and still i had no success what the hell is happening i feel like this is rigged somehow another attempt in with an insanely good jump but it just wasn't good enough to reach the pipe i tried one more time without using the speed boost thinking that maybe that was the problem but once again peach didn't get any height from my throw so i just gave up after that if it's possible then you let me know i didn't try a cat momentum because i knew there wouldn't be enough distance or height to get across boiling blue belly belts first jump requires a super precise cat momentum and i'm kind of surprised i caught it on the first try after that is a lot of really careful jumps since the ground keeps coming in and out of the lava none of these jumps aren't feasible but i had to be so careful to not make any mistakes or would make everything way harder without the catsuit but folks we aren't done with world castle yet we have one more level to talk about and this one is one hell of a doozy bowser's lava late keep may not seem so bad at first you fight bowser at the beginning and just move on after that proceeding through the warp box is where the real fun begins if you don't have a cat suit you aren't standing a chance against this jump it's definitely doable but the suit is 100 required on my next try i made the jump and while it was scary i had plenty of time to pull myself up and survive i did get hit by the spikes but it seemed like it wouldn't matter that much these jumps across lava balls are absolutely terrifying but you can avoid getting hit at least but that's not where the problem is near the end you usually have to make a bridge fall down with a switch of course since i'm playing backwards the bridge is still standing up tall and i have no way of getting around the bridge so what that means is i have to get through this level with a cat suit and somehow climb my way around the bridge and survive i have to fight bowser without getting hit in order to use my cat suit so that way if i do get hit after that jump i'll have a backup suit for the ending and hey maybe this doesn't sound that hard but the nerves get to you when this whole process takes so long and no i couldn't use my gamepad to make this fight easier i didn't have access to the gamepad eventually i got through the fight without getting hit and barely avoided the hammer bros hammer so i could move on i just about had a stroke avoiding this lava ball by the way that was way too close and guess what nerves got to me and i got hit anyway slowly but surely though i made my way to the end only realizing i can't even get a good running start with this jump and i have one go at it and i must remind you i cannot turn the camera and see where i'm supposed to aim but i ran in a circle waited for the spikes to move made my jump slowly started to turn towards the stage and just like that i was able to barely get across and climb my way around i cannot believe this was possible that took a lot of composure to keep myself together but it is done and we can move on to world bowser after that big triumph world bowser is much less dramatic as spiky spike bridge cookie cog works footlight lane and the bowser train express is possible unfortunately there's a long stream of levels that couldn't be completed including plus he's doomed downhill due to there being no ground for plessy to leap to deepwater dungeon had plessy blocked by a wall and a beam in the dark can't be done since we can't reach the doorway up top rump lump inferno's grown blunt blocks aren't in our sight and last but not least is the final boss the great tower of bowser land this can't be done because there's no zipline but it's definitely worth checking out normally you fight off a bunch of meowsers at the end but now you just get a bunch of clones that are all going the wrong way we all knew bowser wasn't the brightest but meowser takes it a step further but now we've moved on to world star and rainbow run starts with a really hard jump at the beginning until i realized i was over complicating it by a lot and believe it or not the plessy section can technically be completed the only problem is i can't hit the checkpoint or go into the warp box and i also have no way of getting off plessy so this level's done for with that said however super galaxy super black land and captain toad takes a spin or a breeze rolling ride run could also be done and it was actually really fun i needed to do a pretty tight cat momentum jump to clear this gap while not getting hit by conch door then the rest of the stage was basically staying as high up as i could to avoid tricky gaps it was an exhilarating one to complete with pipa's fog bog the river of poison extends way too far out for us to reach the next platform and then cosmic cannon cluster has no lifter platforms or any semblance of a chance the great gold poll was really interesting because i was spawned at the very end where the gold pole can reach to so that meant i needed to find a way to get back to the beginning as quickly as possible as you'd probably guessed the fastest method i could muster was using cat momentum with toad i was able to get pretty far but not quite far enough to reach the flagpole so thanks to some help and suggestions from the mario 3d world speedrunning discord they said i should try it with luigi since his jumps are higher and better and while he didn't move much faster than toad and i wasn't crouch jumping he was able to clear bigger gaps this was the best i could muster [Music] one second holy that was a close call but hot damn we aren't done yet as honeycomb starway is another story since we removed the auto scrolling that means i can attempt the level as if it were normal but the camera is still top down and worse this blue stuff is blue lava so that's not fun to touch the platforms usually come in as you get close to them but since i'm on the opposite side i don't really get that luxury i tried jumping to see if i could spawn one in and not only did i find a platform but i discovered the bees the bees in which i can jump off of for extra height so with my catsuit i did a cat momentum jump and lo and behold i found even more bees and another platform that i could potentially land on with much better cat momentum this time i managed to bounce off a bee and actually land on that platform that's freaking cool and all but i'm kind of stuck again and the fire piranhas are spamming a ton of fire as well i had no idea what to do so i did another jump and of course i found another platform but this one is way farther away and seemed much more unreachable i tried jumping on the plan and was glad to be able to reach it which gave me a few more ideas with peach i tried to jump again and while i was able to get much farther i didn't get the height that i needed to climb up several more tries later i bounced off both of these plants to see if that would help me get height and while it did i lost too much speed and look i know it was going the wrong way but it wouldn't have made much of a difference and that's when i decided i was going to use the cat and tanooki suit in tandem i'd use the cat suit to get to the first platform and then a tanuki for the other one and while admittedly i didn't go super fast on this try i was still falling way too quickly to reach the platform so i tried the same strategy with luigi and guess what i floated into the starry sky of doom big big surprise but silly me i was trying to bounce on the wrong side and this time i was getting a lot closer to that platform and let's play that death back i purposefully went for that b because i realized i could use it for an additional jump so i switched back to peach and the attempts were on unfortunately i didn't have a bee near me so i wasn't able to give my idea a fair try next time however there were a few bees which gave me a glimmer of hope but i was going in the wrong direction and i ended up missing my target on one of the bounces anyway and then this came [Music] next oh my god i am astounded that actually worked that alone was an accomplishment pulling off and i hate to say it but there are no other platforms for me to go to next and there's no enemies close by to jump off that's really too bad considering all the effort i just put in but there's one more crazy level to talk about in world star and that is gargantuan grotto this is another level with a water gust that requires a lucky bell i figured i'd get stuck again just like last time but i was actually able to swim just fast enough to beat out the current and keep going at the checkpoint i ran into what seemed to be a dead end there were a bunch of great blocks above me with no way to get through except i noticed a tiny hole that luigi would be able to fit through reaching this hole was a problem because the wall was so short that i couldn't grab it i figured a cat momentum jump could get me there easily but it's just short of grabable so when i jumped to this wall i delayed my cat dive so i could cover more distance and that managed to do the trick i thought it was all good and dandy up until i found another hole in an even worse spot i simply could not jump off the wall and up the hole was just too far away for that to work it was quickly sinking in that i was gonna have to do this again with more characters so that's what i did in just my luck this jump wasn't high enough even when i jumped with rosalina it still didn't work but i'm not giving up yet because i am way too stubborn i do the level again with three characters and a little help from chary5 i simply cannot bounce all three characters at once by myself so we helped control one of them within 10 seconds we line up everything and actually make our way up to the top shari 5 coming in clutch thank you so much and you should go check out his channel by the way i have it linked down below that was a bit intense but world mushroom was a bit of a breather nightfall is on really rolling hills spiky mountain beanpole trouble in play alley and gigantic sea sick wreck are all possible with no problems deep black jungle drift is another big nope in fact the hands on hall stairs don't open up so you can't get through now i am stoked to talk about broken blue bully belt because i cannot believe the things i managed to do what makes this one so hard is the limited amount of rising and falling platforms not only do they rise and fall but they're not safe to stand on for more than two to three seconds so i had the crazy idea of landing midway through the cycle with cat momentum and on my first attempt i actually caught really close since i can't move the camera i'm literally making blind jumps and praying i land in the right spot eventually i got a really good jump in and actually landed stunned by that happening i make my way back and things are looking grim as i don't get enough distance to safety what i basically have to do is a perfect blind jump but also time the cycle so i have more time to build speed and this is made harder without being able to move the camera but then i decide to try it with a tanooki [Music] i'm sorry i have to say it but we're sounding the alarms because we have a god gamer alert here now i just have to get to the checkpoint which i do and i never have to do that part ever ever again we're not quite out of this mess yet as the rest of these jumps are also super precise and the cycle goes against us thankfully messing up is no longer a big deal because since we've got the checkpoint we can just grab another tanuki suit and keep trying as long as i timed the cycle properly the jumps were manageable eventually i got myself across this section and after that it wasn't too bad and with all that done mushroom 7 is finished and that is a freaking miracle but now on to our last big world which is world flower with piranha creeper creek after dark faster fort fire bros sprawling savannah rabbit run shifty boom mansion pipeline boom lagoon blast block skyway towering sunshine seaside spiky spike bridge steak and boss blitz all being very easy switch shock circus doesn't have a zip line and floating fuzzy time mine has a problem with the fuzzies again honeycomb skyway brings us back to a level that i am not happy to see again but alas i try the same strategies as before and i even have clear pipes to use as additional help so i avoid the hell out of this fireball then bounce off this fire plant and i'm about to miss the platform until another comes in and saves me at the last second after that i do a big jump and i'm baffled to find a clear pipe so close that i could land on it after that is another clear pipe and shockingly i don't have any more hard jumps the rest of this stage is already fully built so i just walk up to the flag and actually beat this that is amazing to wrap things up captain toad's fiery finale is easy of course but let's get into champions road now this one isn't possible because pipe cannons take you to each individual section but i know everyone is curious if you could beat this backwards samira went ahead and added warp boxes just so we can test that the hardest part is still this speed boost section simply because we can't see where to go the lasers come into frame so quickly that it's hard to react to without getting hit the water segment isn't all that more difficult the timing is a little tighter but you can still get through it and honestly that's all that's worth mentioning you can get to the end with the warp boxes but it's not as hard as you would imagine it being out of all the levels 27 out of 95 were possible so around 28 couldn't be done i was a little unsure if these levels would make for an interesting backwards video but it turns out quite a few of them required precise movement and tricks so that leaves me quite satisfied and i hope you are too and thanks a bunch for watching i'll speak with you all very soon and until

to construct more homes faster and in a more efficient way countless innovators have found themselves drawn by the idea of being able to quickly print a structure and have spent years trying to scale the technology but for all their efforts that 3d printed world has proven elusive and many impressive prototypes have struggled to become viable for mass production but things have just taken a massive step forward in germany with the completion of the first ever 3d printed home to become fully certified under a national government's building regulations [Music] the impact of this moment for construction and for the buildings we all use could be huge with the promise of cutting waste reducing time on site and addressing labor shortages some see 3d printing as the answer to many of our world's challenges originally used for small-scale prototypes advances in 3d printing have led to the creation of full-scale structures like bridges and homes and even plans for mankind's first martian base but while 3d printed structures have appeared around the world from canada and the netherlands to dubai which wants to 3d print a quarter of its new buildings by 2030 the technology is yet to take off as a widespread building technique but the completion of this 3d printed house in beckham germany is set to change everything developed by leading formwork and scaffolding firm perry experts in its disruptive products and technologies departments and its project partners the structure a detached single family property is the first 3d printed house in germany and offers 160 square meters of living space across its two stories critically the structure is the first 3d printed building in germany to become certified with a national building accreditation smashing a major barrier and paving the way for larger more complex projects located just outside the city of um perry's team is now working on the largest 3d printed multi-family house in europe with 380 square meters of living space divided into five apartments across three levels so how did perry get into the world of 3d printing here at perry we have let's let's call it a think tank it's a department called disruptive products and technologies and they think about projects or products and technologies that might substitute our current core products that might endanger our business model in this department so various ideas are always thrown around and actually actively pursued so it's not just a monitoring department and one of the topics even years ago was 3d construction printing when we build up the printer on a construction site directly on the site and we start sprinting there that was a moment for me which i where i realized that we are printing that on site and people will live in there so that was for me a moment where i really said wow that's not just um theory and that's not just in a lab it's it could it could happen in in real the homes were both built with cobord's modular bod2 printing system a flexible platform that can be scaled to suit projects of varying size the printer needs just two operators and takes less than 48 hours to set up on site once up and running the system can print as fast as a meter per second using data from integrated design models there's obviously there's been a lot of firms around the world that have done this a lot of research teams of 3d printed buildings over the years and there's been kind of different levels of excitement around it why isn't it widespread why isn't this just the way that we build all of our buildings 3d printing really affects the overall construction process it has impact on the planning side execution of the walls but also on other trades and and the planning and permitting all of these things come into play here the buildings that we've seen across the globe actually have seen a steady increase in let's say validity so the first ones have been basically kind of big 3d printed flower pots where all the other trades have been thrown in there but nobody's really thought about how to integrate it into a full construction process maybe sometimes in the news and media that hasn't been it's always been portrayed like everything was perfect but obviously this has been a steady learning curve and now we feel that we've hit another milestone where we've now been able to execute these permitted buildings what perry have done in germany with this building how is that different to what we've seen before in dubai the netherlands you know many kinds of other places we wanted to do real world architectural scale permitted residential buildings um so we've done lots and lots of tests to to get this german building permit and we have one of the toughest building codes around so that's that's quite a milestone to get these completely normally permitted residential homes and that's i think where the very core difference lies i have included project partners from the start we are working directly with a construction company we're working directly with architects which don't want just to make a demo project the real project where later people will live in it's a project where the investor sketch rents out every month so it's something which will be used and the other thing is i guess the the speed and the size now it's the the actually the biggest 3d printed building in europe perry also engaged a number of the core trades on these projects a critical hurdle that few other 3d printed buildings have attempted to cross with services and other works already coordinated with the structural design errors on site have been almost completely eradicated saving time money and waste material while the savings may be modest here they'd soon add up across an entire estate or housing development what kind of real world savings have you seen on this project so far this really this integration of of other trades has a huge impact um so we've had the electrician come into one of these buildings and he walks around and says well guys you know i'll be saving up to like 12 days in here um so we are saving a lot of labor in other trades because there's in the buildings we're executing there's not going to be a single slot that has to be cut nobody's going to have to drill a hole for a power outlet though the design of these buildings may feel relatively straightforward when compared to some of today's architecture the team are using the lessons learned to construct larger structures in a variety of forms with german building certifications now under their belt the team are planning more projects using different materials and with a focus on further reducing waste but while there is cause for optimism we're still some way from the widespread uptake of 3d printing and several challenges remain not least breaking into a traditionally conservative industry i mean securing german building certification is a huge step for you guys in a huge step for the world of 3d printing what kind of other challenges and barriers are there on the way between where we are now and this being the way we build our homes buildings offices well it's a lot about educating people really um to know you know it's it's a different type of of planning a building um it's different for the contractor it's different for the electrician it's it's different all around for everybody involved so all these trades now have to learn a how to cope with this technology and how to make the best of it not be threatened by it but to to see the potential it can have for these individual traits and make their life easier and make construction more safe and more efficient there's definitely a spot for all the other conventional construction techniques who are also evolving so 3d printing will play a very important role we are convinced of that um but this educational diffusion process into the market will still take some time would you live in a 3d printed house god of course right away i'd be all over the design of that um i mean just having round shapes which are also way more sustainable than the weird rectangles we that we build right now um definitely and you know we've tested all of it so we know that it's very very stable while the technology has had its challenges the success of perry's project in germany marks a major step forward and will stand as a powerful case study for innovators rekindling the determination to make this building technique viable at scale that 3d printed world we've imagined has just moved one huge step closer to becoming

it plays like save the girl so instead of saving the girl we're gonna prank the teacher which is miss t so hopefully this game is fun and hopefully you guys enjoy it so without further ado let's begin tip to start oh miss that's missy's car it looks weird wow he didn't even see that there's smoke it's not it's not it's not it's not misty's fault it's your fault that you can't see the smoke now your face is all black what do you do mess up the car i don't know but i guess break okay what is he doing oh he's messing with it oh oh oh what came off from the car make sure t doesn't leave uh i don't know a door controller what is this oh oh what this misty misty's head is so big [Music] okay oh okay i failed okay here we are again look see he doesn't he doesn't even under the smoke it's on his teeth it's your fault your face is completely black okay now you're gonna mess with her car okay let's let's see uh uh i don't know i guess maybe shane i don't have this chain oh what is this oh what is he doing what are you doing with the chain oh make sure misty doesn't leave do i have to use paint the door control didn't work just now oh oh [Music] okay oh she's thinking that the the garage door is open but it's just paint wow he's such a good artist mrs is so big okay what i failed what did we do wrong do i have to choose break okay maybe i have to choose break and then choose paint okay let's try it again okay here we are again uh mess with the car brake [Music] okay he's messing the car [Music] looks like the carpet make sure tea doesn't leave use paint okay okay okay now he's gonna leave hopefully this works [Music] oh my god okay missy i think she's dead or maybe not well that was fun let's head to the next level [Music] oh what's this oh is that a parrot oh what's she doing oh she's feeding the parrot [Music] yes i'm truly the best but okay [Music] oh mess with the parrot hmm message the parrot okay dried fruit or magic book which one should i pick magic book or dried fruit i think the magic book looks interesting let's try it okay oh the magic book is right there what is he doing wait what are you doing why bad words why wait why is he teaching the parents bad words hey boy what did your parents tell about saying bad words in front of an innocent parent help parrot escape i think i'm gonna fail okay oh oh miss tea is stuff now okay [Music] huh [Music] i guess teaching the parent bad words works but you don't have to say bad words all the times so i guess it works well anyways let's move on to the next level oh she's playing she's playing the piano that's actually quite good actually okay okay no one can play the piano like i do not even beethoven oh message the piano the stool or the metronome against this [Music] okay stop t from playing hmm let's try the piano okay what are we doing what are we doing oh we're sabotaging it okay are you gonna play it wait a second wait what oh oh never mind yay i win again let's move on to the next level and also misty no longer play the piano anymore yay oh what is this oh she's stupid kid oh what are we doing what are you doing mess with the tv equipment remote we broke the remote make sure missy has a bad time soda bottle what are gonna do with it what are we doing with it okay [Music] oh wait did we win again that was easy okay let's move on to the next level again okay oh her car is pink now okay why are there no windshields okay oh what's wrong hello hello hello hello hello good luck getting to school kid oh my gosh oh now what's he's gonna do with the car mess with the equipment i guess banner this one wait what is he doing what is he doing what are you doing with it mess up the car entire grace hmm maybe tire wait maybe oh oh he's messing with the tire okay now what now what is he doing now you know you can just go from the garage door or whatever okay oh she gonna find out huh how did it get so dirty what is she doing oh okay let's go to the next level again this is for the trashy neighborhood oh what let's scare the teacher what what okay what should we use to scare the teacher dumpster newspaper hmm what if i tried newspaper oh our what are we doing are we cutting it scare the heck out of her hmm i don't know raccoon leaf blower i think the raccoon there's a raccoon there oh okay [Music] oh no no i failed poor raccoon no okay this is the second time i failed wait no the third time i failed okay let's just try it more hmm what if i try dumpster okay [Music] let's get the heck out of her leaf blower let's try a leaf blower because she's not afraid of the raccoon okay oh oh oh oh oh what wait wait a second way to go what i failed let's try it again maybe we tried dumpster and the raccoon okay let's try raccoon the raccoon is sleeping okay you're putting the raccoon in a dumpster okay okay she's drying out the trash again will this work oh did we see die if this team died did the raccoon killed her uh okay i think misty is dead rest in peace okay let's move on to the next level okay oh now what are we doing what kind i don't know add something in water can we killer okay let's let's see it's weed killer yay okay now what are you going to do little it's sign water me or no sun since we use the wheat killer on that watering can let's try this water me do not water water me wait oh she found out [Music] oh what's she doing oh she's gonna water it up [Music] okay that didn't work it just killed the wheat not the flour okay here we are again oh no those aren't a wheat big enough to stink the entire neighborhood add something in what i can salt i think salt we're using salt i don't think saltwater effect will affect it maybe it will okay let let's use this again water me [Music] okay she's gonna water it she's gonna water it hopefully the the flower dies hopefully hopefully it dies wait [Music] she's sad oh no okay i killed her flower okay let's move on to the next level again okay oh she's in her bathroom okay uh what are we doing put something in toilet soap bar drop something in tank phone booster or drain opener maybe drain opener let's try that okay oh what's gonna happen is it is it gonna work [Music] what what oh no i failed okay let's try what a beauty okay we're here now uh maybe we should use gloves not the soapboard gloves okay read some gloves oh we just threw it in just something in tank what's this foam booster let's try that okay okay hopefully this works please okay okay did misty just go through that wall well guys what do you think of the game it looks fun right right oh and thank you

may look like toothpaste but this 3d printing technology is spitting out a 1900 square foot house the concrete foundation interior and exterior walls and utility conduits this is the final product we're trying to build houses in half the time for half the price new york based sq4d printed the model home in about two days with barely three workers and it's cheap our profits will be higher and we will be able to show that with more projects that we do how do you sell a 3d printed house i'd like to think it sells itself what is the weirdest thing anybody has ever said to you when they walk into this place oh man is it plastic the company now has the permits to build on this site down the road the first 3d printed home for sale to the public 1500 square feet three bedrooms two baths listed at just under 300 thousand dollars that's about half the price of a comparable new home in the area the offers are in the thousands we are getting people people are seeing the price across the nation and loving that potential buyers like the johnsons from kansas city are already lining up we've been looking since september of last year a lot of the homes in the two counties is just impossible to find anything at this price and this quality so this is the result the raw result of 3d printing it's kind of like concrete corduroy but if you don't love this look they can smooth it out for you and make it look just like a regular wall but for the home builders this is a real game changer right now they're up against a severe labor shortage as well as skyrocketing prices for lumber and both of those are combining to just make their costs really really difficult right now so this could address both of those back to you guys yeah diana that's amazing and the argument now largely seems to be price for 3d printing and what it can do in real estate but 3d printing technology should allow companies to create shapes perhaps do things with engineering that are impossible under traditional methods do you think that there's a premium end of this 3d printing and construction market absolutely in fact we were talking to the builder about what the outside of the house could look like and he was saying that you could put literally any image into the 3d printer and customize the outside of the home so it would look like shingles or it would look like a different type of wood you could even put your face on the front of the home if you wanted to so the possibilities are really endless with the technology it's just going to be a question of what the buyers want and if the builders really really buy into it not my face no no thank you but but point taken diana oleg i think shepard smith here thanks for watching cnbc on youtube", "q0R6uU1Lvu4": "and we have ignition there we go all right and we're going to drip we're going to drip oh we're getting drips all right guys today we're talking about fiber x nylon plus gf30 from 3dx tech this stuff right here this is a 30 glass fiber reinforced nylon six copolymer or pa6 which is polyamide six and it's an industrial grade beast 3dx tech formulated this specifically to be very stiff and strong without being brittle now polyamides or nylons pa are the workhorse of the plastics industry because of their excellent mechanical chemical and thermal resistance now this is the same type of pa6 used in the automotive industry for under the hood applications because it resists fuel lubricants heat and mechanical loading up to 170 celsius fiber xp a6g f30 is suitable for use on practically any open source 3d printer with a heated bed that's right you don't need a chamber although it can help so here's the box and the spool inside when you buy it off our store looks just like this you'll notice it's very very thick vacuum sealed bag now if this comes to you and it's not vacuum sealed don't worry you're gonna have to dry this out of the box anyway as with all the nylons and most materials in general it does absorb some moisture uh just like nylon six so you will have to do that just keep that in mind so let's talk a little bit about where you're gonna see this stuff used in industries really it's ideal for structural engineering grade applications it's exceptionally stiff and strong without being brittle like a lot of the carbon fiber blends you'll see it's got excellent chemical resistance it's very suitable for numerous automotive and industrial applications in chemicals and solvents it's got super high thermal properties up to 170 celsius for in-use applications depending on of course the mechanical loads that are applied to it and it's got improved dimensional stability over nylon because the glass fibers reduce the shrinkage the lifting the curling the warp and it has very very very strong layer bonding by the way if this information is helpful to you please hit that like button it tells the algorithm on youtube that our content is valuable and you want some more of it and you might as well subscribe while you're down there because we've got a ton of these videos and comparison videos still coming out on the way and content every week so what kind of machine do you need to actually print this first of all your nozzle temperature needs to reach at least 260 celsius up to about 280 celsius and you can kind of go a little bit higher than that as well as for the bed temperature 60 to 75 c works for most applications and with adhesive with our nanopolymer adhesive it actually works fantastic with this blend of nylon now as far as a chamber goes a heated chamber it's not required but it always makes nylon print a little bit better now let's talk about some basic material specs so like regular nylon or carbon fiber pa6 it's got a glass transition temperature of around 70 celsius but the hdt heat deflection temperature is much higher thanks to the 30 percent of fibers all the way up to 186 celsius now let's get into some basic strength specifications for tensile strength you're getting around 63 megapascals and a tensile modulus of about 4 261 but do keep in mind the way you print your part and the way it's designed the orientation which is printed is going to have a dramatic effect on strength because of that z-layer adhesion that's one of the things in fdm with almost every single material so definitely print it in the best orientation and design your part for fdm first now if you want all the other data all the data sheets are online on our website at visionminder.com data so you can find all the potential modulus the elongation impact strength and all that juicy good stuff on there next let's talk about some electrical properties now because this uses glass fiber instead of carbon fiber it still carries the insulative properties of nylon for electrical applications this particular blend has a surface resistance of 10 to the ninth ohms squared on the astm d257 testing standard now let's just get into it real quick and test out some example parts let's check them out then we're going to break them we're going to burn them we're going to do all that good stuff the first thing you'll notice about pa6 with 30 glass is the surface finish is much rougher than most other materials i mean you can tell there's some fibers coming out of this thing it's probably two or three times as rough as regular carbon fiber nylon so the layer lines are extremely hidden but the whole surface is very very textured now i'm just going to show you real quick the difference this is cfpei and as you can tell this is cf ultum super high temp really really cool material but as you can tell the surface finish i mean you should be able to see that texture it's significantly different now this stuff is around 10 to 13 percent carbon fill whereas this is 30 percent glass fill you really really really notice the difference now let's go ahead and take these things and burn them and break them now before i do that safety first kids um safety third i don't know whatever i'm going to bring out my handy dandy babco vice along with my safety glasses of course because this stuff might explode now it's not supposed to be as brittle as the carbon fiber stuff but we're going to test that we're going to see exactly what happens before i do we're going to do the vase test and i'm just going to take my thumbs and shove them into the vase and we're gonna watch and see how it breaks where it breaks if it even breaks see if pa6 didn't break i actually crushed the entire vase and it it didn't even break at all uh so we're just gonna start with that i'm just going to put some in here see what deflection is like all right yeah it's deforming it's definitely soft now i see some layers splitting it's a little bit different you're going to have a little bit different layer adhesion with all this fiber i guess okay put it in there and break it apart now as you can see here it's breaking across the layers but it's shifting up and down through the layers constantly let me do a full crush on this puppy all right all right interesting this stuff it feels i don't know it's weird it feels soft it's definitely not brittle they did a great job with that we're getting stringing i've never really seen that i don't know if you can see that on camera but all these little tiny strings and it's almost like fiberglass which technically it is before we get into the burning test i'm actually going to break this little sample bar just like all our other comparison videos and let's just let's check it out ready here we go okay okay so it broke and as you can see in here good layer of fusion you don't really see the layer lines and whatnot i'm gonna break this apart yeah it's definitely stuck to itself all right cool well let's get into some fire stuff now uh before i do to protect myself and others from the fumes of burning plastics i've got the bofa fume extractor this is the print pro ii comes with this awesome little flexible arm here and i love using this for soldering in the office even grinding it'll pull up some particles and i'm just going to turn this thing on we get this on our website at visionminder.com bofa along with the print pro three and four and they are enclosed systems this one actually filters and just goes out into the air uh but it's 6 000 6 700 bucks anyway really really handy device to have especially if you're going to be burning stuff in a studio rob all right i'm gonna light this on fire and we're gonna see how much it smokes after i put it out and what it drips like and we have ignition there we go all right and we're gonna drip we're gonna drip oh we're getting drips i definitely used to do this with army men in the backyard i lit my neighbor's lawn on fire one time call me a pyro will yeah yeah i love it it's high temp it's fire it's good that was cool all right interesting now instead of doing such a thin walled part let's actually light on fire this sample bar because it's a lot thicker and so we'll sort of see how the um how the letters react you know when exposed to open flame let me just get this thing on fire again let's get back to the good stuff rob right okay okay all right we got full ignition on the side there it's a little blue flame you can barely see it all right now that's picking up a little bit so hold it down like that i'm going to see how long it takes before it drips it's about to drip dude it's like boiling this is freaky looking this is not something you want to use when it's going to be exposed to direct flame i'm just going to put this out because oh yeah nice and deformed i like that and the whole thing is soft so maybe not the best material for direct flame we got a bunch of other high temperature high performance materials on our website like peak oath and pps2 that are flame retardant will not catch on fire will self-extinguish and will barely off gas at all thanks for watching this video check out our all our different materials at vision.com materials you've heard that enough times already uh and yeah thanks for watching have a positive rest your day and i'll see you on the next video you", "-Z-HdQ-NCrE": "when you think about 3d printing you're probably thinking about this my hope is to convince you that 3d printing is a much bigger idea maybe even bigger than arc invest gives it credit for 3d printing isn't any one thing it's a process it's about turning your vision into a reality one layer at a time it doesn't matter how complex or precise or strange the design there are almost no limits when it comes to materials which explores how 3d printing could transform the food industry edible growth is about 3d printing with living organisms there are almost no limits when it comes to scale don't just think about 3d printed houses think about 3d printed communities designed like printed circuit boards that's the big idea because there are almost no limits to the designs or the materials used there are almost no limits to the 3d printing process besides cost time and imagination hopefully 3d printing is starting to capture your imagination like it has mine in my opinion a good imagination is key to developing a vision of the future worth investing in and as it turns out 3d printing has captured the imagination of arc invest as well 3d printing and automation which 3d printers definitely fall under are two of only six big ideas that have never dropped from the list big ideas is a publication that archinvest releases every year to talk about the groups of technologies they think are going to change the world soon like starting now soon for 3d printing however arc invest has been saying now for years and for years they've continued to put their money behind their vision of 3d printing through their actively managed thematic etfs here's how i would map their six funds rk arcg arc w arc q arc f and arc x on to these big ideas 3d printing stocks sit inside rq arc invest's fund themed around the autonomous revolution and i expect to see them in arc x arc invest's soon to be released fund themed around space exploration 3d printing stocks also sit inside rk archinvest's flagship fund and they even maintain their own 3d printing index fund ticker symbol prnt to track the performance of the industrial 3d printing space as a whole so let's get a quick overview of this big idea from tasha keeney arc invest's analyst focused on autonomous technology and robotics strategy after that we will hear from kathy wood herself and finally i'll jump in with my ultimate vision for 3d printing a big idea that i'm surprised archinvest isn't talking about way more often let's start with tasha 3d printing is totally revolutionizing manufacturing with 3d printing complexity is free so you're allowed to create these structures that you could have never created before with traditional manufacturing so the interesting thing about 3d printing is a lot of people think the opportunity is over there was this period in 2014 2015 where everyone thought there'd be a 3d printer in all of our houses and that never happened we don't think it ever will the real opportunity for 3d printing is industrial use cases 3d printing is a form of additive manufacturing so traditional or subtractive manufacturing you can think of as you have a big block of material and you shave away at it to create your part 3d printing builds the part from the ground up in a layer by layer process and when you do that you get a lot of advantages one of the biggest ones is you basically eliminate any constraints that you previously had on your design and in doing that you can actually now use ai to design the part so you get these parts that a human could have never imagined that could have never been produced before but you can today with 3d printing so this is really disruptive for the healthcare and aerospace markets any market where you have very complex low volume parts so for aerospace you can often save weight in 3d printing and a very small percentage savings and weight so if you reduce the weight of a part by five percent you could save uh 20 percent on fuel burn so that makes a lot of difference to the the margins of these aerospace companies on the healthcare side anything that's customized basically you can scan a human body and print out an implant that's designed specifically for the patient previously implants you'd find whatever the closest fit was you might actually have to shave away at the patient's bone to make it fit so you're getting shorter operating times and better patient outcomes with this technology so because 3d printing lets us build things layer by layer it allows for amazing one part designs that could never be possible when you make something from a mold or by cutting it out of a larger block 3d printing reduces labor costs part counts risks of failure weight complexity and material waste and arc invest has been calling this out for years so uh where the heck are these things here's kathy wood explaining what's happening with 3d printing during her recent interview on etf trends with tom lydon focusing on 2021's big ideas 3d printing true valley of despair category we've been uh pounding the table on this for a long time and of course uh the dagger in it this year was or last year was the coronavirus it that hit aerospace autos but a particularly aerospace the killer app for 3d printing harder than almost any space uh and uh and yet today i think i i saw in one of the i might have been the ge report that planes are retiring at such a fast rate that the pace of air airline deliveries is now outpacing the retirement so that's that's good news and it's good news for 3d printing we do believe this market is going to scale at a 60 percent annualized rate during the next five years we have been saying this for quite some time and one thing after another has derailed it the aerospace companies have uh gross margins in the 15 to 20 range they're much lower this year of course but normalized and so they have every incentive now to accelerate uh the the use case for 3d printing on their planes and we think that's going to be one of the largest opportunities we always look for new ideas during the valley of despair and so you'll see we increased our exposure to 3d printing uh in the last year i just saw a report kathy on 3d printed houses yes china in china china's been uh fast forwarding on that one yes absolutely uh they're they're tiny uh but uh they're happening and uh they're they're very expensive they're pro prototypical right now but that gives you a sense of where this is going it's going to be ubiquitous as we bring the costs down and as the technology becomes more sophisticated whoa let's back up a second yep right there zoom enhance okay aerospace and automobiles because you're reducing parts weight and steps during production machinery makes sense because you can 3d print new types of tools molds and structural components and 3d printing for healthcare enables the production of custom fit surgical implants medical devices and personal protective equipment uh where the heck is housing no seriously where the heck are all the houses there's a massive shortage of homes for sale today since this time last year there's a record 44 percent less homes for sale in rural areas 38 percent less in suburban areas and 17 percent less in urban areas combined this is a 34 decrease in housing availability the median sale price for a house is up an average of 15 percent from just one year ago 15 in a matter of months that's a massive rally and the median time a house stays on the market was cut by about 40 percent which means the average home is selling in one month instead of about two even at these fifteen percent higher prices and just to be clear these stats account for the fact that homes have been getting bigger in general the price per square foot is also up about fifteen percent year over year this is what current headlines mean when they talk about the affordable housing crisis hopefully i've proven to you that there is a real quantifiable problem in the real estate market right now or said another way real estate is ready for disruption this ordinary looking home could lead to a revolution in real estate not in the design but how it was built you are sitting in a 3d printed 1900 square foot structure kirk anderson of construction tech company sq4d showed us this long island model home that was made with a 3d printer we should be able to do our part of the build in about eight days or less so what does it mean to print a house well a robot stacks layers upon layers of concrete literally building from the ground up sq4d is constructing a similar residence nearby that's already for sale the three-bedroom 1400 square foot house is listed for 299 thousand dollars homes of comparable size in the area come with a price tag around a hundred thousand higher and often much more of course the printer can't do all the work it can build about 40 percent of the structure and then workers have to do the rest but even that forty percent can drastically lower construction costs this process can save you about twenty to thirty percent on an overall build other home builders are using 3d printers as well the company icon in texas works with non-profits to provide low-income housing mighty buildings in california offers homes that range from studios to three bedrooms the company's co-founder says doing it in a warehouse gives them flexibility we've developed a unique technology we can print unique geometries we can do curves we can do free form sq4d claims they've already received more than a thousand offers to purchase the home a possible indication consumers are ready to accept this new dimension in construction kathy wood often says that during times of turmoil businesses are more likely to try new ways to solve their challenges innovation thrives when more people are willing to adopt new technology in my opinion that's true of individuals as well a 20 to 30 percent cost reduction for a home is nothing to sneeze at but like every other disruptive technology that number is just the beginning listen to this next clip from the b1ms video titled why this 3d printed house will change the world in it perry the company behind the first fully permitted and certified 3d printed building in germany talks about their integrated planning process before printing the structure of the house and what it saved them in terms of labor costs on-site mistakes and material waste perry also engaged a number of the core trades on these projects a critical hurdle that few other 3d printed buildings have attempted to cross with services and other works already coordinated with the structural design errors on site have been almost completely eradicated saving time money and waste material while the savings may be modest here they'd soon add up across an entire estate or housing development what kind of real world savings have you seen on this project so far this really this integration of of other trades has a huge impact so we've had the election come into one of these buildings and he walks around and says well guys you know i'll be saving up to like 12 days in here um so we are saving a lot of labor in other trades because there's in the buildings we're executing there's not going to be a single slot that has to be cut nobody's gonna have to drill a hole for a power outlet though the design of these buildings may feel relatively straightforward when compared to some of today's architecture the team are using the lessons learned to construct larger structures in a variety of forms with german building certifications now under their belt the team are planning more projects using different materials and with a focus on further reducing waste that last part adding up savings across entire housing developments is my ultimate vision for 3d printing here's what that could look like a whole community can be planned out beforehand and designed in a scalable way so more homes can be added down the road it can also be designed in a way that minimizes the expensive infrastructure involved the amount of pipes and lines that run beneath the ground just as one example this means that you can design a 3d printing template for an entire community not just individual buildings providing a whole new level of cost savings savings based on the reduced labor and material waste for each building individually and savings based on optimizing the design of the community and its infrastructure as a whole while benefiting from economies of scale by the way this could also be how we do it on mars that's the big idea don't believe me dubai wants to 3d print 25 of every new building by 2025 not just the structures of the buildings themselves the plan is to start small doorknobs hinges door and window frames railings for stairs and balconies benches and so on before moving on to more elaborate assemblies like sinks and tubs office desks and cabinets and that's the last piece of the puzzle in my opinion mass adoption of this big idea will come from companies 3d printing all of the little widgets in our homes and offices today as we all get more exposure to 3d printing by virtue of owning and using more 3d printed products in our everyday lives demand will naturally continue to rise and supply will rise to meet it lowering overall 3d printing costs in the process thanks to wright's law and as the technology matures the size and scope of the parts that get 3d printed will go up in addition the amount of a building's structure and infrastructure that gets 3d printed will go up exponentially as cost due to labor and wasted material continue to go down the bigger the building the more impact to the bottom line this will have slowly forcing commercial construction companies to incorporate this new building process or be disrupted by the ones that do and finally all of those 3d printing processes will make their way into the residential sector sometimes one building at a time and sometimes by printing entire communities and of course all of the other great applications that arc invest has been pounding the table on for years aerospace auto healthcare biomaterials semiconductors and beyond when it comes to 3d printing the only limits are costs time and whatever designs you can dream up and in my opinion archinvest's only mistake on 3d printing is not dreaming

sick what oh wait wait okay was i supposed to hit that or not i got x3 i think there's like the bigger multipliers or at the very end so you gotta like avoid the small multiplier oh okay yo i'm looking like uh i'm looking like the guy from mcdonald's you know i love that guy me and that guy best friends me and the purple guy okay here we go dude [Music] i just instantly oof yeah if you become too small of a blob that you ooh i wanted to see what it looked like if he goes through like the cheese grater but i just gotta buy it okay dude i'm tiny dude this game is so sick oh no he lost his legs oh no no he's crawling for yeah we were thinking the same thing i was like me crawling to the fridge at 3am okay i'll get the five i'm gonna get the five okay yeah so you get smaller as you go through the air at the end so you gotta decide where you wanna stop okay okay watch out for the blasters go go go go go okay okay nice good job whoa whoa oh he's like snowboarding i've got i lost my head that's okay that's okay no we're huge we're huge we're looking big we're looking big we're looking big biggest blob ever i think i can go for the 10 this time i think so i think so okay get the multiplier get the multiplier and yeah you like lose some of your blob as you like fly yes yes wait did we get it huh he said oh yeah yo i think you were just too short that's okay we'll get it this time adam now i'm not i'm not gonna i'm not gonna leak anything but this little this little gooey guy kind of reminds me of adam after the boober incident well you don't currently but look guys i can't say anymore adam's mom made me promise not to say but yeah it looked similar to this oh but you keep bringing it up in videos it's okay it's okay it's okay okay here we go can i get the ten he

"K0X5A6aURms": "i know this one at least among us the game to play among us we're playing among us but among us among us so everyone on the entire internet is playing among us right now and if you're living under a rock and you somehow don't know what among us is here's the basics there's 10 players and two of them are evil imposters to win the game you must figure out who the imposters are but the imposters can win by killing everyone else it's basically mafia but for gamers now since i made fall guys recently i'm gonna take a break this week and chill out for a bit so yeah we're gonna make among us and uh make it a 3d game instead of 2d okay so the first thing we need to do is create the player model now i'm not really known for my modeling skills actually i'm not really known for anything but fortunately for us the player model is just a bean so even i should be able to pull this off and after spending a bit more time than i would like to admit we now have a bean with glasses and a jet pack so i got our jetpack bean into unity and then i did some googling found some code for a toon shader our tomb shader the toon shader is made by daniel illette and it gives our game a sort of 2d art style kind of look which i'm totally vibing with so yeah check out daniel he's got a tune of cool shader tutorials [ __ ] me and before going any further i set up everything in an organized list because that makes me look like i know what i'm actually doing which uh i don't so yeah so i got some basic player movement into the game allowing you to move around now i just joined the movement from my game carlson which saved me a lot of time and oh you're wondering what carlson is well i'm glad you asked carlson is just a game i'm working on which is currently the 20th most wish disney game on steam we're trying to get to the number one spot so make sure your smash wishlist now gamers currently though you're just a grey bean moving around but uh we'll fix that later as a wise man once said beans now since we have movement we need something to move around in and among us has three different maps so we're gonna recreate the one called polos mainly just because it has a lava pit you can throw people into and uh yeah honestly i just want to throw some of my friends and some red boys into the lava pit because red voice so i got to work on straight up cloning and st recreating the map yeah now this is a pretty quick process using pro builder and i've had tons of practice lately since i've been working a lot on making maps for my game carlson now carlson is a gamer and after a while we now got the basic map down now it looks really boring for now but we'll spice it up soon we also need a mini map and if you don't know what a minimap is it's basically just a small map so i made a circle and then using a sprite mask we can just mask the map inside of the circle then we keep track of the player's c rotation and apply it to the minimap and finally we do the same thing for the player's position and tara minimap yeah it's still just a small map okay so one of the most iconic things in among us is when you kill another player i like it kajii friend straight up just chop their body in half leaving only a big bone sticking out it's almost as big as your mo always drink your milk for big and healthy bones gamers okay so this should be pretty simple uh let's see here literally just chop his body in half yeah check a big fat bone in there and voila we're we're done i mean listen i'm not supposed to give my personal opinion here on this channel but is it just me or is that bone looking kind of thick now we also need to make the kill look a bit more juicy so we're gonna add some particles using unity's particle system a great system for making parts and here is the result you can now go shop shop and enemy go bye bye i'm also gonna be making some sound effects for this using my mouth which is gonna make it even better hopefully but first i made some ui icons in photoshop so i was pretty happy with these icons and didn't realize anything was wrong until my man spoo pointed it out a backward cue so apparently i don't know how to draw a cue correctly but i mean listen i was never the sharpest being in the drawer okay don't judge me and i mean who cares which way the cue goes it's irrelevant it doesn't matter you so anyway you can now use tasks you can you can kill people you can report dead bodies which will take you to the meeting where you can talk and lie to your friends and then throw them in a pool of lava as you do because you hate your friends good vibes how are you so bad just feel bad i'm losing my mind so we got the basic gameplay done and the shape of the map is also finished so it's time to make it look better i found a couple of free textures from c60 and got to work on adding details and materials to the map we also need some props and objects to place around the map so first i made a box and then i made a locker and then i realized i am terrible at making models and then i started questioning my entire existence so i headed over to google poly instead and downloaded a bunch of free models i placed them all over the map and added some tiny details here and there and it now looks much better also yeah that's a giant drill don't ask why we uh we don't speak about the drill around these parts okay so we're pretty much done now right psych now it's time to actually turn it into a multiplayer game so you can play the game with others but i have done this several times already with other games and among us is a really simple game right so this should be a walk in the park i was wrong i haven't slept in three days a code a lot of code i want to commit die but hey it's it's kind of working now you can you can walk around you can see other players walk around you can kill them you can have meetings and more i also added a bunch of scuffed tasks which are just kind of bad versions of the original ones but hey they get the job done they're like switches there's like a billion switches in this game but usually now we're almost finished but we still need some sound effects and the most iconic one is of course when you chop off the head of other players so let's get to work now there's water everywhere then we just apply a little bit of sound editing magic and when i say a little bit i mean a ton to make it go from this to uh to this it's not a 100 like the original version but i think it sounds pretty good i also added some walking and ambient sound effects and uh here it all is in action and for the final touches we need a main menu so uh let's uh let's see here i'm among us and uh yeah there we go scuffed edition all right boys looking pretty good finally let's just polish some of the rough edges fix a little bit of code and this should be done pretty quickly there's so many errors so many small things that don't work so much networking and finally boys after like one and a half weeks of work we have created walmart among us in 3d the server is simply a linux file so i just chucked it into a google server and got that baby up and running with some cool ass hackerman text and we can now connect to the server from across the world get into a lobby ready up and once all of the players are ready one or two players are made imposters and we can enter the game now before i show you some of my 9 million iq gameplay you probably want to play this for yourself now because of legal reasons i cannot release this game unless i get permission and if i get permission you should be able to find a download in the description as well as a video informing you how to set up a server and actually play the game so i'll keep you updated in the description down below now keep in mind it's 100 understandable if they don't allow me to publish the game from their perspective i'm just some random idiot who stole their game and made it 3d so yeah it's totally understandable and if you want to play among us just buy the game it's like five dollars i think it's super cheap if you want to play the game just go to steam and buy it it's that simple okay cool but with that being said uh here's my 9 million iq gameplay also make sure to smash subscribe for more garbage yeah well we're like six imposters get them boys get them boys mash up found it didn't we have cess on him before that's just that's just unfortunate circumstances that's that's the most stressed thing i've ever heard you know what to do boys it's painfully obvious [Music] so me and duke were imposters last time so i feel like i can trust him this round i'm outside the window staring in hello [Music] oh [ __ ] i'm in poster let's go uh yeah [Music] i just watched snazz walk past me uh in the hall and then like literally found him like five steps away yeah but where's the button oh electrical like it must have been right behind me did anyone see jade i think we should skip because it's too early but we should just all right let's keep an eye on snap then and but also strategy psychology dude my brain hurts [Music] [Music] you gonna tell me what happened there what happened what happened that's not what happened yes okay the body is outside of camp i'm outside the window just staring in and are just looking at the body oh no oh dude listen i was in the window i see literally murdering uh as sidious and uh he was with us yeah it was i was looking at the camps i didn't see uh yeah but i turn around and there's a body so you said you can kill through walls though right because right outside no it was it was oh yeah it was definitely uh because he was he was in o2 yes okay remember remember you see me at a weapon so like by uh yeah yeah yeah like i walk up to lights the lights get like fixed i'm looking for the fence i don't remember who does lights i'm going to skip i have no idea you came last year 100 days no no no i was i was doing lights and then i i saw i saw spoo kill someone in in camps i just got them you'd definitely kill it i i'm confirmed [Music] [Music] yes absolutely dude if we win this game no way all right we just gotta murder like uh two more people i think and there you go why didn't they vote me off emergency here's the story i i i was walking towards the lights to fix the lights and then i see purse running away from like a blue body i'm pretty sure that was sport all right i got my vote i was i was like okay don't kill me dude i was playing team deathmatch i was killing everybody by the way i literally have no idea what was that i was playing team deathmatch thanks a lot for watching make sure to smash like if you like smash dislike if you don't and subscribe for more trash also remember to drink your milk hit billy and

usually a pretty simple project it's a box with best case uh a port included or integrated into it what we're gonna do today is different this is yes this is also a 3d printed enclosure for a speaker but it's also using a 3d printed driver this is paul ellis's fd52 which is as close to fully 3d printed of a speaker driver as it gets it also uses a 3d printed passive radiator in the back and of course this entire enclosure is also printed so this is as close to a fully 3d printed speaker as it gets by the way if you're wondering how i keep the music consistent through these cuts what you're hearing is the output of this actual speaker it's just that i've pre-recorded it beforehand i don't want to jump quite through music so let's get this thing printed i'm going to walk you through the build and print process for this driver and for the enclosure as well the driver is pushing what we can do with our filament-based printers to the limit it's using flexible materials this is ninjaflex it's using single walled petg prints this is colorfab xt and everything about this is just at the very edge of our printers can do and i find that really interesting because it's challenging but it's also not totally impossible on a normal printer so we're going to print this today let's get going and this video is sponsored by elegoo and their neptune 2 3d printer at an affordable price it comes with a flex pad and color touchscreen with print previews and if you want to tinker and upgrade it's largely compatible with mods designed for the end of 3. i'll be using the neptune 2 for the pla prints in this project check it out at the link in the description below [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] easy [Music] so now the speaker is built and it is ready for testing i'm powering this off of my like experimental mini speaker setup which is in function very similar to this it's got a battery system on there a charger a dsp and an amplifier and i'm using the dsp to tune in the sound of these speakers but we're also going to measure the speaker and see what the numbers say how this thing performs and i can then base the dsp tune off of what i'm measuring so the first job is to delete the profile for this mini speaker off of the dsp and get a flat eq profile on here so that we can measure what this driver does and what the speaker does without any external help [Music] [Music] hmm with the frequency response of the speaker measured i can start building an eq profile for this specific enclosure driver and passive radiator combination the goal is to have a mostly flat frequency response you can't really compensate for every single peak and valley but you can get the general profile as flat as possible so what i'm going to do is i'm going to extend the high end a bit by boosting those upper frequencies i'm going to take out that peak around 200 to 300 hertz so that we get rid of that warbly boomy sound and i'm going to extend the low end a bit by boosting those very low frequencies which is the same range where the passive radiator should help us with a bit of boost i'm also going to add in a super bass block which yes is kind of cheating it's kind of distorting the low end but to be honest uh small speakers without that just sounds super thin it's not going to be totally accurate anymore but to be honest a small speaker like this is never going to be 100 accurate so i'd rather have it sound good to my ears than for it to be technically totally perfect so let's get this flashed to the dsp take a quick measurement of the before and after and of course we're going to take a listening test to it as well [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] now i don't know how that sounded to your ears but honestly i am extremely happy with how this turned out now obviously a commercial speaker one did you buy for example these these pc68s that i've got in here they are still a bit better but i'm actually really surprised by how close this pretty simple 3d printed driver got to a commercial offering and mass-produced offering like this now obviously paul elling polymath 3d uh he's still working on all these different driver variations this ft52 isn't the only one he's got he's also got bigger drivers he's got some that he's put all the learnings from this smaller fd 51 and 52 series into and paul has already released some of those models on his patreon so if you want to check it out the link to that is in the description below now as always the fascinating thing is that 3d printing just gives you the tools to iterate on things like this quickly you don't have to go to a manufacturer to get your your prototypes built and to get you know parts for stuff and wait for iterations you can literally you know design something check it on the printer over there check it out the printer and have your prototype hours later instead of having to wait weeks for an iteration and i think there is still lots to come for these 3d printed speakers and 3d printed drivers in this case the ft51 and fd52 eventually are open source and free design so if you want to try that out you can do that as well these are pretty cheap to make they do take a bit of effort but honestly if you have a small speaker project that you want to do in a budget these are well worth looking at also the passive radiator that you know is basically just a side product of the speaker development that paulie is doing i think these are fantastic and if you look at this speaker you know the pc68 are like eight bucks or something and the passive radiator that go with it are 10 bucks so these are crazy expensive for what they are and if you can just print them that obviously makes building speakers a lot more accessible and a lot cheaper overall so i'm very excited about how well this entire thing turned out i'm also very excited about what is still to come here now if you want to try and print this exact speaker as well you can obviously download all the files for that in the description below be warned my enclosure design is very sloppy and it does take a bit of silicone to put it together but hey if you want to try it be my guest and the only reason i can do designs in projects like these are because of my awesome patrons thank you all who are already supporting me if you want to check out how you can support this channel as well uh link is in the description and obviously also the link to paul's patreon is in the description as well if you want to support his private designs which made this entire thing possible in the first place so thank you all for watching um get subscribed if you want to see more projects like this i know i keep saying this but just you know subscribe do it

when 3d platformers are either the resurrected corpses of dead franchises or whatever this is going to be return to the comforting warmth of the series that defined the genre and the strangely proportioned fictional plumbers you love more than your own parents super mario 3d world and bowser's fury discover one of the best mario games you've probably never played unless you bought a wii u basically for this game and experience a new game that blends some of the best stuff from classic mario together into a new adventure featuring the world map from mario 3 and the character selection from us mario 2 where you just pick peach every time because her hover is broken with some fun touch gimmicks from galaxy and a handful of new ideas like the overpowered catsuit or the double cherries which open up brand new fan fiction opportunities such as mario having a foursome with himself and just the right amount of captain toad levels which it turns out is not a whole game who's only real downside is that they went isometric and took away most of the camera control making it feel like you're playing a shoebox diorama of mario and screwing up your depth perception even more than these games normally do experience the classic eight world mario adventure through ice fire and castle levels that you'll yaw and wahoo your way through on the road to freeing some fairies from bowser for whatever reason while collecting stars and stamps that range from laughably easy to ass clenchingly difficult as you play either casually by yourself or in a chaotic mad dash with your friends where the main challenge is figuring out what the [ __ ] is happening until you finally dethrone the terrible turtle and unlock the bonus levels where the funtime romp of the first eight worlds turns into a brutal crucible that will test your patience as much as your mario skills in a crushing four world gauntlet of brutality see they even got some japanese mario 2 in here for all you sickos out there that play mario maker levels designed like the traps from saw once you've called your way through 3d world's tribute to mario's past get a taste of a possible mario future with bowser's fury a bizarre little add-on that turns 3d world into a giant mario odyssey level and what kind of amounts to a mini mario open world game where mario is sucked into a strange cat centric pocket dimension where he teams up with everyone's favorite mario character bowser jr who is kind of realm from final fantasy 6 to bop around the map collecting shines from random levels in a big fully 3d map until shadow bowser wakes up and decides to roast your ass in the middle of one of them and you have to dodge giant fire blasts and falling rocks along with the usual level hazards until you can shine a lighthouse at him by climbing a tower in classic open world style or die or he just gets bored and leaves except for like the last half hour so where he's constantly farther up your ass than a colonoscopy in a bite-sized chunk of mario that kind of just makes you wish it were a full game but it's still a pretty cool thing since they definitely could have just sold a super mario 3d world again and you know

star damn it [Music] as the castle opened up castles opened up we'll go deal with that in a little bit luigi we gotta find this first star i don't know how i missed it but according to nintendo i missed the star somewhere so i guess i gotta be on the lookout pretty pretty early i suppose i have no clue where this star is at any bees seen a star [Music] it has to be like pretty early right i miss it's the first one it's the first one you can get apparently [Music] so where could it be [Music] [Applause] [Music] like it feels like i've already missed it oh it's up here it was up here all right i guess i went into this thinking this was probably optional or something and it was just up there the whole time whatever i got it i guess nintendo says i missed that star [Music] i don't know how i didn't take damage there that was pretty lucky also we don't even need to worry about these fences because luigi can very clearly just jump over them whenever he wants he doesn't give a [Music] i guess i'll just finish the level up again since all i really wanted was the one star out of here that was what i wanted to do the first time i came through this level but nintendo said nah [Music] oh all right beautiful basically speed running this level now bam extra coins beautiful [Music] can i jump up this without getting the oh get up there luigi oh come on he's not gonna be able to do it is he i wanted to be lazy and quick about it but it just ended up screwing myself over is there really another platform here oh come on [Music] this is what this is what i get for being impatient all right we're out of here we're out of here luigi let's move on don't even start headset i will replace you i don't want to replace you but i will oh i get to gamble let's go gamble luigi we're gambling hit the blocks and make the pictures line up you could win up to 777 coins you'll get an extra life for every 100 coins you collect i remember i think i used to be like good at this but i'm definitely like not good at this now okay that sucked oh come on i'm like one late every time yeah i matched two things a whole hundred coins oh boy i feel like i used to be better at that they make those faster they had to have made those faster right they've got to be going at least like quadruple the speed there's probably like a nice like timing thing you can do but i don't know i obviously don't have it down all right we've got a big water dinosaur to ride here i think what do you have to say do you say anything to me no i can just hit her with fire over and over again oh bouncing off the wall nice all right well let's just jump on this thing and get going then hop on plessy and head for the goal control your speed by tilting up and down on the left stick or the other stick i guess jump by pressing b or that button when playing with friends you'll find that you can turn faster and jump higher when everyone's working together well i'm solo so [Music] i'm probably gonna have to do this like a couple times too holy go pretty quick get a nice bounce oh yeah give me that star we got one star already looking good [Music] let me get these red oh oh i missed one come on i like should know you know i might i might have to do this a couple times to get all the stars i feel like i probably already missed one but i really only get one star out of all that oh hold on oh yeah look at that you can't get up there oh no all right plus he wanted to do their own thing there so you know i just couldn't control plessy anymore well i have one star so that's good i don't know where the other ones are at but all right note to self if you fall off the map you die i don't know why i didn't assume that in the first place but if you and plessy take the plunge then that's a death so maybe i should try to get this red uh these red coins again i like drifted too hard last time oh come on i didn't drift hard enough oh my god whatever better luck next time you know i'm going to have to come back probably so what could be up here oh life i need that oh come on really god damn it plessy i'm just gonna go this way i don't know how to get over there maybe you can just jump i'll try that a little later oh come on i missed the stamp too why is plessy so hard to control plus he's kind of tough doesn't really have the best handling on plessy i gotta say i think i jumped too early no i actually didn't jump too early all right well we did we did miss a star somewhere and by we i mean all of us i'm not taking the solo blame for this you guys definitely up just as much as i did so i don't want to hear anyone putting the blame solely on me you guys messed up too me getting the top of that flagpole though that was all me that was none of you guys so i take all the credit for the good stuff you guys take at least half the blame for the bad stuff that's how it works just like we didn't find the second star that was you guys up that wasn't me so now i got to do the level again because you guys didn't want to find the second star thanks a lot i have no clue where the second star is if i had to guess it's probably like i don't know hidden in a waterfall or like one of the places i didn't jump i have no clue obviously somewhere [Music] where exactly nobody knows i don't think anybody has ever found this star so i guess it's up to me to find it for everybody i mean it could i don't know what happens if you get all the red coins it just seems like a power-up not necessarily a star but maybe it is a star i have no clue oh look at that drifted drift in usa baby oh yeah that's a one-up i think there's just another one up at the top of this can i get it this time thank you i don't know if i had to guess like what is this does this go anywhere oh this actually does go somewhere oh  here it is hell yeah now i got a star man yeah i don't even have to jump we'll just kill these idiots we'll just kill them all perfect oh my god i missed a couple damn it oh well we came we got the big bucks we got the star the star was definitely the high profile item and now plus he just waves to us as we leave bye plessy give plessy a parting gift there and then we're out of here i still don't know why they just let you do that it's just like he tries to sprint but it just looks like he's just like ripping ass i don't know luigi's a little gassy not sure what made him that way probably all the mushrooms he eats i guess all the mushrooms and flowers he's eating might be giving him some digestive trouble you never know well we got that done there's also apparently some secret cave back here so i guess i'll check this out real quick oh we got the sweet super mario brothers 3 music again hell yeah i'm gonna listen to it for a little bit and also conveniently drink some water [Music] this little jingle is so good i will take the big one this time oh my god i'm punished for greed i'm out of here toad thanks for nothing apparently nintendo does not like it if you try to pick the big box they try to they try to punish you by letting you know you're greedy i'm sure it's like a 50 50 chance or something maybe not necessarily 50 50 but you can probably find a lot of stuff in the big box well i think we're generally done here does this tell me like how many stars there are for like each world and stuff okay oh here we go this is kind of what i wanted so this tells you like all of the levels with all of the stuff and all of the things okay that's kind of good to check out whatever well let's do the castle it requires 10 stars i'm pretty sure we have like 20. how many stars do i even have i guess we'll find out eventually i have a few stars it's about time i have to work on that line for luigi that wasn't that wasn't my best outing but it's about time we made it to the first stage we need to play a little rocket league [Music] rocket league is sweet i wish i was playing rocket league games like pretty hard too [Music] [Applause] oh come on [Music] it's like it's like easy to jump into but like extremely difficult to master like rocket league has so much advanced about it it's ridiculous [Music] rocket league has some crazy techniques and stuff and just like ball control car control in the air on the ground it's like there's wacky stuff going on in rocket league like how shiny and sparkly the water is look at that give me that stamp get this goomba tower the out of here goodbye [Music] oh i guess you need the cat outfit for this well thankfully i'm a cat thankfully i'm a luigi cat so i don't know what this is but this seems like a oh come on oh no [Music] uh i almost made it oh i'm out of control i was a little out of control there i want the coins damn it give me the coins i already died once i need coins so i can get more free lives i i only had one hit to go that's unfortunate [Music] i guess we'll see what's crack-a-lacking over here we got some thwomps we got where i came from [Music] oh all this time nice [Music] you guys want to go let's fight give me the goomba tower star how many goomba towers have stars like all of them [Music] oh hit that downfield oh yeah that was pretty cool it was a mushroom basically score free score right here [Music] i got all i got all the stars i think yeah i got the stamp we're good we're good to go fight bowser or whoever the hell is here [Music] oh bowser in the pimp mobile holy i forgot about the pimp mobile we got purple pimp bowser in the pimp mobile the koopa pimp mobile that's amazing oh we're messing up his pit mobile i hope he's got good insurance with his golden bumper seems a little too lavish bowser i don't know okay maybe i shouldn't attack the fire that he sprays out all right he's already dead that's it purple pimp bowser he's out of here that's the game thanks for watching everybody we'll be starting up bowser's fury real soon except wait bowser's dead so never mind every mario game is cancelled from now on thank you thank you for watching and we get paid [Music] bowser was smuggling gold coins in his pimp mobile so we get to reap a little bit of the riches that fell out of it when we blew it up are we the bad guys we're attacking bowser we're attacking bowser's car with like homemade soccer bombs oh beautiful there we go i hope i didn't have to collect her first no she breaks out when you get the flag i was like five to collect her first we just left her ass she just got left in bowser's castle if you were supposed to collect her first thankfully she breaks out when you when you get on the flagpole oh we got a bowser sticker yep miner sub boss bowser oh his car's like stuck up there that's kind of sad bring me to another world green grass fairy [Music] i think they're like all different colors aren't they i don't think they're all green well we got the luigi fairy maybe i should swap characters for like each world i don't know i like luigi though luigi's luigi's cool he's like a cool guy yeah the fairy in this world is yellow so oh i got luigi walks as a cat do they all walk like that we got two one should i swap characters or no i don't know i'm i'm liking luigi i'm gonna stick with luigi for conch door canyon luigi seems like he knows his way around conked or canyon i was hoping this would go lower [Music] i know in some of the mario games you can actually use quicksand to get to like some secret areas so remember that in like super mario bros 3. like oh real old-school [Music] there were at least there was at least one level where you could use some quicksand to get into like a secret area this is crack can i do anything with this it looks cracked like you could break it but uh that looks like death if i had to guess that's probably death [Music] was this can i sink in this does this go anywhere i'm probably gonna die trying to figure stuff out but [Music] it's fine what's a couple deaths you know a couple dozen deaths i can't like see anything where's the next star i guess we'll figure that out later we got a golden tube to go down apparently falling in that hole is death so i guess i'll just like jump back and [Music] forth i think there's a much better way to get coins out of this than what i'm doing oh yeah i didn't even get any out of that that was that seems like kind of a waste like it seems like i let a few two coins get by but whatever i'm a humble man i have no need for money in this world that's my story and i'm sticking to it [Music] go luigi quit messing around [Music] all for a thousand points oh i'm about to i'm about to like jump off the the stage and get myself killed well i've only gotten one star so far i feel like i maybe missed one somewhere we got a stamp over there it looks like i don't know where any of the stars are at there's a luigi underneath yeah luigi down there [Music] get some coins real quick you see that luigi look at that luigi right there see it it's kind of it's kind of dark and hard to see he's there damn it he's there you're having trouble seeing it i'm sure someone will point it out to you well i get the feeling i've missed the star somewhere but it's okay we'll we'll come back and look for it probably so i don't know if you can scale that wall so i guess i'll leave it oh come on really [Music] i'm kind of i'm kind of worried this i'm kind of worried about this little track here [Music] it's kind of spooked i gotta say a little bit spoofed [Music] oh no i should have made him hit the rest of those all right so i definitely need to make that bird hit these there's probably like a star under there if i had to guess maybe i can ground pound it i'm running out of time every stage i'm running out of time no i definitely i don't think i can do much with that let me get this time hell yeah 100 seconds dude that's exactly what i [Music] needed you really can't get up this really i'm totally up there what's up there yeah i can't i can't see a damn thing up here i guess they don't want me to actually be up here okay [Music] kind of kind of rude but all right here's the stamp that's the flagpole i definitely missed like two stars captain toad is here getting chased you got a star for me buddy oh bro yeah captain toad nice job brother thanks for the star all right well there's definitely a star i missed it might be in one of these blocks over here so i guess i'll have to come back and try to remember to not kill the bird oh this was a bad idea this was not the best idea all right yeah i'm running out of time it's fine i'm done i beat the stage [Music] meow if i had to guess that star is probably in one of those blocks i hope at least i hope it's in one of those blocks god i have to hit a there well let's go search for the blocks and hopefully that's where my missing star is at [Music] you can use amiibo during your adventure just hold left and tap an amiibo to your controller with a course to make something surprising happen check the guide section of the menu to learn more you won't be able to use amiibo when you're communicating with other nintendo switch systems keep that in mind i do have some amiibos somewhere i don't know where they're at i think they're like packed up somewhere i'd like a gaming watch amiibo i think i have a marth amiibo i have a ganondorf amiibo basically whatever characters i like playing in smash i have an amiibo of it i might have a nes amiibo i might not have a nest amiibo i don't really play his nes a whole lot i have a mario amiibo of course i'd say i probably have like i don't know half a half a dozen somewhere oh come on why would you do this to me i don't even have a backup power up go luigi we're speed running we're speed running luigi we just gotta get to that one place we have to go luigi oh now we're good please don't give me a mushroom oh come on [Music] i don't even lie let it go it stupid mushroom speed run we're speed running luigi look at this all right hopefully this is where my stars at oh hell yeah dude give me that see you later idiot what a helping me get the star now i'm out of here look at this speed run go luigi luigi he did it round of applause for luigi he's doing very well [Music] luigi's doing exceptionally well let me make sure i hit a this time so i'm not sitting on this bright ass big red screen [Music] all right well we got whatever this is let me check this out i don't know what this is but is this just another toad house oh it's a stamp it's a stamp house got the green fairy i just rescued okay that was a nice nice free stamp i guess they're handing out free stamps at this house that's cool [Music] and then they disappear all right we've got a bowser statue oh we need 15 stars for that how many stars do i even have like really i don't have 15 stars that's do i need to get 15 stars in this level because i have like yeah no i have way over 15. maybe i just need to beat the level like leading up to it no it says i can like go to it yeah just unlock it oh there we go i just unlock it i thought things would unlock automatically but you know that's my fault for assuming all i had to do was hit one button nearby and then it just unlocks the level so oh we're in the shadow level we got a shadow level can i make my shadow like jump on this stuff [Music] that'd be kind of cool hey let me up there oh oh come on there's no point to being up here oh there's a star somewhere oh there it is down the hall cool oh luigi never change luigi can i kill these with the cap i don't think so it looks like they just get kind of they get kind of bumped by the cat but that's about it you probably need fire to kill them fine to guess [Music] fine to guess maybe fire would be good against them they look kind of like liquidy so [Music] maybe the fire burns them up i like dang it oh god i almost died trying to do that  oh no i did hold wait a minute oh yeah that's what i meant to do baby look at that that's what i meant to do of course of course i meant to do that i was just trying to trick you into thinking i was about to die did it work i hope it works i was definitely about to die there though well i only have one star i feel like i've missed the star somewhere already but what is this there's like a turnip or some on this i have no clue i have no clue what this is live and let live i guess all this crap that should hurt me i guess okay well maybe i needed fire for that [Music] oh well that was all right we already got that out of there nice let's keep trying to move along and get the hell out of here what's back here what are you hiding back here oh no it's captain toad he's scared he's scared because of this like paper mario bowser cut out the out of here bowser how dare he scare captain toad like that captain toad is a national treasure damn it [Applause] why would a cut why would a cardboard cut out of like a paper mario bowser do that [Music] [Applause] all right we gotta try to get to the top of this flagpole can he do it yup he sure can perfect we got a stamp we got a good score well i don't know if it's good but i'm gonna assume it's good so i feel better another three star yeah we have 30 total stars already we're cruising oh we get the gamble some more dude you're playing alone you can press down to take snapshots of your adventure cannon oh we can take some snapshot we gotta take a picture we get to move till zoom in and out we can add a stamp oh look at this we can be like sideways luigi oh yeah i can like add i don't know how oh dude it's like yeah what the this is weird i have no dude oh online no i don't want to i won't play by myself damn it apparently you can take some sweet pictures and show everyone oh boy i can't wait to mess this up again well let's go ahead and try this okay that was what i was trying to get but okay yeah this is i'm never gonna do this did they make this harder they had to have made this harder right oh i got three leaves hold on oh i got four leaves look at that i downloaded it i downloaded it it's been downloaded oh you can like rock it back up after a butt stomp that's interesting [Music] all right well we've had quite the amazing first session of this i had some pretty good fun i don't know i was having fun i was having fun with the levels so when we come back next time we'll take on whatever the hell this is 2-2 that i unlocked required 15 stars to unlock it we did some gambling we've collected a lot of stars having a good time i hope we just running around doing whatever so when we come back next time we'll just keep taking on more levels thanks for watching i'll see you guys then", "WJePFwXsu18": "in super mario 3d world there are some levels where we have to use plessy in order to beat the stage to be exact there are five levels where plessy is needed the question is can we beat those levels without the water surfing dinosaur that's what we're gonna find out today but before we do make sure to subscribe because we're trying to hit 250k subs by the end of the year let's go the first time we encounter plessy is in world 1-4 plessy plunging falls when i jumped into the stage there was a huge problem this giant gate prevented me from proceeding and would only open when i jumped on plessy but of course that's not what i wanted so with modding i simply removed that gate making it possible to move on without blessing but before we move on i'd like to introduce you to today's sponsor monster legends monstro legends is a free to play mobile game which is available on both android and ios in the game there is hundreds of different monsters to collect you can even find a lot of your favorite youtubers like to do dream mr beast and many others you can beat two monsters to get new ones and it's a fun challenge to try to get them all you can take your monsters to battle after feeding them this will also upgrade them and make them even stronger even fury buzzer wouldn't stand a chance against these in the game you can find different pvp modes this goes from special dungeons to an awesome adventure map not only that but you can also fight in real time against all of your friends which i personally think is very fun monster legends also has new events every single week where you can discover and play new adventures make sure to download the game through the link in the description to get the following rewards worth 30 dollars 50 000 food the epic monster no orion and 300k gold with that being said let's continue with the video once the gate was removed i jumped into the water and to my surprise mario did not start swimming instead he started running with only his head peeking out from the so called water the plessy music also did not start playing because i wasn't riding her the gold rings could also still be collected without plessy mario could still run at full speed and do all his normal moves although all of that worked these boost bets didn't just like the water mario fell through and they did not activate for some reason they only worked when riding plessy i moved on collected some more rings and then encountered these enemies called splounders normally when bumping into them as blissy you get bounced back without blissey that did not happen and the splunkers died mario is just too powerful then i checked these small islands there was nothing special to them because i could still stand on those like usual afterwards i encountered this ledge and had to jump off so i did but because mario couldn't jump as far as plessy mario went off screen for a little while without plessy i was also able to go back instead of always going forward so we could check out some more of this area sadly nothing very interesting to find here in this area i tried to jump up this elevated platform but it was really difficult to say the least after a while i managed to do it and activated the red ring i tried to see if it was possible to collect all red coins without plessy but it wasn't at least not with mario as you can see i came across some more boost pads but this time on land unfortunately they did not work either i ran off to the next section of the level with all these waterfalls i tried to get this one up but without any power ups that was impossible so i lived without it then this section came up running through the waterfall was still possible but making the jump was not i died but i came back into the right way this time this was way easier and brought me to the last fall of the level sadly without blissey this part wasn't really that exciting as the boost pads didn't work and i could simply keep running in a straight line then the ultimate mega super duper jump came up i jumped off and well yeah mario started falling of course the fall was way more slow than on plessy's back i bet mario was like [Applause] at the bottom the water was actually water so i had to swim for this last section i jumped into the pipe came out the other side and jumped on the flagpole so this level was possible to complete without plessy but i went back with a cat suit to do some more experimenting mario could still climb walls but as you can see he could also seemingly climb on thin air well it's just an invisible wall here is even more clear to see and no climbing waterfalls is no problem for mario climbing the wall here made some parts of the screen glitch out because i wasn't supposed to look here but the most interesting thing is yet to come at this section i climbed this wall and clipped into it at a certain height i could also climb a little bit further and again the game glitched out a bit with that being said let's continue to the next stage the second time we encounter plessy is in world 5-1 after collecting a checkpoint there is a short section where we need her normally you fall in place when exiting the pipe and there's no way to avoid that but with my 200 iq brain i moved plessy away from under the pipe making mario land on the ground now i could continue without her the camera needed some time to start following me but eventually it did once again the plessy music did not start playing this level was quite easy the only obstacles being splunkers which could be avoided easily and the moving bridges which were hard to miss at the end i challenged myself to get this stamp but once again easy peasy the only thing left to do was touch the flagpole so this level was possible without blessing 2. the third time we encountered plessy is all the way in world bowser dash 2. this level is a sand level instead of a water level once again there was a huge gate preventing me from continuing so i removed it the beginning section of this level was a huge leap and it took quite a while to hit the ground the sand wasn't actually the ground and it acted just like the water in the previous stages i jumped and ran down this section and the camera glitched out at this specific spot making it possible to look underneath the stage i continued and came across this huge structure normally you just jump in with plessy but now i was able to climb on it to my disappointment there was nothing special up here then i had the idea to jump off from here to potentially skip the entire stage but there was a death barrier come on nintendo next i tried using a tanuki suit with it i could skip the entire first section of the level and almost make it to the top of the structure so i fell down like i was supposed to and once again the fall took quite a while this part of the level used dashbats but by now you know the drill they don't work i moved on and stumbled upon this huge jump luckily i already had the tanuki suit because without it and without plessy this jump was not possible to be made even with a suit it was close then this section came up i knew there was a hidden path with cloud platforms to the left so i tried to take it but somehow fell through the clouds this happened because as i said before the ground mario standing on is lower than the sand itself so instead of walking on those clouds i simply walked into the side of them and fell off i tried again without being dumb and i managed to do it next up were a lot of descending platforms and jumps but this was very easy to navigate through and before i knew it i reached the end i jumped into the war box slid down the slope and finished the stage easy the fourth encounter of plessy is also in world bazaar this timer will bowser dash 5. here we can find plessy in the second half of the stage this level normally has a gate but i removed that one as well at first the water was crowned again but then it became actual water and mario started swimming oh yeah the camera just stayed in this position the entire time for some reason i could see mario for the most part but after a while i couldn't anymore and had to go with my gut feeling when i came close to the end the camera suddenly moved too from here i just had to make it to the end of the level and that's what i did this level was possible as well [Music] the absolute last time we encountered plessy is in world star dash 1. once we reach the checkpoint of the level we also reach blessy i removed the gate and started running this plessy section was the shortest out of all of them and also the easiest with little obstacles and no ways to die i made it in no time then i reached the flagpole and finished the stage so that answers the question we can finish all plastic levels without actually using her once again i want to thank monster

be thinking seeing this video. You can buy clay pots relatively\u00a0\ncheaply in your local flower shop. However, there are many cool\u00a0\ntricks that 3d printing enables when it comes to gardening. From self-watering planters and inserts to propagating stations avocado boats to grow light holders and oddly shaped pots to interesting plant supports and pots that also work as an art piece to IoT projects and smart planters... As it usually is with 3d printing,\u00a0\nyour imagination is the limit. Self-watering planters With traditional pots, it's not easy to\u00a0\nguess how much water your plants need. Having a planter with holes on the bottom and a tray beneath it makes it a lot easier. If the tray is empty you know that\u00a0\nthe plant needs watering soon. And maybe more importantly, it's nearly\u00a0\nimpossible to overwater the plant because the water has an escape route. The downsides are that A) you\u00a0\nmight not like the way it looks especially indoors. And B) it doesn't really solve the problem of you\u00a0\nhaving to actively water the plant quite often. Unless you buy or print a really big tray. That's where self-watering planters come in. It's basically the same concept\u00a0\nbut instead of a planter and a tray it has two shells with a cavity in between them which works as a water reservoir. The outside shell must be watertight. On the other hand, the inside shell is not and it pulls the water from the reservoir through small holes or with the help of a wick. The capacity of the reservoir\u00a0\ncan typically be quite big so you only need to fill it about once a week and the plant just continuously pulls\u00a0\nthe perfect amount of water upwards. Yes, there are plants that do\u00a0\nnot like self-watering planters. For example cacti. But most of them do, especially\u00a0\nherbs, tropical plants or vegetables. You can download this self-watering\u00a0\nplanter from PrusaPrinters. Links for all of the models in this\u00a0\nvideo will be in the video description and in the linked blog article. Commercially available self-watering\u00a0\nplanters can be quite expensive and the selection is pretty limited, so here\u00a0\nyou might even save some money by printing one. What's cool is that you can use a\u00a0\ntraditional pot as the outer shell and bring just the self-watering insert. Trying to buy one that would fit your\u00a0\npot perfectly would be very difficult. But with 3d printing, you can just rescale\u00a0\nthe model in the slicer to the correct size and that actually leads us to point number two. Make it the perfect size! One of the biggest advantages of 3d printing pots is that you can make them in\u00a0\nany shape and size you want. Instead of going to several shops\u00a0\nonly to buy a traditional round pot that just sort of fits where you need it to, you can print a rectangular pot that will\u00a0\nfit perfectly between your double windows or on your windowsill. Flower pot = art piece? Not only can we print the pots in any size but also in any shape that we want. Sure we try to avoid using\u00a0\nsupports, but other than that, the possibilities are nearly endless. You can go for a classy look or do fun twists of an object from\u00a0\nyour favorite movies or a game. Either way, you'll end up with an unusual pot that becomes a great conversation topic every\u00a0\ntime a fellow green thumb visits your home. When you're printing the pot you can pick\u00a0\nany of the available filament colors. The selection is really huge these days so matching the color of your pots\u00a0\nand the color of your curtains, couch or a painting is easy. And some filaments, like\u00a0\nour Prusament Galaxy Black, have a distinct look that you simply\u00a0\nwon't find in any gardening store. You can emboss or deboss labels to your plant pots or simply plant small stand-alone\u00a0\nlabels, if you have a bigger garden. Grow Lights Depending on where you live\u00a0\nand the plants that you own you might want to consider\u00a0\nexperimenting with some grow lights. They often have a characteristic purple color since the most important wavelengths\u00a0\nfor plants are blue and red You can get them in various forms, but our favorite is a good old LED strip. Generally, you shouldn't\u00a0\nleave grow lights on 24 7. Plants need a light-dark\u00a0\ncycle to develop properly. But you can buy a cheap plug-in\u00a0\ntimer switch or a smart switch to have the lights automatically turn\u00a0\noff for a few hours during the night. Like all artificial light sources,\u00a0\ngrow lights also generate heat. So it's best to place them\u00a0\nin an aluminum led profile, which will provide passive cooling for them. We designed a simple holder for such led profile, which attaches to a planter box. We split the sides into multiple segments, which enables us to quickly adjust the\u00a0\nheight of the light as the plant grows. You'll find the finished model on PrusaPrinters. But in this case, it's probably best\u00a0\nto download the original drawing and modify it a little bit for your\u00a0\nplanter box and for your led profile. Growing a plant from leftover fruit\u00a0\nseeds will give it a fun backstory. However with some plants,\u00a0\nlike avocados and mangoes, this can be quite the challenge. If you search for a guide online, you'll most likely end up sticking\u00a0\na bunch of toothpicks in the pit and partially submerging it in water. However, you'll have to\u00a0\ncontinuously keep refilling it and the pit will be less and\u00a0\nless submerged over time. And it can often take weeks\u00a0\nbefore the sprouting happens. 3d printing to the rescue! If you print a boat for the pit, it will be submerged the same way the whole time. As the water evaporates the boat\u00a0\nwill simply go lower as well. And once you move the plant into soil, you can simply reuse the boat\u00a0\nfor your next sprouting project. What's maybe even more fun is to pick a plant, that will produce more fruits when homegrown. All you need is one chili pepper that you like, crush it, extract the seeds and then\u00a0\nyou can fill small 3d printed cups with soil for the one seed. Those are made from Prusament Neon Green. You can either germinate the seeds in a wet paper\u00a0\ntowel or you can do it directly in the soil. You could print the seed starter\u00a0\nwhich is basically a small greenhouse. But in this case it probably makes more\u00a0\nsense to just buy cheap of the shelf one. You can see more grow lights in action here. And also you can see why we\u00a0\ndon't print led holders from PLA. It will deform because of the heat. And then we just let nature do its thing. Plant propagation is a million-year-old lifehack. You can cut an existing plant, place\u00a0\nit in water for a few days or weeks and it will start growing roots. You can use just an ordinary\u00a0\nglass to propagate your plants. However, just like with avocados, the\u00a0\nwater will evaporate rather quickly. The plant will also move a bit as it\u00a0\ntries to orient itself towards the sun. And sometimes this can lead to leaf\u00a0\ngetting submerged and rotting away. Lastly because glass exposes all\u00a0\nof the water to direct sunlight, algae will start growing in it. None of these is really a big problem. But it does leave some space for improvement. You can print yourself a\u00a0\nfancy propagating station. It has a big water reservoir\u00a0\nand a few slots for net cups. These printed cups can be filled\u00a0\nwith rock wool or a similar medium and they'll hold the plant nicely straight up. As a finishing touch, you can\u00a0\nadd a few grow LEDs to the top. The height of the top arch is\u00a0\nadjustable by insertable standoffs. As always, you'll find the model on PrusaPrinters If you like playing with\u00a0\nArduino and other electronics, there are a lot of fun\u00a0\nprojects that include plants. You can start with monitoring the soil humidity and changing the color of a flower pot stand. If you use a board with networking capability, such as the esp8266, you can log the values online and send fun emails. You could even add a small water pump that\u00a0\nwill automatically water the plant when needed. There are many uses for 3d\u00a0\nprinting in combination with plants and we just glanced over some of them. If you've already used 3d\u00a0\nprinting for a gardening project, we'd love to see pictures of your prints. so tag us on Twitter. And if you haven't, the\u00a0\ngrowing season is just starting so why not give it a shot? Happy printing!", "8-Zg5XZoc_w": "hello neighbor sister is back and she is still an absolutely terrible person so let's prank her hello everybody i am kindly keen and welcome back to mobile monday we are returning to scary teacher 3d miss t is back slash hello neighbors sister and we've got some new levels to check out we're starting out with this one called peculiar circumstances i have a feeling it has something to do with birds turn miss t's simple cleaning routine into a full-fledged bird attack no one can stop me with these special shoes if only those stupid birds would disappear to hush you that was the weirdest conversation i have ever listened to francis is her boyfriend's name right i think it is he was moving his mouth but there was no sounds coming out of it and miss t was just talking about how amazing her new shoes are or something i don't know place seeds on miss t's hat seeds where am i gonna get seeds you think there's seeds like somewhere out here that would make sense like near the garden would would be the place where i would put seeds i will grab stars even though i don't really need them maybe in the shed or actually has this trash can always been here i don't i don't remember boy it's been a long time since we've played scary teacher 3d i'm glad that we're back wait what why does the door handle look like that uh okay that's new she locked the shed so maybe if i i go around that makes me want to get in the shed even more now so i need to no what so it's like glued or something so i need to figure out a way to to get into the the shed oh i can just open the windows well okay that's kind of stupid easy but i can't get in there though oh gosh maybe i can crouch jump maybe if you no okay i need to get on top of these hedges okay i've made it to the top of the hedges now i'm hoping that i can just crawl into the window from here i don't know if this is gonna work i'm gonna try though let's see just no okay you know what i need a hint reveal the seeds are in the basement i'm in the wrong place not even looking in the right building figures very typical now hopefully the basement door isn't glued shut that would be very annoying it doesn't look like it is okay good so we've made it into the basement and we should be able to collect our seed here there you go bird seeds okay place these seeds on miss t's hat okay if i was miss t where would i keep my hat probably in my bedroom so now we just need to find miss t's bedroom oh gosh she's chasing me in some ways being chased is actually kind of helpful because you move faster when you're being chased uh i'm so smart let's try to find miss t's lovely hat there's those shoes she was talking about um oh wait what okay i don't know what that was supposed to accomplish but i did something there i still feel like we need to do more with that though there's there's definitely more to this first we gotta find this hat i'm gonna grab this glue just in case we need it later it feels like something that that maybe we will use does she keep her hat in her rock out room no she does not ah that's a hat yes that's a lovely hat make sure miss t doesn't find out i don't i don't know what that means maybe if we glue it no maybe we need like scissors i really i really have no idea how do we hide the seed that is now on the hat i think it's safe to say that i need more hints so let's reveal a hint use paint to make fake grips what's that even mean what's a oh no oh no she figured it out no she knows she knows she just wiped off the seeds okay so we need paint where do we get paint i would think that we would get paint from the shed but i can't get into the shed okay okay so we missed a step the first time we we're supposed to put glue on the hat first and then we put the seed and then we have to figure out how to hide the seed tamper with mist special shoes what today the shoes are in the gym remove the grip from shoes i already i already did that though wait what what about the paint on the hat do i not need to do that because i glued the seed to the hat i oh gosh okay this is i'm getting very confused i think i'm gonna fail here make sure miss t doesn't find out what does that mean use paint to make fake grips paint is in the shed of course it's in the shed but how do you get into the shed the sheds right here maybe we can go in through the front window i do see the paint i do see it can't get in through there okay uh we can open this window and then we can't we can't jump in there find a way to melt ice that's what's holding the doors closed oh my gosh this is so elaborate i need like a blowtorch or something you got one of those miss t probably keep it in the shed maybe like a a candle or something like that or maybe salt can you use salt to melt ice i got a candle [Music] i don't think this is what we need i'm gonna try using the salt on the ice as weird as it sounds i'm gonna try it oh my gosh no what she was in the shed that's messed up miss t that is incredibly messed up okay so the the salt didn't work um but miss t can apparently just face through doors it's very impressive i need a hint use candle to melt ice so i was on the right track but the candle that i picked up turns out to actually be a firework very confused it does say that the candle is on the kitchen table okay so this is a different type of candle okay use the candle to melt the ice but don't i need to like light it on fire first right use the matches and then how do we how do we light the oh this is okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there we go okay we got the the burner going now we just come on man you just just need to light the candle in the fire it's not that hard to understand right come on game okay you know what i'm just gonna take an unlit candle to the ice maybe that's the secret please work oh okay use paintball to paint shoes oh no something doesn't seem right here i ain't go fast enough there's so much you have to do okay so my plan is to kind of do some of the prep work before we actually start like tampering with her stuff so like for instance i'm gonna open up the shed first and i'm gonna take the paint okay we've made it into the shed now this is the paintball that the game was talking about so do i need to like mix the two colors together maybe in the paintball so i put the red in there and then i put the green in there and is that supposed to make a color that looks kind of sort of like her shoes maybe i don't know about this i really don't know about this but let's do all the other stuff see if we can properly prank miss t alright so down into the basement we grab the seed and then we need glue we got the seed and then we head upstairs before miss t comes back inside she's heading back inside i don't like this and then i need to find the room that has the glue and the hat in it and i always forget where it is yeah okay it's not here i think the glue is in this room though oh it's in the same room okay well that's convenient all right good miss t is doing her cardio keep doing that so we put the glue on the hat then we put the seed on the glue make sure miss t slips when birds attack right so that's where the shoe situation comes into play right so we remove the the things that are supposed to make it so that she can't slip and then we paint over the shoes i don't know i don't know what's happening i'm just doing what i can this color does kind of look like those boots so okay make sure she doesn't find out paint it yeah what did did i do it did i do it right something about this tells me that this is not correct so i'm gonna go ahead and just see what the hints have to say use paint fake grips paint is in the shed i i did all that i skipped that part because i already knew maybe she's going to the shoes so let's see what happens let's just see here oh you stupid bird this is gonna be good and by good i mean terrible for her she's gonna fall off the roof isn't she his teeth gonna fall through [Music] turn miss t into a snowball even though there's no snow i'm very confused but that was awesome these pranks are getting more and more elaborate but they're also pretty hilarious keep an eye out for more because there's still more levels to check out [Music] careful", "PH6j1Cvq5ng": "[Music] [Music] well i really am the best chef in the world [Music] hi hi

game bro i'm i'm thinking i'm thinking we're gonna be able to get every single skin we're gonna get absolute max level right here yeah i think you're right now guys one thing i didn't know before about this game is that if you take your hand off the screen they stop so you running actually like you could time it like really well like if you if you want to like dodge an obstacle you can just take your hand off you don't even go to the boss you know what i mean wow that's a max level play that's a pretty good hack right there now hey we're looking pretty good i'm gonna get some coins and i think we're getting every single skin and we're going to be skipping to the skins in this game let's go nice upgrading i'm upgrading nice okay i don't really think that i don't know i feel like upgrading doesn't do that much in this game um but it's still real satisfying to do it yeah okay you gotta get max level that's true we have to hit max level uh i think when we get all the skins that's like basically max level oh nice that's nice like when you're at mcdonald's and you order like an extra large fry compared to the large like there's not really that much of a difference but you still want to get the extra there's a pretty big difference really especially yeah if you order about 10 of them which is what we do we go to mcdonald's we get one of everything on the menu just like how we're going to get one of every single skin in this game one of everything on the menu yeah yeah that's the that's the justy mcdonald's challenge bro that's a lot of food i mean that that's a light snack for me foxy oh no i lost the alien leader no now i should have let go of the screen and slow down uh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh boy oh boy this is not looking good bro ah but you did upgrade your guys so maybe you have a chance hold on guys hold on we can do it keep hitting no no we can't no we can't no he's dancing he's saucing on us stop it oh but at least you got a new skin you got a new skin that's true all right we got to beat that guy we got to beat that guy that's disrespectful his dance at the end was disrespectful yeah oh okay okay get this guy get this guy yeah um i wonder if your stick man with like the sword and the outfit on is more powerful than the normal stickman guys that you collect possibly bro i don't know oh nice nice oh nice got the speed boost oh cool we got the whole squad we got the whole squad goodbye goodbye mr wizard yeah get him out of here you evil wizard nice easy easy nice cool i'm thinking we could get some new skins honestly we're looking really good right now i think you're right we're looking really good okay we're getting some hammers i don't really know what the point of building

yeah really really shaking things up huh bro yeah mohawk rocky says i got a mo rod yeah definitely all right let's keep going let's keep going all right we're at level 22. i think we get to like level 30. i think we can get all the skins by level 30 honestly yeah that might be max level join clash for the potato hash i want some hash browns i think they have hash browns at mcdonald's though right they do yeah they do during breakfast but they don't have breakfast all nice day oh this is close oh this is really close oh wait wait wait one guy we got one guy with a sword and shield oh no oh no

lovers we are back and uh we're actually out here where we've been doing a hog hunt for the last few days with uh donut operator chuck liddell kentucky ballistics been a really fun time that video will probably be coming out a little bit later but today we're going to be shooting something that is honestly a little whack we're going to be shooting a plastic suppressor which is something that doesn't sound like it should work and honestly i'm still not sure if it will but there's a new company that is actually the reason why we're out here they they help sponsor a lot of this stuff and i think they're actually technically sponsoring this video uh but they are the mute the mute suppressor here is a new suppressor that is plastic it's super light it's uh it's a thick boy big big nice profile but uh it's entirely plastic and we're gonna shoot this on we're gonna work our way up we're gonna shoot it on a 22 first then move to a nine mil and then try it on five five six and see they claim because i would have thought like a 3d printed suppressor would melt or just blow up essentially but they claim that the kind of polymer that they used prevents heat transfer so let's put that to the [ __ ] test all right so first off we're gonna be shooting this on a ruger pistols this is a ruger mark 422 let's see what happens [Applause] [Music] [Applause] handle's 22 will it handle two mags of 22. still cold to the touch but 22 is pretty easy in fact a lot of 3d printed suppressors can do 22. what they can't do is when you add a little bit more pressure uh 22 is a super light round it doesn't move very fast pretty small not really a big problem so not ultimately surprised that this just survived and it's actually pretty decent quiet but so now we're going to move over the 9 mil which is where a lot of them start to have issues and if it can handle nine then we'll move up to five five six which has significantly more pressure as a rifle round so let's do it all right so now we've got a strybog nine millimeter direct blowback pcc got subsonic ammo in this one so hopefully this will be nice and quiet the mute polymer suppressor attempt with nightmare let it rip peacocks didn't seem to like that and you'd start to feel a little bit of heat here in the base but like that's like pushing it to call it warm i'm actually kind of surprised after a full magazine with some of the suppressors that i have the 9mm cans [Applause] you probably wouldn't want to start touching it after one mag so yeah supposedly that's why they can do it out of polymer so the type polymer that they're using doesn't hold on to heat like metal does so it's an interesting interesting little solution so like i'm not gonna lie i'm a little jaded now i don't really like shooting semi-auto that much but luckily i got a couple friends out here on the range who won't have a problem so scott donut i don't mind it's your ammo right so no it's not my ammo i can't afford nine [Music] yeah all right so that was pretty fast dude that's still like barely lukewarm down at the base dude that's insane that's your three mags and nine mil nice yellow shot mr gundam gear who the [ __ ] invited you out here man do you want to run one yeah why not let's look for mag yep yeah it's only been a few minutes since the last mag went through so in theory if it gets hot it'll still get hot nothing at all i mean you could hold that for eternity that's like lickable hot do it yeah they're not looking yeah so that's really not good tasting but yeah no it's it's genuinely not hot so that's pretty red absolutely but so nine mil still better than 22 as far as like you know it's way higher pressure it's obviously a lot more going on but 556 really where you're going to figure out whether or not this thing's going to hold up long term absolutely and i mean that's still a shorter barrel too so yeah for sure it's got some pressure but nothing like 556 is gonna have you know so let's break it can do it all right so now we have an ar-15 yeah i know there were there were no no aks available in five five six so yeah we we do we can but we're going to be testing it right now we've got what appears to be still case tula none of that fine wine [ __ ] only the uh only the ghetto [ __ ] around huh so today we uh yeah we're just gonna shoot this and see if it goes flying off the [ __ ] end of the gun uh because this is a full ass rifle round see what happens the kyle forgive me [Applause] okay so while that is still a suppressor this is also still five five six uh super sonic ammo so it's still breaking the sound barrier nothing you could really do about that so i'm gonna put some [ __ ] ears on because i already sleep with the [ __ ] fan on and honestly at my age tonight it doesn't really need to get any worse if it doesn't have too [Applause] all right so this is the real test full mag 556. honestly it's still it's not bad you could legit hold on to it i'm not gonna lie a little impressed so there's one last thing that i'm sure you guys have been thinking and i've kind of been thinking it too it's like all right plastic can it works it doesn't shoot off the end of the gun it doesn't melt how is it to drop resistance or just generally getting the [ __ ] kicked out of it because let's face it you're going to be waiting in nfa jail for a long time pay your 200 tax stamp you don't want your [ __ ] can to break so um i've already asked permission to be beat this up i'm definitely gonna [ __ ] take it so you know like let's let's just say like you're at the range whatever and your rifle falls over yeah all right for plastic really not bad all right it's time to see if the mute passes the vibe check i actually gave that a pretty good little thumb loosen the can up a little bit but [ __ ] [ __ ] howdy so at this point i'm just being an [ __ ] i kind of wanted to see how much this can could actually deal with uh so i ran it over the truck i don't know why you would ever do that but i i did so we're here now i finished running this over and uh just gonna rip it up and see what happens plus i got to run over an ar-15 so uh well here goes nothing see if we make a plastic rocket today nothing holy [ __ ] i saw you guys back there like yes so closing thoughts i didn't expect a whole lot from this my expectations are pretty low because you know it's not it's so it's a 3d printed plastic but it's not normal plastic and it's not a normal 3d printer it's a very very expensive machine it's not something it's not a hobbyist printer right this is this is kind of more space grade kind of [ __ ] but still in my head it's like i didn't expect it to explode but i sure should didn't expect it to run like that and i definitely didn't expect it to basically not heat up and melt it after a few meg dumps so overall i'm kind of excited you know new kids on the block but i'm curious to see what kind of stuff they can do with this if this is their prototype um i'm interested i'm in so hopefully this is interesting for you guys uh i don't know what your your predictions were but uh hopefully you were as surprised as i was but anyways guys i appreciate it if you'd like to see more cool stuff like this let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to check out any new companies whatever let me know down in the comments i kind of want to [ __ ] run one of these on an ak it doesn't feel right did not have one in the video but maybe we'll fix that anyways guys i appreciate you and i will see you sexy youtube mother lovers in the next video going home with this [Music] with that [ __ ] wind wait for a hole for wind here goes nothing see if we make a plastic rocket today it would help if i chamber the [ __ ] gun don't you think", "BLuqtTn4610":

what's new on the layout we'll start right here at the railway east end of banff yard so i kept going with the tree making over the past month and i've been planting a few down here so this row this whole row behind the ice shed here is all new i still need to make some kind of mid size and small side size ones because i think it's just too uniform right now it looks like a row of trees and it just doesn't really look real to my eye so i'm going to try and get some smaller ones made some medium-sized ones and kind of feather that that tree line a bit so that it doesn't look so harsh when you step back it looks pretty good though so this is about five feet away you can see it's actually a nice scene you got mount rundle in the background there that's a famous mountain the backdrop of banff and it's actually kind of hard to notice that you know there's a couple here that i've just been experimenting with trying to see how i can blend them in so there's like three trees there and then it's just uh that's just a photo backdrop and then there's some more trees on this side that you can see but when viewed as a hole they blend in pretty good and it actually gives some depth and and make some light disappear as well and this is just what it looks like if you're looking down from the other end of the yard so still lots of work to do there tree making continues current tree count right now is at 410 410 trees built so far so one thing that's new down here that's layout related but not necessarily a train i had an uncle who's a carpenter cabinet maker made me this coat rack for the layout and it's just a beautiful piece of work so the uh the rail bed is aspen or poplar the track ties are walnut it's got real railroad spikes they machine these special fittings here these steel fittings to support lag bolts so this thing is like rock solid you get no concerns with anything ever pulling it down it's even got the uh squashed penny here they squashed a penny with a hammer and it's epoxied right into the rail bed there so that's really cool man he's a talented woodworker for sure so i can't wait to get a spot for this i'm gonna put it right near the bottom of the staircase where you kind of first come down to the layout so if you're visiting you can take your coat off and hang it on a real railroad spike i'll just show the cross section there the rails are aluminum they're pretty cool so the other thing that's new on the layout is i received these in the mail this week and these are atrial scale concrete lego bricks or or jersey barriers they're called some places these came all the way from the united kingdom and i want to have a special shout out to ian roberts for sending these his son and him 3d printies he did up the design for uh i think it's a resin based 3d printer and these are really cool so he's he noticed that i didn't have uh any of these concrete lego blocks on my layout and in the real thing in banff there's there's a whole bunch of these and they use them for blocking off traffic for where the tour buses park and stuff like that so thanks a lot ian and you'll have to check out his youtube channel he's into a lot of the same stuff as me mountain railroading in western canada or denver colorado type deal it centers around the town of fairview so i'll include a link to his channel in the video description and thank you very much ian for sending these along i can't wait to put these on the layout so that's it for new stuff on the layout but over here my workbench i've actually been really busy this past month and this is what took up most of my time so i managed to track down a couple sets of the elusive nj international crossing gates these things are super hard to find right now they must be having some production issues in china or wherever these these are made but so i got two sets basically to chop up and create the automated crossing gates at bamf so i got an 1160 which is the red and white arm crossing gates also i'll show some pictures kind of the whole process maybe a montage of the whole process but the red and the white crossing gate is kind of like that one and these arms were mounted on like this but it was only one direction with um lights so i i really had to uh drop these up and i pretty much redid them there there's not much that's original this one is sort of original because it has lights facing the same way as the crossbuck but i added the light the second set of lights that face this way and the other one that i used is the 1165 which is the black and white gate and i actually i'm going to use reuse the gates off that one i'm not going to use the red and white gates and what i did was working off prototype pictures banff always had this really kind of unique or at least unique to the wagon sub or stuff in western canada here but it had an individual standalone light like this guy here with two sets on it because this light faces the road that comes out of the yard on the bamf yard and then on this pedestal just behind it is the where the gate arm is and this is how it was for a long time and it's still like that except now it's got the modern post so in the area that i model you know 2009 to kind of 2019 rough this is the crossing that i like the best the arrangement of it so the other one on the far side of the road was a pedestal style like this but with the dual lights on both sides and there's just no way that anything close that nj makes could replicate this so i pretty much chopped them down the the black and white one is almost completely gone except i reused three of the four sets of lights so you can see here i still have one set of lights so this is how they come stock from nj like a tower style led goes in through the back of the housing and then they double that as the lens but i kind of take issue with that because to me that doesn't really look super real you know it's kind of a giveaway that it's a model having it like that so what i did was and i tested on this one actually first was i took my dremel i've got a flat kind of dremel router fitting on it and i just ground that lens right down to try and make it more realistic and i tested it and it looked okay when it was lit up it doesn't throw the light as perfectly as it does when it has a dome on it but i think it looks a lot better when it's not lit and a lot of the times when you're looking at them that's the way you look at them so i did after i tested one there and i knew i could do it i did it on the rest of these lights so four over there ten in total they're all ground down like that i got rid of the post that this one was on and i used one of my i think it's 1 16 brass tubing from my signal kits from showcase miniatures and i redid the post this is the base from a showcase miniature searchlight signal i just thought it looked better than the one that came with nj the nj1 looks like this and i just thought this this one had a little more fine scale detail on it obviously i added the third set of lights on the top of this guy i also um squished them down and got them closer together because they're quite far apart um on the stock nj ones i sanded down the cross buck and got it a little closer to scale size it's still a little bit too big and thick but it's a lot better looking to the eye in my opinion and of course i put the canadian style cross buck on there and then i added the bell off of it actually came off of this one over here and so i added that bell to the top of that just based on prototype pictures that i had of these crossings and the the two track crossing sign it's mounted using one of the showcase miniatures searchlight signals plaques and then it's a sign i created the the sign for that and the other guy over here kind of the same deal added the second light here on the back side and that was from the other one that i just robbed off it got the two tracks there canadian crossbook and then a cap from the uh searchlight signal kits so this one will end up getting the gate arm on it and they still have the linkages and this guy here the little pedestal which is i basically just cut the other guy that came with this i chopped it off and just made that just a standalone pedestal so a lot of kit bashing to kind of get these to where they're at right now and i have my own i don't know if i've shown it before but i made a bunch of um canadian signage and cp signage specifically for my layout so i used my i got cross bucks anywhere up from two to four tracks to five tracks actually i've got on there so that's what i use um they're just printed on printer paper and it's kind of a steel gray color on the back side so i will put some pictures because this was a lot of work getting them to this point [Music] um i rewired everything with magnet wire the the ones that come with nj international like this is the wiring they use and they just twist it up and paint it silver and then it's just like behind the the post and that's how they wire to both so i rewire them with magnet wire it's a lot a lot harder to see like it's pretty hard to make out but there's there's two magnet wires on the back side of that post that's the new wiring for me and these things are actually a lot harder to work with than i thought they would be like i i assume they would be like pewter or something they're actually cast brass so you can see there so this is from one of the ones that i chopped up but they are extremely hard to uh to work with if you're i'd use the dremel with the metal cut off wheel to do any kind of cutting on them drilling them was really difficult like i had to redrill these lights because they're cast brass they're actually the whole thing they must cast it all in one piece as you can see here the cat the the cross buck and everything is all one piece so i had to use my dremel and cut it off on both sides and then re-drill that crossback out to get that back on there so this was a lot of work to me the crossbucks are like such a an eye catcher especially since they light up and you know move there's movement so they really draw attention on the layout so i figured might as well try going all out on these things try and get them as close as i can to the cp prototype and bamf and i think it's going to pay off i can't wait to get these things hooked up to my logic rail technologies crossing circuits and get these things automated so these are all done and painted and ready to go the final thing i'm working on right now is the crossing gates i debated doing this but then i just thought you know what i'm gonna go all out on these things so these are the black and white gates they come with some tiny brass lights kind of three of them put on there to represent the flashing lights you'd see on the gate arms so i ground those right down and i've got tri-color smds on here and i've wired them up just for the red and we're gonna have flashing crossing lights on the automated gates just like the real thing so i still got a ways to go on there i've laid down the white on them they're all wired up and working all i've got all six on there so the final thing i'm going to do is paint the red 45 sashing on the on the gate arm so they're almost there and pretty soon i'm going to have these done too and then when that's all finished they'll be going on the layout and be wiring them up with the logic rail technologies crossing circuits can't show them lit right now because they're masked and i'm not going to unmask them to light them but next month should have them all done and be able to show you guys that at least so that's going to wrap up this layout update video guys as always thanks a lot for watching and we'll see you next time",

the walls again okay nice little yellow color i like it okay it looks nice now let's go let's go looking good we're really leveling up our services adam let's go yeah okay we're only on day five yo hey again this is an ad i'm sorry we can't i wish they would let you buy the nail colors with money i mean that would make sense right yeah but you just you literally can't you have to just upgrade your furniture how about instead of spending all of our money on furniture how about we spend it on colors because that's you know that makes more sense agreed yeah the game the game won't let you it literally will not let you okay i need green to do this i don't have green you're going to get red red flowers okay i'm sorry you got to deal with it i'm sorry i'm sorry that still looks cool though it still looks cool don't be too angry she does not look happy bro oh no she looks like anna's mom and we don't do chores bro she's not happy yeah okay you're right okay this still looks nice all right please still give us money all right all right i'll take it i'll take it i'll take it cool there's a lot of people with green hair that come to this salon yeah it's a very trendy salon it must be all right they want a square which we do not have because you must watch an ad for that so i'm gonna give them the simple and they're very angry and yelling at us it's not my fault we're trying our best that makes no sense they should let you spend coins to like buy new supplies yeah i agree that would make a lot more sense other than just like buying furniture because like what's the point if you have nice furniture but you can't give the customer what they want it doesn't matter how nice the sofa is yeah oh we go wait how do we get full score there even though we didn't give them what

tarts me", "EdBR3HLdNrs": "hey all scott here it's truly an awful situation when you re-experience something you initially loved but upon further inspection it's just not as good as you remember it being i'm of course talking about eczema tried it again wasn't into it anyways i'm gonna replay mario 3d land 3d mario a staple of 3d mario games the 3d mario lineage is an important one every single game stands on its own as a monumental moment in gaming history each one bringing with it innovations and design control playstyle and just gaming in general a new 3d mario game was is and forever will be an event they don't happen all the time but when they do they scared the [ __ ] out of me they don't happen all the time this isn't normal each 3d mario is unique and special in their own way and most people take playing through each and every one as a sign of being human but every family has a daughter you don't dislike super mario 3d land for the nintendo 3ds yes this is one of the best nintendo 3ds games ever made it saved the system from performing slightly below expectations it successfully transitioned 3d mario into 3d mario it uses the y button how come people don't talk about it whenever 3d mario comes up 3d land is very very rarely thrown into the combo was there a statewide ban or am i just talking to the wrong people because the sunoco cashier had nothing to say about this well that nintendo 3ds was something special wasn't it basically a ds with a fancy new areola and a 3d screen that doesn't need glasses sure i'll bite what kind of games are on it you sure you don't want to talk about the headphone jack yeah the 3ds was struggling throughout its first year on the market with a lack of heavy-hitting titles we got ocarina of time 3d star fox 64 3d and games like pilot wings resort and steel diver but these were remakes or such my new titles that nobody really had much of a reason to blow 250 bones on three terrible cameras there was pretty much nothing too awful worthwhile to play on the handheld for that first year that didn't mean it didn't have promise we knew about so many big games coming in the future buying a 3ds in 2011 was more of an investment if anything icarus animal crossing resident evil paper mario mario kart metal gear kingdom hearts smash brothers you may have had to play pokemon rumble blast but considering what was coming it was worth it maybe especially since we were getting a brand new 3d mario game for the portable now this was big news this was 2011 we were hot off the heels of super mario galaxy 2 releasing in 2010. that was considered a good video game so when they were making another video game i think we had every right to believe it would be good but of course what made this special was the fact it was a 3d mario game in your hands now 2d mario's have been a constant on the nintendo handhelds but back in november 2010 shigeru miyamoto confirmed that they were not only developing a new 2d mario for the 3ds but a 3d one as well to be fair super mario 64 ds holds the record for first portable 3d mario game but it was a remake of super mario 64 so formally revealed on march 2nd 2011 at the game developers conference super mario for nintendo 3ds looked exactly how you'd expect it to i mean hearing that they're making a new 3d mario game and seeing these screenshots it is one it looks like a mixture of the more typical theming of super mario 64 with the streamlined yet out there level design of super mario galaxy 2. i loved quality but where's the tail you may notice something that looks like a tail at the bottom on the logo oh i'm not pissed 2011 was right when many game developers are starting to actually react to the retro boom internet was always going on and on about how the world was better in 1990 remember how super mario bros 3 came out loads of retro game discussions consisted of how super mario bros 3 on the nes was the best mario game of all time and one of the core reasons often given was the awesome power-ups and the big one at display here was raccoon mario being able to whack enemies with your tail and glide and fly yeah you were a raccoon of course you could do that obviously loads of nostalgia and love for super mario brothers 3 existed and still exist so nintendo decided to capitalize on that by injecting a bit of mario 3 into mario 3d i mean this was awesome just the idea of being able to fly like he could in that old game made this one infinitely more interesting because as it stood there wasn't a ton to get excited about outside of it being a new 3d marion handheld so when e3 2011 came around nintendo had a ton of oddly shaped screens at their press conference that they finally decided to put some use to they had these cgi animations representing the major nintendo 3ds games they were about to go into detail about and one of them was for mario 3d yes mario comes in jumps around and gets a power up i never cared for mario but i'm liking the new direction this power-up ended up being the tanuki suit yay so not necessarily raccoon mario from mario 3 rather tanooki mario from mario 3. it was the exact same power-up except it was more suit than severed raccoon ears and you could turn into a statue so not much is lost here it's basically the same power up we then dive into the first trailer for super mario 3d as it was called at the time and there he is tanooki mario he can whip his tail and hover oh where's the flying so you bring back tanooki mario for mario 3 to end up just leaving out the entire point of tanooki mario for mario 3. then nintendo just think we like this part because it was cute it's [ __ ] adorable but that's besides the point it's really weird they make this whole game's identity surround a classic power-up returning when it can't even do the thing it was famous for doing other than the power up mario 3d looked fantastic for a 3ds game if you held it far away and squinted it could probably be mistaken for mario galaxy and the gameplay was interesting here they were bringing in loads of elements from the 2d mario games and incorporating them in a 3d mario for the first time ever ending the level with a flagpole when you get hit you shrink down to small mario the way power-ups work the stage timer this was a very uniquely unique mario there was stuff to discuss but this trailer was far from great i mean they forgot to hold the run button in most of the footage so this game looked slow and pretty much everything here we've seen mario do before a few months later the game's final title was revealed and i don't know why they couldn't think of this sooner i think they were panicking on what to call this thing super mario 3d lane could be the title of any 3d mario game ever released this game's sequel super mario 3d world could have been called super mario 3d land and this one super mario 3d world and these titles are so close to super mario land and super mario world that i constantly hear people mess up these games titles super mario land 3d super mario world 3d some people have just called this super mario land and super mario world but on top of that some people have called this super mario land in this super mario world well after a few more trailers some with really odd amounts of popping super mario 3d land released on november 13th 2011 here in north america to critical acclaim and peter's fist peta is the organization to listen to they love animals so much they would kill one to proof how serious they are they saw nintendo was releasing a new mario game featuring an animal suit as a power-up and decided to go for the angle of this they even made an online flash game about it all well now i gotta listen to them obviously this was done as a way to get attention if you were somebody going online to discuss how absolutely ridiculous it is that peta thinks nintendo's promoting animal abuse congratulations you did exactly what peta wanted you to do in mario 3 out of froxy did anybody really think nintendo was pressuring kids to think anything of that here's a gun kill a frog super mario 3d land was lauded as the killer app the 3ds needed it actually used the glasses-free 3d effectively with many saying it completely justified the gimmick so planning that it is in fact not just a gimmick and can be used to enhance gameplay because of that and a very necessary price drop earlier in the year this alongside the release of mario kart 7 kicked the 3ds in gear and ever since it experienced a pretty sizable amount of success sure it wasn't a runaway hit like the original nintendo ds or wii but it did more than well enough to carry nintendo throughout that generation mario 3d land helped nintendo sell a handheld that was truly its only hope during that era the wii was dying the wii u was about to release so the wii u was dying the nintendo 3ds was nintendo's success story at the time and without super mario 3d land it might have been a different story so why does nobody give a [ __ ] about this game anymore super mario 3d land is the odd one out in the 3d mario lineage it's not a bad game but most of the time people talk about 64 sunshine galaxy 1 and 2 and then immediately jump over to 3d world or sometimes odyssey many feel that with 3d land's successor there's not much reason to go back to it as 3d world is just better in most ways if you played 3d world you sort of already kind of played 3d land i mean these are two separate games though there's very little distinctive about this one other than it being five inches i picked this one up after knitting some christmas money in late 2011. i played through it and loved every second and then i played it again and then again this time 100 completing the game with no deaths and when i say no deaths i mean every time i was about to die i quit out of the game and re-entered until i beat it first try look at that no deaths i did that all right let's try out super mario 3d land again never thought this would be the intro super mario 3d land starts out simple enough just a small gameplay demo but after a while we enter the screen where we can control mario and understand what makes the game tick now of course if you're not seeing this on a 3ds screen itself with the 3d turn on you're missing out buddy see cranking that 3d slider up we get a sense of depth objects in the foreground are now obviously in the foreground things in the background yep they're definitely back there this demo screen features an optical illusion where in 2d mode you have more questions than answers in 3d mode you have more answers than questions moving in a specific location shows how the illusion works if you're only playing in 2d which many of us definitely did with the 3d effect being really picky you've had to hold it in just the right spot to get the effect to work properly and a couple 3ds models excluding the 3d feature entirely mario 3d land still works perfectly fine in 2d but you always have that faint feeling you're missing something starting up a new file super mario 3d land has a tree and a lot of it i guess this is giving story context as to why there are not tanooki leaves all over the place because that was my biggest concern when this game was announced how was that bowser's doing it was a rainy night it's like if i saw a fire oh i know this exact arsonist i can tell by his signature flames but breaking news that isn't the only problem on the block bowser took peach and leaves at least he left a note that scared mario so much he went to a world map i love this little detail of mario anxiously running in place it only happens here in the beginning and that's why i like it popping into world 1-1 [Music] i'm shocked so it's mario do you need mario to be exact imagine a new super mario brothers game where you can move in a 3d space 3d mario games up to this point were pretty different from 2d marios in terms of the core design you'd have multiple missions within a single level some games were more linear than others with specific ends to the levels whereas some were more open-ended and about exploration 3d land is as linear as linear could be you have a start to the level get to the end of the level there are no branching paths or once they do exploration wide it's all about getting over this that's not a bad thing in fact this does wonders for covering up that giant gash between 2d mario and 3d mario these two things were pretty different but 3d land as if a 2d mario was a 3d mario most of the controls are just like they are in the 2d games but we do have some extra moves from 3d ones like the long jump but overall 3d land in my opinion has far more in common with 2d mario than with 3d mario again not a bad thing but it just makes it sort of underwhelming like yup it's 2d mario in 3d they did it they did it well good for them it's pretty cool considering this is what super mario 64 was originally envisioned as tons of levels just like the 2d mario games a flagpole at the end but it had to be reworked due to hardware limitations so we got multiple missions to do in fewer larger levels in this way 3d land is like the game god never wanted us to see but this time we've got stereoscopic 3d without the need for glasses i should have never gotten prescription lenses this entire game was designed around the 3d how the camera angles are fixed the perspective of it all the controls everything was crafted to make it so the game was enhanced by the 3d effect now jumping feels more precise you know exactly where you're landing with that slider up it's never 100 necessary but i do feel playing the game in 2d i miss my jumps a tad more than in 3d you can also change whether or not the 3d pops out or sinks in by hitting up or down on the d-pad on 3d is way more pizzazzy when it's popping out when it sinks and i feel like i'm looking at a goldfish so well yes i agree the 3d does enhance the gameplay it doesn't enhance it nearly as much as impressions back in 2011 made me believe the way people were talking about this game sounded like every game from this point forward will have to be in glasses-free 3d super mario 3d land has started a revolution like no this is one of the few 3ds games that truly benefits from leaving that slider on in most games it's a nice effect but not much more than that in 3d land it's a nice effect that slightly benefits the player by turning it on but not much more than that these 3d illusion rooms appear every now and then same idea as that demo screen these are kind of cool i guess they do the best job of immediately showcasing how 3d is beneficial but i feel like these were designed in a way where they wanted to push a gimmick by creating a problem that wouldn't be there normally and that problem is solved by said gimmick like oh you don't know where these coins are and perspective to you crank that 3d slider up see like no nobody thought oh my god they finally solved the coin problem the rest of the game these perspective issues aren't an issue the 3d is sort of cool here but it's a total and utter gimmick it's like in star fox zero where you use the wii u gamepad to aim you have to look between the gamepad and the tv screen and it's difficult to get used to but people who did get used to it liked it a lot they were like aiming works really well this way it also worked perfectly in star fox 64. they just created a problem with star fox zero to then solve it with their gimmick and they didn't even solve it oh the 3d works pretty well in mario 3d land it's just not that necessary it does benefit you to leave it on but i've played most of the game in 2d no problem maybe i've missed a few jumps here and there but i can always shrug it off but that was the big thing everybody lotted about this game the implementation of 3d what else does it have going for it existence this is one of the most basic mario experiences you could ask for at least with the new super mario brothers games i mean a basic mario experience is what i expect the title new super mario brothers basically says that but this is a 3d mario game to be fair the title of super mario 3d land kinda says basic mario experience as well however when i lay on all the 3d marios this one has the least original about it no doubt eight worlds you go through each level collect three star medals placed in each if you want you need a certain amount to progress through the game beat the boss at the end of the world get a cute cutscene where mario gets a letter showing the status of peach rinse and repeat the level designs are good but completely unmemorable there isn't a single one where i get excited to replay it maybe the clock one but that's it pretty much each of these levels has a theme we've seen done to death by mario before oh [ __ ] grass snow colors now at the very least each world doesn't have a theme where every level in world one is grass themed every level in world 2 is desert themed no the themes are completely random and i kind of like that variety is fun it keeps things fresh and again the levels are well designed they work great they look wonderful on the 3ds the entire game oozes quality like this looks lovely but it's all stuff we've seen before and the stages are really short and really really easy there's an infinite one-up trick you can find in the second level there's nothing wrong with easy games but mario 3d land is so easy that it almost feels mindless the levels just aren't too interesting from a design perspective there's not really any where i get excited to play it i'm just like oh sweet more for my thumb to do even the music has mostly just reused a remix from previous games the main power up at play here is just taken from mario 3 and you can't even fly sure flying in these stages wouldn't work so why bring back this power up why not create a brand new one you can't even turn into a statue in its basic form now you can find a variant where you do turn into a statue by performing a ground pound thanks the boomerang flower appears as a new power-up and it's just a worse version of the fire flower thanks if you die a lot you get the invincibility leaf it's the tanooki soup but you're invincible thanks and then if you die a lot a lot you get the p wing where it just completes the level for you great feature there is the propeller box which isn't technically a power up more of a box you can wear it's pretty much the propeller suit from new super mario brothers we moving on i mean i always just want the tanooki suit 100 it's the best power-up in this game but again you bring back this power-up to just gutted of what made it great in the first place at least there are a decent amount of new enemies like tail bowser that's his name many enemies now have tanuki tales again i think nintendo got the wrong idea as to what we liked about the tanooki suit i loved quality but where's the tail i've matured since and then i was throwing this tail on so many things in the mario universe around this time they know well people love the tukey suit for the tail but we do get these guys this guy those guys there's some fun new designs in here but they also put a tail on a block that's a new enemy look at this list of characters pump the brakes they're in these cutouts of enemies that are supposed to trick you it's an illusion where you can tell what's a real enemy and what's a fake enemy if you have the 3d on and i never missed a cut out of an enemy for a real enemy i i don't know who they were fooling here we have toad houses to visit every now and then where they give us some power-ups honestly what i like about these is the camera angle when entering the house this feels like a regular 3d mario game and this whole thing just feels cool to run around it reminds me of the camera angles from the original screenshots at gdc like these make the game look way more involved than it turned out to be the fixed camera angle works really well here but makes the game feel so sterile like yup this is all there is to see there are these mystery rooms you can enter on the world map or in a level itself where you get this tiny challenge you have to complete under a time limit fine like most of these challenges are crazy easy so they're not the most engaging in the world boss fights they brought back boom boom for mario 3 alongside his brand new female counterpart pompom but they're the only bosses besides bowser so you re-fight these guys a couple times alongside refining bowser a couple times at least the final bowser fight is pretty neat it's this giant crumbling landscape and he throws barrels like donkey kong this is regular bowser we're talking here not tail bowser and when those credits finally roll after three hours of playing from start to finish jesus christ this was a short and easy game it's time to reflect on what i just played it was okay but then something magical happens the game doubles in length we get eight special worlds i i think that's just awesome many mario games only give you a couple of these but my 3d line effectively gives you two times the stages that's so cool this is where we get the statue leaf the poison mushroom makes an appearance every now and then these are remixed stages levels from the regular eight worlds revamped to be a bit harder some of them are pretty lazy they just kind of barf cosmic clones in them where they mimic your every move and touching them hurts you but hey you unlock luigi as a playable character after beating the first special world he doesn't turn into tanooki luigi he turns into kitsune luigi because luigi can't be a tanooki are you [ __ ] serious and then beating every stage as mario and luigi collecting every star medal and getting to the top of every flagpole unlocks one of final brutally difficult tough as nails level i beat it in one try see super mario 3d lands ideal of brutally difficult is on par with the cnc oh that is super mario 3d land or as many others call it mario land super 3d i know i just dogged on this game but i loved this thing i replayed it constantly it was always sort of my safe bet game if i didn't know what to play but i knew for a fact i wouldn't be starting max payne 3 i would just replay martha 3d land again this is a good game but critically looking at it right now it's really basic i feel like i've become less accepting of the status quo for a mario game which this is very much that it for sure gave a massive push to the 3ds not only showing how 3d can enhance a game but also using the gyroscope i saved the 3ds mario 3d land was kind of my junk food game there wasn't a ton of substance but it was a great time killer the stages being so quick and easy made them perfect for a handheld and while the game itself doesn't have a lot of personality to truly make it stick out compared to the other 3d marios what it did well it did well so i think that answers the question why isn't this talked about as much there's not much to say about it it's a new super mario brothers game in 3d it honestly makes more sense to talk about 3d land alongside new super mario bros than super mario sunshine oh my god i said something wild didn't i i should shield my eyes from

A broken one. I came up with an idea at first glance so I brought my suitcase without exception. (sexy butt) Nowadays, when I see a broken wall I feel like I'm ready to make CLICKBAIT VIDEOS ...I mean, awesome structures Before we start, let's Chika Chika (sound of brushing teeth & it's a word for kids in Korean) I recommend you to take good care of your teeth ...unless you want a 3D pen implant. Today, I'm gonna make a miniature bungee stand. Insert a metal ruler on the wall to support Then fasten it with filament. and cover the ruler with filament. It's hard to see from the side but I'm making a flat surface. fill them again, but horizontally this time The surface was a bit taller than my height so I decided to move up. ...without realizing, I was on the top. I felt like a gargoiyle guarding the entrance of a dungeon and I'm protecting the entrance of a apartment... You shouldn't. I have to hurry since this is very dangerous. To make it stick to the wall, I made a cradle on top. Draw a line to the end of the stand like a falling bitcoin graph headlong until it reaches the bottom. I repeated it two to three more times to make it harder. Make pillars vertically. I've never tried a bungee jump. What about you? In fact, I'm not interested. ...I just asked cause I had nothing to say. If the structure is quite done, Pull out the ruler. And make another cradle on the bottom too. Finish it by adding a roof at the end. In fact, I already made a bungee jumping guy yesterday. Add details with a tiny brush. Make him a scaring Adidas fanboy. Now it's time to attach them. Make bungee rope with filament and attach the bungee jumping guy.

"tO5Ym6-H2Ac": "if you're looking for something useful to 3d print here's some fantastic workshop tools from the community if the 3d printing bug has been new hard particularly modifying them there's a fair chance that most of the 3d prints you do are 3d printing parts for your 3d printer there are some great tools for this like this v-roller bearing extractor by lewis teams let's say you've got a flat spot on one of your wheels this tool offers an easy way to separate the wheel from the bearing so you can get your machine moving smoothly i happen to think that's a really good tool but it's not going to impress your maker buddies who aren't into 3d printing and think it's only for making novelty parts in this video we're going to fix that by making a bunch of great tools to use in your workshop all of these are from members of the community who have generously provided them for free on thingiverse so let's celebrate their work and upgrade our toolset we'll cover printing assembly and use as necessary so you can follow along at home we're gonna do this in categories and the first one is tools to find the center of things the first one is by mobilo and it's a center finder for straight pieces of material what you're seeing here is the printed pieces of the fdm version the general arrangement is as you can see here and like a lot of the tools in this video if you have any undersized holes it's good to open them up with the correct drill bit do check the instructions however because some holes are precisely the right size for an m3 bolt to cut its own thread as you insert it i opted to start by attaching the center section to the two small arms and then mounting that on top of the main legs before using another four m3 bolts to put the whole thing together the holes in the center piece are for putting a pencil pen or scribe through which means that if they're undersized it's worth opening up once again with the appropriately sized drill bit here's how it works traditionally if we wanted to draw a line down the center of a piece of material we would need to measure across the width in at least two places divide and then draw a line between the two but with this tool all we need to do is put it over the top swivel the arms to make it close on both sides and then run it along the length with a pencil or a scribe in the middle this should give us a line perfectly down the middle of our piece of stock it works just the same on other materials and we can use it on metal for instance with the largest hole being the right size for a sharpie our next center finder is from marius hornberger and i've showed this on the past but it's worth revisiting no assembly required and operation as follows let's say we want to find the exact center point of this round object so we can drill a hole we simply place the center finder hard against one side mark a line using the cutout trench in the middle rotate the tool to a new position and repeat with another line if you're feeling pedantic you can also do a third line and if that matches it should verify that your object is round that should leave you the exact center ready to drill to perfection there's plenty of these round center finders to choose from but this one also has the advantage of working on square stock we put the tool against one corner again draw a line through the center trench position on another corner draw a second line and when we remove the tool the two lines should overlap directly in the center this centre finder for a drill by de gent is something i didn't know i needed but now i'm glad i have there's only two pieces and we need a single m4 bolt to join them as we insert it it's going to cut its own thread and we need to adjust how tight we do it to make sure that there's no wobble but it can also rotate freely and this is what it's for let's say we need to drill a hole through this round pipe and we need it exactly in the middle but lining that up is awfully hard we remove our drill bit and insert the printed tool into the chuck finger tight is fine as you can see as we position the pipe underneath the dial will point to the middle when it's exactly in the center now is a good time to use some sort of fast clamp to hold the vice in place remove the tool reinsert the drill bit and then drill our hole in the perfect position this plastic pipe is pretty forgiving but on narrow metal tube it's going to stop the drill bit from shooting off to the side i think we're off to a good start so let's continue with some measurement tools this screw measuring device by cmh i've also covered in the past but absolutely deserves its place in this video i chose to print it in white and then simply use a sharpie to make the printed labels legible this simple tool makes sorting and storing loose fasteners very quick and easy we can check both the diameter and the length in just a few seconds with this design catering from m2 up to m5 with a maximum length of 50 millimeters i found this handy printed tool is in constant demand because it helps me keep my spare fasteners organized next up is this fillet gauge by tna tmr and once again this is deceptively simple but useful this is another tool i opted to print in one color and then use a sharpie to highlight the labels and this is what it's for let's say we need to measure something accurately for the purposes of a cut drawing calipers will allow us to measure most exterior dimensions with a minimum of fuss but what about these tricky exterior fillets you can kind of eyeball them but the result isn't really going to be accurate and here's where our fillet gauge comes in we simply try the different sizes until we find one that matches in this case this exterior fillet is five millimeters and this larger one on the other side is eight millimeters this means that the cad model that we're basing these measurements on is going to be quite accurate the tool can also do internal fillets but only for five and three millimeters on each end we can see here three millimeters does not fit but if i rotate the tool i have a nice match for five millimeters for this fillet let's measure some angles with this printed tool by dell 1979 and this one is kind of like a fancier sliding bevel you need to print two long arms two short arms and four of the tightening knobs the knobs have a hex cutout where you're meant to put the head of an m4 bolt but the only ones i had had this square washer permanently attached however i found that i could still use a normal hex head bolt because it had a fairly tight interference fit on the sides and just to be safe i used a little super glue around the edges to hold it in place assembly is the same for each of the four junctions with the side that was facing down towards the bed facing up we push through the tightening knob and bolt then we flip the whole assembly over get an m4 nut rest it in the trench on the underside and turn the knob to engage the thread repeat four times and the tool is assembled you should be able to loosen any of the knobs to free up the assembly move it into position and then tighten the knobs to lock it in place the simplest way to use this tool is to move it to match the outside shapes of an angled object you can then lock the angle in place move to another material and then trace the exact angle what i found is a better use is to use it to trace really hard to reach and complicated objects like the angle on this front winch bar that angle can be then measured by using a protractor and then you can base your cad design around this angle to ensure that your part has a perfect fit one more for measuring and it's this lockable contour gauge by tjalf there's a variety of sizes available to print on thingiverse and you're seeing the parts here for the default smallest size we want these blue sections to slide nicely against each other so i lowered my solid in-fill flow rate you can see little gaps there and that kept the top surface quite smooth for the size i'm showing you'll need 41 of these in total we start assembly by inserting a captive m3 nut and then we lay all of the little fingers in one half of the case making sure that they're all facing the same direction you'll probably need to squeeze the existing ones into place to slide the last one in as it's quite tight but this is normal and once they're in place we can put on the other half of the case and use some m4 bolts cutting their own thread to attach the two halves together we then have a printed spring that pushes in from the end we insert our fifth bolt line it up with the locking finger and then screw that down before the case bolts can be tightened for good i found one was a little stiff at first but running it back and forth took off the high spots and gave me smoother operation so what do we do with it i don't have an actual scenario that i need it for right now so here's a simulated one let's say i'm cutting a piece of flooring and it needs to match this complicated contour i position the tool in the corner and then carefully push the fingers forward so they match the contour of the object i'm trying to trace once i've got them all accurately in position i can apply a little bit of tension with the locking arm to hold my contour in place you can then trace your contour to your other material and after cutting you should hopefully find that it matches the contour of what you measured quite accurately our next category is sanding and painting regulars to this channel know that i hate sanding so i'll be quick on this section but hopefully there's something of use for you first up we have this mini sanding block by just ignorant it's more effective than holding sandpaper by hand and definitely more ergonomic i printed this one overnight and the cold temperatures meant it lifted and warped a little but that doesn't affect its operation we're going to place two m3 screws in from the bottom and then we're going to hammer in two m3 nuts into the tightening knobs our clamping piece then slides over the top and we secure the two knobs just loosely for now finally on the underside we have two caps to cover the tops of the screws to use we cut some sandpaper one and a half inches wide and if you're like me you're going to struggle to slide it in from the side but eventually i did endure and managed to get it in place before doing up the two locking knobs i don't have anything that needs sanding right now so forgive this poor example but this is a great tool for ensuring your sanding surface is flat and for keeping your fingers clean and out of harm's way and as a bonus you can always angle the tool forwards or back to use the rounded edges as appropriate let's switch our attention to painting with these serious paint cones by jmax because these are tiny they're a great way to use up the remains of filament on a near-empty spool i don't need to but let's pretend i want to paint this flat tray if i paint it flat on the cardboard the paint wrists running over the edge and gluing it down to the cardboard ruining the paint and making my life harder so these paint cones come in handy for propping up object off your flat surface which lets you paint safely down to the edge without any risk of the object getting stuck what makes this design extra handy are the holes in the bottom so you can screw them onto your sacrificial painting surface this means that they'll no longer slide around and that means when you transport the object that you're painting from your work area to your painting area you don't have to worry about it falling off and getting dirty especially when it has wet paint let's get back on track with some tools for striking and cutting first up is the thwack from mr megatronic and i learned about this print from my patrons it's basically a plastic handsome hammer it seemed like it needed support material so i opted for this remix by low 351 which due to the way the layers are stacked is going to be slightly weaker but that shouldn't matter because this hammer is for delicate jobs the instructions call for 100 infill so when your hand it feels quite weighty and solid i also think it's quite handsome as promised why do we need a plastic hammer well sometimes we need quite a soft touch like installing this diffuser onto this led torch the thwack is the right tool here because it won't break anything underneath and it won't mark the surface you can buy plastic hammers from their hardware store so why not print one instead next up this tube cutter by predator junior and i reckon this is a really clever design this is the only print in this video that i needed to apply support for so i manually placed it in simplified 3d i think however i was a bit overzealous because after it was printed i remembered that i had to remove all of this support it took me about 10 minutes to snap it free without any damage to the model which meant i was ready for assembly the blades this tube cutter uses are the ones found as spares in the handle of your box cutter i found that the notch on the printed part matched the blade exactly so once the blade was in place i got the second retaining piece and clamped the whole lot together with two m4 bolts which cut their own thread as they went in for me there's two areas that make this a clever design the first is that the blade is completely concealed so it should be very hard for your finger to accidentally be cut the second is this box which holds the cutter closed ensuring no accidents while it's in storage the smallest cutout is actually the ideal size for cutting ptfe tube and i found the other cutouts were great for automotive use in this case silicon vacuum hose i found that if i rotated it as i applied pressure i would get an extremely nice flat cut on the end of the tube our final category is clamping tools there are a lot of printable vices on thingiverse like this mini machine vise by haimek but i went for this even smaller remixed nano vise by prima based on the thingiverse comments i printed the knurled screw part three times at 100 95 and 90 scale for me the 100 scale screw fit perfectly but if you were having fitment issues you could scale this part down one area i did need to make an alteration was using a blade to take the sharp edge off these inner mating surfaces after doing this and before your final assembly i'd recommend applying some grease to inside the thread and the ball on the end of the screw the screw can then be inserted into the main body so the head sits just proud we then slide the clamp in from above and continue to turn the screw which slots the three parts together and completes our assembly i think a vice this small is particularly good for jewelry makers forgive me if i don't actually file my wedding ring but hopefully you can see that it's a pretty good way of holding it for some filing and sanding it also holds it quite securely as well this is also a great tool for holding small and fiddly work pieces when you want to use a sharp tool like a dremel and you don't really want your fingers anywhere near the blade it's also great for clamping thin parts where your fingers might otherwise get in the way our final printed tool is this kant twist clamp by 3d printing world this clamp does have a lot of parts to be printed but it also has excellent dedicated assembly instructions embedded on the thingiverse page the only deviation i had from these instructions was again applying synthetic grease inside the threads as well as any junctions where parts were meant to rotate it was also an excellent demonstration of the thwack for tapping together the pieces of the frame as well as inserting the locking pins without damaging the printed clamp this clamp has a wide range of motion opening up quite wide yet closing up enough to hold quite slender objects i think this is an ideal tool for clamping together the halves of objects that you're gluing together this mechanism gives you a lot of control as well as sufficient strength so now i'm going to have to print some more that brings us to the end of my list but you should know with 3d printing you can go much much further if you have a dremel tool you can convert it into a table saw a mini disc sander or even a mini pedestal drill and you can even convert your standard hand drill into a drill press of sorts there's a lot of great printable tools online so please

on nintendo switch thanks to the game super mario 3d all-stars today's episode is all about the rainbow ride we're going to show you guys exactly how to get all seven of the stars in our 100 through so thanks so much for coming thank you for enjoying the entire series thanks for watching uh all of my fun attempts at all these different stars thank you for playing along with and just overall thanks for being there you guys are amazing so rainbow ride is going to be the semi-finale meaning we only have a couple more things to do in the game right we got to go beat the final bowser we have to collect a whole bunch of different things so it's gonna be a fun time all right here we go we're gonna jump in and let's go on a ride let's go okay so here we are rainbow ride course 15. cruiser crossing over the rainbow i'm so ready for this let's hit it let's hit it rainbow ride so now rainbow ride is pretty much an auto scroller kind of level where the only way that you get adventure all the way up top is to actually jump on the magic carpets now the interesting thing about the magic carpets is that if you jump off of the magic carpet and fall off like that you'll absolutely lose so don't do that all right anyway what i'm trying to say is that the magic carpets are pretty annoying because they will flash and disappear if you're not on top of them for i don't know maybe five seconds there's some sort of like in-game counter that's like hey we're detecting that you're not on this magic carpet so why don't you just go ahead and disappear so as cool as is it as it is to just jump off and just kind of wait you have to be very very careful about that so anyway let's continue on yeah here we go all right we got a lack of two coming this way all right likitude wow ho ho lackadoo just almost sacrificed himself to mess up my jump sorry buddy not gonna happen guy all right so this level is pretty gigantic in the actual scope of how much air space there is and how much like area the entire place it don't i think it may or may not be bigger than uh bob on battlefield it's a really big one and there's a couple different splits that you have to deal with so yeah just be very careful as you're going through this and just follow my lead i'm gonna try to remember where exactly every single one of these different stars are you can get them in order you get them out of border it honestly doesn't matter as long as you get them all right so i'm going to take the right path here the right path will allow me to get to the very top of a certain area and that certain area is going to be that big wooden structure that seems to be oh my god it seems to be over there wow i almost got burned what is that yeah i don't actually want to find out let me just do this yeah no that's not gonna touch me but these things will so yeah you gotta watch it i think yeah i just gotta do two jumps oh my goodness all right so we gotta go on that airship the airship and that should fly me above yeah okay okay we're making it here we go that one up is very tempting i know you want to just jump off and get it it's so tempting you can go for it if you want i would advise against it it's not worth missing your flight and this is a donut block okay yep see ya oh my gosh thank you i'm just gonna long jump here all right so now this is interesting because you just have to jump and hit it done i want to say that's the star that we're aiming for uh cruiser crossing over the rainbow yeah that was the one okay got it all right crews are crossing over the rainbow we're in this let's go big house in the sky well here we go big house in the sky now if you remember from the previous star we had an option of choosing the left or the right carpet at a certain spot and now what we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking the left carpet and going to the big house in the sky the big house in the sky is that uh yeah does that have another meeting somewhere maybe it's localized in some sort of way shape or form go to the big house in the sky all right this guy i need to not deal with him he almost rocked me last time all right here we go do some squats actually that's not the proper form for squats but we'll let mario go he's just crouching alright well here we are it's time time to make it all the way to the top come on mario go quick man no rainbow rainbow cruise is actually pretty fun like i like this level it's got some nice little elements to it kind of reminds me of rainbow road and mario kart i don't get a little this is a road there's a rainbow road it's a road where you go absolutely all right so like it is actually bothering me now you cannot do that to me like a dude lack a dude oh my gosh i think you can do this yeah get pushed and then flip yeah yeah that's the good way of doing that part so you don't have to worry about doing two flips and turning around all right here's the big house in the sky big house in the sky so let's go how is it floating i don't know these are the questions we just don't ask now what's cool about this is that there's a fireplace yeah someone installed a little fireplace kind of looks like minecraft inside here all right so now when we're inside here we do have to hop off a little bit because that fireplace is going to spit some hot fire at you but don't hop off too much or else your carpet is going to go away like that right over that way that we were very close to getting abandoned there's no other magic carpets that come through so i'll keep that in mind as you're playing do not get abandoned ship all right here we go do not get shocked okay get shocked that's fine okay here we go here we go pay close attention because this part gets hard especially if you get burnt do not get burnt it's like it's perfectly timed to actually burn you oh okay very close we're gonna do a little twirls here it's gonna twirl its way up and we made it yes we made it to the big house in the sky what do you know about it pretty cool huh [Music] oh okay it was a little hard a little hard just a little bit let's move on to the next one coin's a mass in a maze all right i know where this one's at let's go get it coin's a mass in a maze this one's going to be interesting because we have to do two things in here we have to activate a cannon by finding a little pink bob on buddy and we have to collect all of the eight red coins which are in a maze and if you guys have been playing along with me since the very beginning you're already familiar with doing mazes and wall jumps where as soon as mario hits a wall there's a small window of i don't know maybe like half of a second where you have to press the jump button again in order to allow mario to do another wall jump all right but anyway as you can see over here this is where we are going we're going straight into here yep that's kind of where i wanted to go i wanted to get that one coin right off the bat but i don't think we're gonna be able to access that right off the bat okay and that guy literally almost pushed me off so let's not do that all right let's do this okay let's get our first coinage let's run across here let's see what else we got okay you can kind of see the shadows of where all the coins are at i don't think i could jump back up no i can't oh no maybe i can do this hey beautiful okay so i can't do anything there let's go here no thanks okay that's cool here we're just gonna go this way that was definitely not the way to go but i'm not complaining uh-huh the last one is going to be a little bit tougher to do because you got to do a little bit of a slide or you can just long jump i'm sure that okay that's not the way to do that how about this doing mario's side jump mario side jump is actually the best jump in his arsenal try to change my mind that one right there where you pull the control stick directly opposite of where mario's running and then you press jump oh no no we're not done yet no we're not okay okay so don't get the star whatever you do don't get the star come this way come this way do this oh shoot don't blow me up do this okay and then talk to your best friend okay so dude prepares the cannon cutscene to cannon and then you're done okay got it [Music] and now we went okay so you had to do that and once you do that you're all set and ready to go coin's a mass and a maze 24 save and continue here we go next up we have swinging in the breeze swinging in the breeze oh my gosh swing on the breeze oh well let's see where it takes us swinging in the breeze swinging in the breeze man trying to remember yeah we gotta go that way there's something over there there's a star over that away that might be swinging in the breeze over there like you can see lakitu as well yeah let's see what where it brings us there's two stars all right let's see swinging in the breeze yeah that's exactly because they're swinging over here with that thing i don't know where this breeze concept is but dude yo that guy swooped me could this be the breeze oh yeah here it is this is very breezy yep here we go oh we got this momentum now watch out cheese big piece of cheese looks like a sponge all right we're in goomba kick him to the screen see ya oof no no no we smooshed them all right here we go swing swing swing bada batter this one has a lot of grip on it so you're not gonna slide down it it's awesome it's very grippy okay swinging in the breeze dude got it that was good i like swinging in the breeze that was very fun oh man i uh so as you can see you had to rotate the camera around in order to see even more of the level that may not be apparent to you from default camera view right tricky triangles now this one is going to be a fun one provided that mario does everything we want him to do so remember in the previous star we took a turn towards the camera we moved the camera all the way around in order to discover that there's a little bit more than the eye can see we're into the exact same concept and head over to those triangles and that star in the distant background that away so we should be set by jumping over this way and sliding on down this come on camera work with me man all right no worries here we go all right watch out for that shy guy right there he's pretty bad that fly guy the fly guy will come on over and he will like either throw a fireball at ya or he'll just like kamikaze right into you so watch him like a hawk [Music] all right here we go mario's running but don't run too fast because this little cheese sponge nice textures man all right goomba's not even suspecting this kick kicked him right towards you who caught the goomba all right watch out for this part here all right here we go big jumping yeah tricky triangles how tricky are they huh how tricky are they so tricky dang it shortcut oh my gosh that was very tricky dude i thought i'd get in my first try i was out here acting like i was gonna get it there we go now was that hard tell me that was hard well guess what it wasn't i guess if you did like the triple jump through and snuck up you skipped out on like five little triangles so you're good you're good all right guys 116 stars out of 120 that means that we are almost done somewhere over the rainbow somewhere over the rainbow okay so remember when we were in the maze and we were looking for those red coins we went over to the ba-bomb buddy we wall jumped all the way on the on the side went towards the very top and then we got the little pink bob on buddy he activated the cannon for us remember that yep it was only like five minutes ago now with that being said we are going to be using that said cannon in order to do some work oh gosh we're doing some work and we really only have one shot at this if we get it wrong we have to do this entirety all over again so i could feel the pressure i can absolutely feel the pressure and i'm not gonna buckle i'm not gonna buckle under the pressure no man we got this you and me we absolutely got this check this out all right so remember that there's a fork in the road when it comes to these two uh little magic carpets so that being said we're gonna take the right fork and we're gonna make our way to that top of the airship that had the the heavy winds right there's a cannon on top of there and we're gonna go launch mario somewhere over the rainbow all right you got to watch out now you can't just jump you can't just jump on the middle of that thing and just like wait because remember you have the cooldown give the cooldown of your magic carpet that will disappear and there is no spare magic carpet that you can get no spare magic carpet all right we're in don't look at that one up i know you want it we have two lives we're okay we don't need like a hundred lives no we're done okay so get this [Music] okay we're here all right let the wind blow you a little bit watch out for lack of two and then now we're inside the cannon okay here we go the moment we've been waiting for cannon practice somewhere over the rainbow okay so now we have to line up the cursor with the actual pull you got to get that bottom cursor directly on it it's so hard it's so okay there we go there we go look at how perfect that is right you see that perfectly aligned and then now we're going to launch straight directly in the middle just like that boom over the rainbow baby oh right on to it watch out for chuckster over here chuckster is not a friend but this is our friend right here floating in mid-air levitating yes so cool a rainbow ride folks rain bow ride i love this level okay now comes the hard part of collecting a hundred actual coins i don't know how we're gonna do it well a hundred coins it is um honestly we're just gonna have to figure it out uh this is one of the last times where we're gonna have to collect a hundred coins so i'm gonna miss ya i'm gonna miss you other than uh playing in super mario sunshine or whatever yeah i'm definitely gonna miss collecting 100 coins all right all right let's take a look let's take a look where exactly well obviously we got to go to the red coin island that's a gibbon and i have to pop lakitu for his coinage oh good okay i think we're good oh there's dude the coins don't even spawn in you can't see him from a mile away 29 right off the bat not bad and then plus the the eight times two this guy gone wow what did that feel like what did that feel like okay well lost the coin but we have these where oh we did that on our first try hello i didn't even remember that that was a thing 60 coins in man we just got to get the red coins now okay that's not too bad come on i just wanna get up there there we go 68 70. i got robbed of one i did really okay hi hey guys it's me seven where's eight oh it's the one on the slide there's something like right there oh there we go there's eight okay so that's 76 i don't know where we're getting the rest of these coins like no joke all right well let's uh let's hope and pray that we could find a good amount of other coins totally not getting nervous at all we got this we got this here we go 77 i would have 78 right now if that bob

y'all i don't know tomorrow the next day the day after that who knows all right yeah", "FaNLkd0rzXk": "[Music] [Applause] um [Music] [Applause] so a lot of you probably remember dan from the youtube channel what's inside he used to live really close to me so we'd hang out and do videos and projects and stuff all the time but he moved away and uh with 2020 we haven't seen each other a whole lot and i'm sure he misses all of our adventures together so what i've decided to do is 3d print a 4 000 pound statue of myself out of concrete and plop it next to his pool at his new house so he doesn't feel so lonely let's get started so let me explain how all of this works normally a massive 3d concrete printer isn't used to do statues but we're taking some liberties with the technology usually you would see the designs being used in landscape architecture or commercial facades or even sometimes structural columns the possibilities are kind of endless structural elements or even custom furniture with a printable area of 17 feet by 13 feet by 12 feet there's a lot of space to work with let me explain how the whole printer works so we start with this massive shelf of dry mortar which gets forked lift into this machine right here which is a hopper the hopper takes that dry powder coming down through this machine and up through the screw into this massive silo the silo is what holds most of the powder until the printing starts all the powder comes down here to the bottom and then once again gets corkscrewed up into the top still dry powder up there and then comes down to this blue machine here we know we can't make concrete out of dry powder so it comes down here to the powder dosing unit where the add mixture and the water get added together to make the mortar what's interesting is that the water itself is actually chilled because when the concrete is mixed together it's an exothermic reaction which generates a lot of heat and that cooler water helps in the printing process then the mortar pump takes it along this tube here up into this machine the giant gantry where all of the action happens this long arm right here is actually called the printer head and it's where the concrete is dosed so as you can tell it's quite a bit more complicated than your average 3d printer with all of the temperature and the chemicals and the concrete being pumped into this massive machine i think it's going to turn out pretty cool to get the correct proportions and dimensions for my body we had to 3d scan myself by taking a camera and circling myself multiple times and then inputting that video file into a program that could digitally map the data points into a 3d image which turned it into a pretty decent rendering of my body we had to clean it up and polish it up for the final rendering but the final statue is going to be a pretty good representation of me it took michelangelo about two years to make the david statue we're gonna do it here in about two hours so we're gonna start by printing the legs and we're gonna print it in three separate sections we could go just from the ground all the way to the top but since this is super complex we decided to stay on the safe side and just assemble it after the fact we're in utah right now and you can actually see mister surrounding the whole printing area because it's so dry we have to keep the concrete moist as it's printing printhead is getting lined up with the palette where we'll be printing on you can see the laser right there which is keeping the track of where the printhead is going to be just making sure there's no obstructions right now before it starts printing right now the printer is just spewing out the first little bit of concrete just so that it's going to be a clean and uniform mixture as it starts with my legs and this is all moving in real time the printer is actually this fast so right here we see my left foot and my right foot and then we have a center structure in the middle to keep the whole thing supported as we are printing we're putting sand right here inside of the feet because as the feet come over the top of themselves there needs to be some kind of support inside of it to help keep it structural as it's building up so the printer right now is moving up and down the gantry as well as this shaft here can go up and down as the legs are being built we have the mortar being pumped up through the black hose coming down and then we have the activator being pumped in right at the same time next to the nozzle the activator being pumped in next to the nozzle is what makes the concrete cure or harden super fast so that each of these layers can support each other as they go up you can see the sand here doing its job supporting the layers as the top of my shoe gets created once we get about to my ankles the statue will start to support itself and the sand will no longer be needed and when we lift the whole thing up the sand will just come out the bottom and everything happening at the exact same time produces a successful print you can see the exothermic reaction happening on top of the concrete right now as the steam comes off of it and the moisture in the air from these misters is what helps keep that from cracking and allows it to dry at the correct rate so we've been going for about 10 minutes now you can see that we're almost up to my knees we can see the massive center support between my legs and the concrete is still coming out nice and neat it's going to be hollow all the way through the inside and normally you can just leave a print just like that but since we're going to transport it four hours on the freeway we are going to fill this up with concrete which makes it heavier but also makes it so that it won't break while we're traveling with it we want to surprise dan with a complete statue and not a pile of gravel still kind of blows my mind the level of detail we're able to get out of the concrete printing you can see the kind of wrinkles from where my pants were when we did the scanning the statue itself isn't even printing like directly in one straight line it's building off of itself as it goes up which is super impressive we are just about done getting up there to the belt line give or take it's kind of crazy to see how tall this is my head is only coming to the beltline of the statue dan's gonna be so excited a bunch of water should start coming out of the nozzle here in a second which should clean it up and get it ready for our next print so you can see this trail right here is the original concrete line that kind of started the whole print and we can tell that it's already hardening which is much different than normal concrete because of that activator that's being added near the nozzle normal 3d printing with you know the plastic filament takes forever but this is surprisingly fast so now we are getting ready to print the second piece we have my legs over there and that circular shape you see right there is the base of the torso which is going to end up on top of my legs the cool thing about this facility is that this print area is on these rollers right here and the whole thing can just be conveyed out to a semi truck dock over there because this thing is gonna weigh around four or five thousand pounds when we're done and uh carrying it out by hand is gonna be difficult so it's good that we have a method of unloading it down here at the end of the dock you can tell this right here is my belt line and then this is where my hands were resting on my hip since the angle of my arm here is so intense we're going to prop it up with some foam really quick it's already kind of started to harden and solidify there's just a lot of weight as the arm builds up and comes out over here and so we're gonna make sure it doesn't crack along the seam while it has time to harden the rest of the way so the concrete printer has different nozzles this one is a 30 millimeter but they can go all the way up to 50 or all the way down to 20 depending on what the project requires 30 is just a good middle ground so now it's pretty easy to tell what it is this is my back with my arms right here off to the sides these inner cavities are what we're going to be punching out later oh yeah not too shabby turned out good you can kind of see the resemblance so it's interesting inside of here is actually kind of like a sauna it's all like steamy and humid because all of the heat that's escaping while it's curing or drying if we take the laser thermometer we can see that we are at 47 degrees while this one which has had a couple hours to cure is down at 35 already and these over here which have been done for a couple days now they're down about 22. so as the prints dry or cure they finish and get colder so now it's time to print the head and it's kind of the same basic concept as the feet since the curve of my shoulders is so tight we're adding some sand and foam underneath to kind of support the 3d print as it grows and that kind of layer construction is the same with any kind of 3d printing and the bigger the statue the easier it is to print the gradual angles since there's more room for the layers to build off each other that's why we decided to go with a 12 foot tall statue for dan's surprise even if it will weigh as much as an elephant when we're done see how close we can get to the profile i think i'm looking up like this it's kind of crazy and get that level of detail with concrete you can even see where my eyes and nose are this is insane almost there let's take a look at the head oh no should i grow a ponytail like that let me know down in the comments so obviously a statue standing on its own two legs isn't going to be super balanced so we need to build a base which will be about a foot tall and about four feet wide with sufficient mass to keep the statue upright while it's standing we're going to use a weave pattern which just kind of looks cool then we'll infill the base with concrete just like we're going to do the statue later along with some rebar and some anchor points for the crane when we lifted over dan's fence into the backyard so the prints are done they are stiff right now we're going to give them a couple more days to solidify before we infill them and transport them it's a while to be a couple days for us it'll just be a couple seconds for you so it is time to put myself together the concrete has had about three days to cure so it's not as hard as it's gonna be in like a week or so but it's hard enough that we can finally assemble myself on the base which already has concrete and rebar put in it so we can crane it over to dan's pool you know the gift he never wanted i do have some clear hose since it's gonna be next to dan's pool we're going to turn it into a fountain hopefully that works out but it should be a pretty fun day we're putting some plastic wrap around the leg so that the straps when we suspend it from the forklift don't rub up against the concrete [Music] so since i'm dropping this statue off at dan and lincoln's house from you know the youtube channel what's inside they're probably going to want to see what's inside the statue and i'm going to leave them a bunch of presents that'll blow their minds so this thing is much bigger than i initially anticipated um we have rebar down in the sides as well as bent down into the arms so when the concrete solidifies around the rebar it'll give it a bit more structure as we are transporting it four hours down to st george we're using quick set concrete so it solidifies in about 30 to 40 minutes and since we're doing it in increments it's not putting a whole lot of pressure on the layers below it as it solidifies and dries if we did it all at once there might be too much pressure at the bottom and the whole thing might spill out so we're being careful [Music] so we've put silicone between the two layers of concrete and that silicone will help the concrete from spilling out between the two halves and the previous concrete was right about here the new concrete will finish right about here which will give some structural rigidity to the midsection right above the belt line it's time to drill a mouth for our statue and we know that the mouth is about halfway between the nose and the chin so we're gonna go right about here to get through concrete we know that concrete is a mohs five to seven give or take so i have a diamond drill bit here which has diamonds laced around the edges and since diamonds are level 10 we should be able to get through the cement just fine perfect the massive concrete vibrator is used to jiggle up my internals so the concrete can seep into every nook and cranny while it's still liquid once it gets hard it's game over there's no more adjusting hard concrete and now it's time we bring over the best looking part of the project my head we've put a piece of rebar up in through the shoulders to kind of keep the concrete in the head and the shoulders together and uh hopefully that holds it during our four hour jaunt down the road so every time we seem to redo the calculations on this it weighs more and more we started off thinking it would be 4 000 pounds and i think we're up to about 6 000 now and this time around instead of slinging the head we're actually going to leave it on a pallet and just kind of wiggle it into place on my shoulders right where a head should be and it is done even though we use quick set concrete inside the statue which hardens in about 30 or 40 minutes it still takes about seven days for it to get to about 70 percent of its full holding capacity but you know after about a week you can drive on it and walk on it and that's when we're gonna start transporting it as well to make sure the whole thing is structurally sound then it won't fall apart if we hit a bump while we're driving but overall i think it turned out pretty good pretty uh similar likeness to me it's pretty impressive we can get that level of detail with a 3d concrete printer like if we look at the ears you can even see my ear outline in the statue i will give him a couple more days to stand here and dry it'll be a couple days for us but just a couple seconds for you guys and there he is in all of his glory ready to transport now when i started this project i didn't quite comprehend the magnitude of transporting a six thousand pound statue of myself four hours down to st george there's just no easy way to do it we know we can't transport it upright because it would probably hit like an overpass or an electrical wire or something like that and so we have to lay the statue down and there needs to be something underneath the statue that'll support all of the pressure points equally so what we need is a mattress luckily i have friends over at purple and they're pretty confident that their mattress can support all six thousand pounds of me we're doubling it up and using two full-sized purple mattresses so purple has a few different mattresses this is one of their two inch purple grids the purple grid is designed to dynamically flex under pressure providing complete support which is exactly what we're after with our statue now we just have to get me from here to here in one piece the purple part of the purple mattress is made with a hyper elastic polymer and the purple grid is built to last under practically any pressure there's over 1800 open-air channels that let you sleep cool not that the statue will actually need to but for my personal purple mattress that i've had for about a year now during the summer it's great and during the winter we had some flannel sheets to help warm things up a bit it's definitely a cool mattress the purple grid inherently has motion isolating technology to relieve all those pressure points so the statue will be evenly supported all the way from its head down to its concrete little toes this is going to be quite the durability test for a purple mattress i don't think any mattress is specifically designed to handle six thousand pounds it'll be interesting to see what it looks like tomorrow after we lift the statue back up so we're using a long tether around the waist to keep everything balanced we're gonna set it down under the trailer and just lay it back onto the mattresses so we've added a pallet and a 4x4 to kind of conform to the cavity between my shoulder blades and then the mattresses should cushion everything else got myself strapped in tight now it's time to take the statue the mattresses the trailer and the truck all the way down to st george to keep dan company [Music] [Music] [Music] we are right behind dan's house right now so he could look over his fence that's his house right over there he could look over his fence any time and see us so it could just be go time at any point the statue did survive the trip very well we are excited about that there it is thank you pulling in behind dan's house right now it is definitely time [Music] [Applause] [Music] raising up yes finally it's happening that is six thousand pounds being raised up into the air right now [Music] yeah careful careful looking pretty good let's see how the mattresses did not bad check that out these mattresses have gone over 300 miles with 6 000 pounds laying on top of them and they're still totally fine let me try it out that's not a testament to a good mattress i don't know what is huge thanks to purple for sponsoring this video and for helping us out i don't think i don't think the statue would have made it without the soft support underneath so i'll leave a link down in the video description cambry and i really do love our purple mattress so it wasn't just a sponsored video we do like these guys now let's get the statue in dan's yard this crane is an 80 ton crane which means it can lift a lot of weight near the crane's base but the further you go away from the crane the less weight it can hold kind of like if you have weight down near your arm it's easy to hold but the farther away you get from your body the heavier it gets same thing with the crane that's why we had to get the 80 ton crane to carry the 6 000 pound statue and so far it's totally worth it so far so good i'm gonna run around to the front and meet him by the pool yes we tried gluing these masks down to the bottom but it didn't stick apparently rubber and concrete are hard to glue together hi leslie all right we're getting dan out of his office right now come on out buddy so you know how you want me to move down to saint george right dude i don't know what's happening right now but i'm really nervous to go out here and see what's happening so i've actually decided to make it a little less lonely down here for you and i've 3d printed a 6 000 statue of myself what out of concrete what is this look at this crane we're gonna bring that over here and put it next to your pool and just keep you company it's concrete concrete solid concrete six thousand pounds you're bringing that into my yard uh-huh permanently permanently i mean it's six thousand pounds so good luck oh my god see that pool right there oh no way okay that's kind of amazing actually yeah the closer it gets the bigger it gets it's so big oh my gosh like we really are keeping this forever yep it is now yours you are the lucky proud new owners of a jerry where should we put it so that someday if we need to see what's inside of it we can do it actually i have put inside of it no uh-huh no but my audience doesn't know that yet so i bleeped it out and so what they are going to be expecting a video on your end we put a little further away from the water then look at leslie it's a present so i have to say thank you what in the world look what's come out of his mouth yeah it's a fountain bro i'm not going to put it like yeah i didn't know it was a fountain [Laughter] remember that time when i gave you like thousands of tootsie rolls yep yeah this is quite the payback here it just one up you bro yeah i took it that's good yes that was a logistical experience trying to get this whole thing done i am so glad it is here and in one piece where did you where did you just yeah there's a place called pikas in south jordan that does 3d concrete printing you wait till you see the machine it is incredible so what it's a good thing you don't have hair right that would have made it a little more tricky it would have been way harder to print a concrete statue with hair my face hurts anxious this whole time process it and i do thank you for the gesture this is not really like the aesthetic i was going it looks so grand the kids are gonna be like what the hell oh yeah where are they that's funny uh so there's without the nozzle i like it i just uh we just need to move a little closer to the pool for as large as the statue is i thought it would have a little bit more like spray i do like the water feature though it's pretty funny seeing the six thousand pound statue flying through the air was definitely the highlight of my day dan now that you've had a couple hours to process what do you i don't know how this even came to be and i'm not sad about it like it's actually really cool i was a little nervous about what my wife was going to say about it but she kind of likes it she's like it's like modern art and the fact that there is i don't know if you've told them this inside of this hidden i'm excited to get inside of it but i'm going to keep it around for a little while i've got some plans maybe put some clothes on it maybe paint it we've got some things going on that i'm going to leave it here for a while well i'm glad you enjoy it the company we worked with for this project is called pika so if you're interested in 3d concrete printing from a engineering or industrial perspective i'll leave a link for them down in the description as well huge thanks to dan good luck with the statue it's 6 000 pounds there's no moving it from here i'm pretty curious how you're gonna get inside this thing come hang out with us on instagram and twitter and thanks again for watching i'll see you around wow", "qsvpU7G5IJg": "once upon a time two brothers were bored ayore yeah will we should build a bicycle we do that every single day will what about a bicycle with an engine that's a motorbike will um what about a bicycle with an engine and wings oh i never heard of that before i wonder what that would be called that would be called an airplane i think this video was brought to you by blinkist on the 17th of december of 1903 the wright brothers made history by flying the first piloted heavier than haircraft that they invented and built the first flight covered 37 meters in 12 seconds and just like that the first airplane made its mark to achieve this the brothers used a self-designed four piston engine that was very low power but also very low weight with only 81 kilograms without the fuel this little engine allowed the brothers to have a little taste of the sky but the rest of humanity was hungry as well so as you can imagine things evolved pretty quickly in less than no time airplanes became common the engines used got more powerful and lighter the combination of a powerful petrol engine and the propeller allowed the airplanes to travel longer and faster but unfortunately this setup had a big drawback the usage of propellers puts a limit on the speed of the aircraft because once the tips of the propeller reach near max speeds shock waves are created that increase vibration and drag one easy solution to this problem would be to fly higher where the air is thinner less drag but because the air is thinner there's also less oxygen for the combustion on the engine so power is lost anyway another way to solve this problem would be to still fly higher but somehow find a way to use the power of the engine to force more air into the combustion chamber of course this is easier said than done nonetheless someone found a solution in 1930 a british pilot named frank whittle submitted a patent that described a new kind of engine that used the dynamic compressor and the turbine connected to the same axis to accelerate air and produce thrust it took eight years for whittle to make the new engine work but when it did it marked the beginning of jet powered flight using the one and only turbo jet engine the turbojet engine is nowadays commonly used in commercial aircrafts that transport everybody to everywhere it's the big cylindrical thing that looks like a fan and is attached to the wings of the airplane this weird-looking cylindrical fan is able to lift off hundreds of thousands of kilograms off the ground but how does it do that in principle these engines are pretty simple they have a compressor that sucks air in the air is used to burn fuel in the combustion chamber and the hot gases rush through the exhaust making the turbine spin in the process because the turbine is connected to the same shaft as the compressor the turbine powers the compressor so it's kind of a vicious cycle now this seems pretty simple right so why is it so hard to build one well to be honest i don't know but i'm about to find out because i intend to build one i'm guessing that for me it will be even harder because i don't want to work with metal my only means of production are a couple of 3d printers and that's about it i mean i recently found a way to 3d print ceramic parts that can withstand very high temperatures so i might be able to use that i'm pretty sure i can 3d print the compressor part in plastic because it's before the combustion so yeah let's start with that i 3d printed an impeller in resin and a diffuser in pla the impeller accelerates the air and the diffuser slows it down enters the speed into pressure this works like when it's raining small droplets at a fast pace but under the trees the rain slows down and the droplets get bigger the diffuser is like the trees i think since i was 3d printing i also made a turbine in resin and a support for the shaft so i could make some tests for the shaft i used the eight millimeter steel rod that i threaded on the tips after all the 3d printing i had a lot of support material to remove and you know what that means support removal asmr [Music] [Music] after assembling everything i gave the setup a test with compressed air and it seemed to be running pretty smoothly the blue part is the turbine stator its function is to redirect the hot gases into the turbine blades inside this setup i have at least three parts that i can 3d print in plastic and those are the access support the stator and of course the turbine so maybe i can try to 3d print them in ceramics to 3d print ceramic parts i use a ceramic resin called forcelite that is 17 resin and 83 ceramic because there's 17 resin in there i need to post process the parts in a kiln and burn out the resin the problem with this is that the parts shrink 17 at 1200 degrees celsius what creates stresses that can deform and crack the parts to deal with this i have to design the parts with some limitations in mind for example i can't design parts that are thicker than one millimeter i give it a shot in 3d printed the stator and the turbine in ceramic resin after that i burned out the resin and the results were not good the stator was a mess with cracks all over the place and the turbine had distortions that renders it useless since it needs to be very well balanced this project isn't going very well is it this turbine is essentially rubbish what do i do now delete your channel tomato lord yes it is i on the flesh and i have worse news for you

the video okay so i solved the problem of the turbine and that's great but i still don't know how to make the shaft support or the stator the problem with the ceramic resin is that it has 17 resin in it so when you burn out the resin it messes with the structure of the part if only the resin was like separated like on the outside molds okay so instead of 3d printing the parts directly in ceramic resin i printed out some molds and filled them with some high temperature cement that is used in fireplaces to make sure the cement would get evenly distributed i used my vibrating saw to remove air [Music] bubbles [Music] okay the parts are pretty good but there's still a lot of excess material which i'll have to remove using the dremel you know bobby the card style [Music] so [Music] okay so far i have the compressor the shaft support the turbine stator and the turbine but i'm still missing a key element the combustion chamber now i don't think i can find a way to make the combustion chamber that doesn't involve working with metal so i got a welding machine i never welded in my life before and i'm pretty [ __ ] at soldiering so this will go smoothly i want to learn to weld from scratch so i'm going to start simple i'm going to spot well some thin sheet metal and maybe watch some tutorials let's see how that from goes today we're going to be make loading uh oh 30 22 gauge [Music] i'm going to show you three common mistakes in sheet metal hello the first one's going to be a hi-lo look at that fast numero uno it looks like a disease the second one's going to be too big of a gap and the third one is going to be blowing through strike and we just took carried it nice nice and easy down the groove the puddle looks pretty cool it doesn't it still looks like rubbish but it's better i think [Music] i forgot to connect the electrode again electrode let's go here i think i'm ready to try it on the real thing i was not [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] you know to center it yeah now i can center i can weld this very nice [Music] it is working [Music] once the combustion chamber was ready i had all the parts that i needed so i assembled the engine and gave it a test there once was a ship that put to sea and the name of the ship was the bully hearty the winds blew hard her bow dipped down all blow me belly boys blow okay that was a lot of work uh it's time to test the engine i can barely wait i really hope it works but let us pray please god of thermodynamics help me get this engine to self sustain the combustion without burning my house in the name of calling first isaac newton and propane fuel amen a little bit of the compressed air look at that no friction no friction bay i almost burned my face [Music] little bit of lubricant so you don't overheat the bearings and die on my hands [Music] round two fight [Music] as you can see the ball bearing is captured it's dead for some reason the lubricant is not getting to the ball bearing yeah it overheated i need to replace it and we are back so the problem was with the ceramic ball bearing it had a a rubber casing uh like a cage that melted and caused the friction i substitute it with a ball bearing without a cage i mean it has a cage but it's a metal one anyway let's proceed lubricant yo master lubricated engine my grandfather always used to say you can't have too much lubrication maybe that's why you have 13 kids [Music] little bit more lubricant okay so i substituted the torch with a spark plug and i'm going to use intact the bot to ignite the fuel let's see if that helps potential in three two one [Music] let's go another time okay [Applause] [Music] [Music] i feel it's so close uh it's like with a pulse jack it's like it clicks and then i can run it [Music] basically [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] unfortunately after that run i couldn't run any more tests because i made the engine run for longer than it was prepared to so i melted and damaged a lot of components but who cares it worked i mean it was a 10 second run but it doesn't matter it worked so you can bet your asses on making your version too i have to confess that building a turbojet engine it's been a long dream of mine since it's my favorite engine i also think that there's no better way to understand how something works than building it i know not everyone watching my videos as a 3d printer at home to replicate this project and that's the reason why on my last video i gave away a 3d printer to the most liked comments suggesting a theme for a future video the winner was jericho and he suggested that as a half million sub celebration i could use a vacuum cannon to crush tomatoes i like that idea here you can see jekyll with his new 3d printer if you also want to win a 3d printer all you need to do is subscribe to the channel leave a like on this video and post a comment suggesting a theme for a future video the most liked comment will receive a brand new 3d printer now before i end the video i have to talk to you about ayush ayush is a young man from india that contacted me because he really wants a 3d printer but can't afford one he tried to build its own but it wasn't really working properly so in this video i decided to give away two 3d printers well this is everything for today thank you for watching and remember tomatoes are disgusting you got mail what dear mr integza my name is tomato lord jr you have killed my father prepare to die may the weathermen come to bring us sugar and tea and rum one day when the tongan is done we'll take our leave and go she hadn't been two weeks from shore when down on her right whaleboar the captain called all hands and swore he'd take

next that was in Frankfurt Germany I'd never been before it was incredible for next is the industrial additive manufacturing show that you just can't miss an industrial additive manufacturing is so different yet so familiar to those of us who tinker and hobby around with consumer based 3d printers we were there we got to visit a few booths and I'd love to show you right here on 3d printing nerd I've heard from many many people that I need to look at craft bot 3d printers the machines that craft unique makes are great because from what I hear they're built incredibly well and they have this ability to create amazing 3d prints time and time again we spoke with craft unique at their booth that formed next and I finally got to see these machines up close and in person and they were really cool I can't wait for you to see this one because I think we're gonna get one of these into the studio soon we got a chance to stop by their booth at forum next and see what makes these crafts about 3d printers unique have a look hey Christian hi Joe how are you doing fine thank you you'll be tired now I'm a little bit yeah you're a little tired too aren't you yes we are tired but it doesn't matter because there's awesome stuff here such as that new machine yes the new flow generation yeah craft both flow generation printers it's huge it is it's one of the best and biggest plug-and-play idec's machine on the market well let's go over it so talk to me about this machine it obviously looks massive in size what's the build volume and the build volume is 425 250 and 500 indicee 500 and Z yes Wow okay give a great little UI up front yes and also it's powered by the Raspberry Pi computer model because it runs on Linux that's great it's really great it has a lot of power to handle the camera and the speaker the touchscreen and later on some additional features can be at dawn well if you if you have that in there it gives you that flexibility in the future for yes dating things just in case something comes up that you may not have thought about before yes yeah they just asked about if we can attach a ratified e-reader then it's no problem there's no problem do that yes let's see filament is on the back it looks like is that right yes but you can place it wherever you want you can see the screws on the top so it's no problem if you want to place it on the side or in the front if you have any other faces just just do it it's no problem or the extruder is similar to the previous machines somehow yes we introduced the all-metal hotend two years ago and now every printer has the old metal turn now and go up to 300 Celsius Oh perfect so 300 Zee there and that's a heated bed it looks like it's is that Kapton tape on there yes it's a captain teapot that it's also and it's removable yes it's removable oh is this Lex yes it sure does it is yes and if you go up to 100 110 sizes wow I don't see on the bed yeah I noticed some cutouts on the front yes what is that what is that circle one cuz so I would imagine the longer ones are for being able to grab it easy yes but the circle one what does that do it's really good you are asking because we are very proud of that solution a solution it's not just a hole you can touch the head in the hole in two directions X Y and then touch the hole with the other head again with the two direction and between the two deviation you know how the two heads are not completely parallel I know what you're doing oh so typically on a dual extrusion machine you have to align the heads or at least the machine has to know at the offsets at which the nozzles are for proper dual material rinsing but yeah I'm used to printing lines you're saying that the nozzle uses that hole and touches it in the different axes yes and then it just computes the difference and yes and you are there it's no more lies no more counting no more printing before you start everything yes it's doing like that that's a fantastic way to do it honestly thank you very much we already proud of that and as far as materials if the bed goes that hot and the nozzle gets that hot I mean you can print the standard or assortment of PLA abs PCAs a PT g TP use can you do flexibles in this yes because the do a dr extruder we are just developed it's very capable of flexible filaments dual-drive meaning it grabs it from both sides yes - and there is a three to one transmission also so it's very strong Oh could you if you had filament hanging from the sky could it look at the machine up yeah we wanted to try it out and make it on that YouTube yes is the shipping now is this available this seems like a wonderful package that someone might want yes we just started to selling these printers in this exhibition so pre-orders are already made and the production is underway in our factory that's great wait a minute I just saw something yes is this an example of what your hot end is sure sure but this is I'm curious so this is the nozzle yes and the nozzle goes all the way through the heater block yes and then this is the heat break the heat break and it it hasn't so the nozzle screws into the heat break yes oh oh okay so the heating the heat block is evenly can heat up the filament inside inside the nozzle there's no connection between the two material inside the heat block which can make some oozing or or some problems with the clogging or something I see so the heat is evenly applied just to the nozzle yes and then the nozzle touching the the heat break is it what material it's titanium okay so with the you're not getting any heat transference yes also there is narrowed down so the cold end of the hot end and the hot part of the hot end is not not interfering with each other that's really cool yes it is Wow well thank you for this tour I really appreciate it this looks like a fan to Batman she thank you am I get to try it sometime yes definitely you can leave you provide you one thank you we are out typically any 3d prints you get from a powder based system isn't going to be a finished product it's gonna look really cool but it's not a finished product what dimension offers as a service is a way that turns those powder prints into finished products and it's incredible what they do we spoke with Pia at their booth and she took us around and showed us some of the things that they're able to do with their service I was blown away I can't wait for you to see this one have a look hey Pia hi Joe welcome to the dimension booth well thank you it's a it's a it's a fantastic booth what do you do here at dye nanchang so we dimension we turn 3d printed raw parts into high value products so basically everything that comes after the printing step and we're not talking about the stuff that I do at home on consumer level machines right no we're talking about the industrial level and so really for powder bed fusion parts like SLS mjf FDM parts at a big scale okay was there anything you can show me that this has been done to so one of our biggest applications as I we're definitely I'm an area where fan yeah yeah so this is this is why there's so many so many eyewear frames already finished with our technology we believe there are over a million at this point really yes we kind of unlock this application with our surfacing and finishing technology yeah yeah sure so this is how to read printed right yes and then using your technology you were able to finish this and that makes it a finished product at this point right that's right the finishes is exquisite and the look is great so what is what happens what do you take this part and put it in a machine and your process does something yes for sure so when it comes out of the printer it's white obviously and it has a very rough surface what we now do is we remove the powder automate it and then we treat the surface with like a mechanical process so the polls are closed and the surface is more homogeneous and then also the dye penetrates in a better way and then our customers they can choose any color they like like from corporate colors to trend colors there will be blue blue blue will be fine I think this one is blue look at this there it is blue I don't know we might need to make a larger pair I'm gonna be rocking these for a little bit longer that's right we good yeah well what else can you show me here that your process has finished we got the first 3d printer to ever another more ever the first so Anna put that on the market in 2015 I guess and we also do the coloring here so they wanted back then and their corporate color glaze a gray and you see it really fits to the fabrics around it oh I see yeah very very very good colors on that well we got some other stuff behind us let's go take a look yeah what is this that we have here so yeah this will be an industrial application it's actually a scanner to scan your inventory look at this you can scan barcodes or QR codes with it and your process actually finished this and did it put the the words on it um so this one is afterwards I think it's okay yeah this looks neat and I would imagine that your technology is cool because obviously they're gonna want to brand their product with a color and thanks to your technology then they can do that easily yeah for sure for sure so we developed their orange tone and they have it here for example or at this case or even the chargers colored so it all fits together that's great it's a it's a complete product at this point there's more examples over here can we go take a look yeah let's go what are we looking at here so that's a new technology u.s. just launched here the show it's called fine detail resolution for even finer details show you this look at this it feels so good wait a minute this is printed yes it is it feels cool in my hand but the these details are crazy and it didn't come out pink from the EOS machine so how does your process maintain all of the detail in something so so small so the good thing about our process our dyeing process since it happens in a water bath it saves all detail and does not change the geometry so the parts I am thrown inside a basket the basket is fill up with water and then the dye stuff really penetrates apart you have different than spray spray painting no additional layer and every detail is saved and no additional layers it's so tiny like I can't comprehend and what's crazy too is once this was printed at some point I would have looked at it and said wow this is cool I know you've actually without adding anything to it you've made it pink that's right and it's neon pink it will even glow in the dark really yeah of course oh look at that you can actually there's a logo in it yes yes it sent us actually can you see that can you see us behind it well this is incredible and I love that I love that this is something that you can do to the material without changing its physical properties yeah I'm seeing one more thing over there though can we go take a look let's go that looks like a prosthetic there then your process was able to finish it yeah so this leg is scared down a bit but yeah it's a tailor-made piece and it's unique to the patient so the patient's can and then he gets his own leg prosthetic and yeah we dyed it so so look at the nice surface finish the surface finish is crazy it looks it doesn't look injection-molded because it has a matte finish on it that's fantastic yeah I know from our customer cutting out that some patient even go swimming with it really yeah it's totally fine so they go swimming and pedaling with it and it works so your process that dyes material isn't affected by the water no no so it's not the the dyes are not washable anymore after the process is done that's really cool well talking about the color though we have this next piece that is that is a hand but it's a very specific color right hello with our technology we are even capable of scan your skin tone for example we did this with a with the colleagues skin but in reality and the customer would do that as well so it's it's a surgical and it's a plastic surgeon and he uses that as kind of prototyping parts for his actually first actual work so he will show you okay this is how your hand will look like after I'm done well that's great because part of what makes this special is it's it's very customized for the user yes and being able to see a finished product or what something should look like in your own skin color I think is is a great way to do it so that's fantastic yeah and especially in the medical industry so the the own skin colors of the people help them to accept the aid better well finally that's a flexible piece over there is also nice so and you're able to finish flexible materials yes we did that with the system we just launched here the show and now we're finally finally capable and to also finish TPU and other flexible materials so that they really get a am sealed and washable surface which looked pretty similar to an injection molded surface very similar what was like you said it makes the the surface homogeneous and seals the pores and well it looks it looks incredible I didn't I mean I've used TPU before and printing on consumer and hobby level machines but you know there's I'm not finishing that I can't sand my TPU that's right but now I guess I can get a better TPU print yeah that's really cool yeah I want to say thank you very much I really appreciate the toy so visiting the Rays 3d booth that formed next was quite busy and there's a good reason for that because they were showing off their latest machine the e2 it's a bit of a departure from what they've offered in the past with a shorter Z but dual independent extruders they've also changed the user interface a little bit to make 3d printing with the Machine easier than ever before for those of any age and any skill level I really get the feeling you're gonna start to see the e2 in the education segment I stopped by the Rays 3d booth for a hot second have a look hey wow I got shocked hey this is the new raise II - I've heard about this machine and I know that most of the raise machines are big and tall and take up lots of room this one doesn't seem to be it almost it almost looks like a microwave oven oh this is cool I don't think anyone's around they must be busy I guess I get to play around okay it's got the same UI it looks like let's see okay it's got a great a great UI here and it looks like it's the same sort of touchscreen I can pause I can stop prints oh look at this look at this inside this is actually new for raise because it looks like it is a dual independent extruder and I guess it's going in duplication mode that's my guess it looks like it's printing the same thing on either side the oh jeez the extruders look new as well that's a new design oh oh and filament is on the side okay what happens if I open the door well look at that it pauses the print hold look at this ooh okay well no one's around maybe I can do this I'm gonna hit that and I'm gonna stop it look at it okay they'll lift up good okay I think look at this this is a removable flexible build plate oh this is fantastic I'm really glad that this machine has this and then put it back in oh it presents itself thank you okay it stopped Wow look at that oh there's a filter in the back and there's it opens up on top jeez it looks like the filters working too I can actually see some some dust and debris that it's collected and it hasn't shot out of the machine so that's important when we're talking about education and and different stem and steam programs because filtration is important all right wow this is actually okay this wasn't what I was expecting from race this is actually kind of neat I hope to get my hands on this pretty soon oh okay people are coming this was a lot of fun we'll see in a bit getting stronger prints is one of the tenants of industrial additive manufacturing and desktop metals latest offering the fiber 3d printer is aiming to make that easier than ever before the fiber uses continuous carbon fiber tape inlaid into 3d prints which makes them stronger than you would believe I was given a piece and I couldn't even flex it let alone bend it we spoke with Rick their CEO at their forum next booth have a look hey Rick hey how are you Joe I'm doing well and part of the reason I'm doing well is because there's this new machine that's next to you that desktop metal has I would love to hear more about it because it seems to be almost a game changing in nature it is it is an amazing machine for carbon fiber printing continuous carbon fiber printing continuous meaning there is a continuous carbon fiber strand we have the material it's the first machine that uses AFP tapes in a 3d printer and a desktop at an affordable price this tape is the same type of product that you put inside a jet and inside a jet engine component or a wing spar or a fuselage it's got the best material properties is called AFB tape usually it's millions of dollars to actually put AFB tape instead of product huge investment in capex of machines that do this once for airlines usage or is for aerospace or imagine that would be expended Mehreen or other applications and for the first time we're bringing it to the desktop or to an affordable you know machine that everybody can afford AFP tape is within this yes as well as what what is the surrounding material you can put peak pack nylon all sorts of all the good stuff all the good stuff yeah what's the price tag on something like this starts at thirty four ninety five a year so a year this is this is interesting because it's a it's like a hardware subscription hardware service you never struck with obsolete hardware you get service and software updates every couple weeks so it's a continually evolving machine has a tool changer so you'll eventually have metrology part inspection more materials lots of options so with the tool changer and I think I was mentioning this before we have the ability now with this machine then we can use not as expensive materials to prototype yeah and then using the same machine go back and do a AFP tape inlaid part that's a final part yeah although it's still very affordable it is thing yeah okay great great solution here I have this in my hand what is there are tiny little piece costing you a couple of pennies maybe a less than a buck okay we'll say less than a buck well and it doesn't even well here hold this for sure I just want to show I mean I am putting effort behind this a lot of it this is twice as strong as steel and half the way to aluminum whatever that is it's not much better than any in terms of mechanical properties much better than any other 3d printing process that's available on the market well this is important what you just mentioned a 3d printing process and so we have a world of makers who are in their garage or tinker's or hobbyists this is affordable this is not is gonna go in a basement this is exactly this is affordable but it's using a technique that everybody knows who's already doing this yeah it's a fantastic product yeah we should show you the parts yeah let's go see them excellent I'll follow you these are the parts right yeah okay let's start over here what what are these parts and why are they awesome different types of jigs and fixtures for manufacturing one of the really exciting things is the surface finish technology that we've implemented in this it looks it looks injection molded almost yeah for an it for an FTM part this is the surface finish that you get with our process which is really good hey the top layer has no layer lines like sectors it doesn't even look like it's been ironed per se it looks like a single part like a single piece and it's part of a special technology we've developed and these are all printed right o pieces here these are all jigs this is that looks like for a bicycle yeah that's a bicycle crank okay yeah you can print fiberglass continuous tape you could print carbon-fiber continuous tape you can print peak impact with chopped fiber so high temperature materials with chopped fiber they can withstand the continuous use up to 250 degrees C peak with chopped fiber yeah with AFP tape I mean that there's nothing stronger that's been printed at this point is badass yeah and these are all just some jigs that probably holds something what is that that is part of a race car the exhaust it used to be made out of steel because it gets hot it does and it's now a peak part with tape inside yeah it's pretty awesome it's super thin is very it's very stiff continuous operation of the 250 degrees C it's amazing it's in one of the BMW race teams in a really a vehicle I should probably inquire within because don't you drive one of those cars I can send you a picture I can arrange it yeah where'd you live far away from BMW what where do you live in this your Seattle okay if you come to Connecticut they'll race in Connecticut so deal and Connecticut Connecticut yeah I'll get you in the car so we've got parts here that are incredible but there's this other new machine over here that's producing some pretty neat stuff as well right yeah can we take a look absolutely let's do it fibre looks to be impressive and priced it's something that someone could afford to have a nap yeah this though this looks to be a little bit more expensive what is this machine and what's it doing so this is a shop system is the world's first by energetic system designed specifically for machine shops what makes that special I was so binder jetting I mean we have binder jetting and other machines sure this one though for a shop meaning well it's affordable and it has very very high resolution this does the highest resolution print engine ever put in a binder jet machine drops as small as one Pico liter and that's nothing in 1600 dpi which is 35 percent more than our closest competitor 5x redundancy which is 25% more than anybody else has ever done in a binder jet system and it can do a whole batch of parts in a very short amount of time it's incredible so you could stack the bed with parts we'll hit it go and then yeah you're gonna come back and then you Center your parts and you're done that's amazing what's that we're talking metal parts here that yeah metal parts all sorts of alloys stainless steels and canals you know all sorts of things high-performance materials copper so ok the shop system then give me an example of what a what one of your customers may be like a machine shop doing custom work for automobiles or maybe a motorcycle repair facility medical aerospace any type of high-end machine shop that would have lots of CNC machines this is a really productive way to prototype complex parts that would be incredibly difficult to machine I see so we're we're utilizing than 3d printing to make geometries that would otherwise be impossible they'll be cheaper to make this way than machining they'll be much faster to make this way than machining interesting strong yeah it's the same the same Alice in metals so actually if we show you some parts like you can actually see that you need many setups to do something with five axis and it would be so slow compared to what you can do in a day with this system so it would totally change the economics of the modern machine shop well and we're talking about loading up the bed so we're not just having a layer of parts you can produce parts as a machine shop cost-effectively here and go head-to-head with CNC you may need to retouch different areas but then you end up with like incredible geometry that would have been impossible to make otherwise it's awesome that's really cool like I want to thank you for this tour I really see a fantastic fantastic back in 2016 I was one of the fortunate few that got to test the Sigma a new entry into these 3d printers that we use that used dual independent extruders in a large build volume that utilized an a4 sized build plate and went through a few iterations and we ended up finally with an upgrade to the sigmax but that's not where they stopped BC n 3d just released the epsilon which is borrowing some of the familiar features from the sigmax but upgrading it in ways that well you will just have to see to believe we chatted with Eric at the booth have a look Eric hey how you doing finally quite busy I would imagine yeah a lot of people in the show a lot of people but a lot of people because they're interested in your new machine that's right there yeah that's why we are here I mean with a big stuff to introduce the people the the new epsilon so yeah a lot of attraction for the new printer the feedback so far so far is being good so yeah quite happy that's great well one of the things I first mentioned we're standing next to it and it's printing but I can't hear it at all now I'm gonna ask you can we open it up because the enclosure might be canceling some of that noise right yeah sure actually let's open it there's a safety post feature disabled because everybody's opening the door yeah we don't wanna be safe at for next yeah you can check the noise everyone actually we're printing with polypropylene here which having the the build chamber closed helps but it's a neat machine it looks larger than the sigmax how much has changed since the Sigma X well many many things have have changed here obviously DB volume it's twice the the ball volume of the of the Sigma X we have included as well be the closed built chamber that helps a lot with technical materials we're focusing on real applications here with you know technical materials like ABS P P P a carbon and glass reinforced materials so that's basic it's not actively heated correct not actively we are warming up the environment with he generated by the heated bit so we can create the right atmosphere you know we stable over it over the time it's when you open the door I can feel it a little bit yeah there's a little bit eat there yeah of course and for materials you're saying we're not we're not over it's 300 C ish yeah all right okay so we are not in the in the Big Bang range yet but you can print them in up to 300 degrees a lot of technical materials for real-life applications I think a lot of people for this sort of machine I would imagine would be looking at the the nylons or the the fiber reinforced nylons or a sa materials stuff like that yeah this is one of the major applications I mean I've been talking to a lot of people during the show and they have some sort of experience in 3d printing but they always stick to PLA because every time they try to print something different they struggle say I keep with PLA we want to change that perception of you know printing with technical materials is difficult you can do it if you have the proper conditions and the proper ecosystem I like what you're saying there because like I put it with a lot of PLA it's a wonderful material really easy to print with but making non PLA materials easier to print right off the bat I think is really going to expand the range of what people can make yeah of course that's that's a goal we kind of do it alone we need a good partner so that's why we're working closely with M CPP a group of Mitsubishi chemical and BASF so we have the good combination of profiles software printer so yeah it's a good starting point of course more materials will come in the in the coming months so let's let's receive feedback and and see which materials really make sense for this printer you mentioned software is it still PC and Kira is that correct yes right we're still using BC and three Kira we have our release coming out in the in the following weeks that is including all the new features cloud-related so now the user put in Kira BC entry could login and send the job files directly to the to the printer select which printer in case they have more than one and also you can check from any mobile device or from anywhere from the browser you can see the status of V of the printers you can see here the vision through the cloud this is something we are putting a lot of efforts on developing because we really believe the de cloud is like the future to provide a good service I would you know platform to to go for the information to receive recommendations from our part yeah this is the starting point with this though a cloud-based solution we're talking about now like almost a service bureau management system where people could have multiple epsilon machines that's inner bureau and printing for people that helps of course that's area also we have detected that most of our customers just have one printer so the idea is we want the we want them to set up teams with a shared resource the the printer so multiple users can log in and with the same printer can arrange the jobs and you know organize all that printing stuff that is cute sometimes for you know professional applications right well this is that's that's an educational use case right we have maybe one machine in a classroom with many students for example for example or for us as engineers actually we're using these are the at the office we have the printing lab and all of us have a user and we can send the the job files so the the lab managers can can can print that everything from from the cloud it's easier to to manage well that's great it looks like you have quite a machine on your hands can we dive deep into any of the technical details yeah of course I see you some stuff back there can you go back Joe it looks like you have a display here of some of the changes that you've made to the epsilon right right let's go over these first it looks like the heated bed is different yeah definitely we have changed first of all the source of the heat we are using now a silicone pad so we can reach 120 degrees in less than 10 minutes also we have an aluminum plate to evenly distribute that heat so we have no called corners it's oh that's good yeah that's super important especially with Technic materials like ABS so we have no longer a magnetic bed you can see the the not just here - I like those noxious yeah make you taking it out real easily honey user experience is always important so only things you've always had the little markings on the dials to know how far to turn yeah that's really handy honestly otherwise you you get those with you know some some use that you know how much it's 35 degrees it's like what you have to you know take the calculator yeah so z-axis here right we have changed the the key mechanical components that we have thicker rods better well I mean we're using top notch components for all the decadence a stepper motor that can handle higher axial loads so stiffer design as well it's important so it's one motor and it still cantilever yeah and I mean those those bronze are huge and the motor can still handle a full load of course also we have CNC machine blocks to properly assemble and also to bring some more sturdiness to the to the to the frame because it now it's cute it's aluminum frame but still it needs to be reinforced so this blocks helps a lot also it's convenient for assembling after cell service it's it's a good improvement I like this a lot because before and then I know in the the sigmax this was not a solid piece yeah and that is a solid piece attached to the aluminum frame is really going to make things rigid yeah over here okay so about the electrics we have the same motion board that in the epsilon I'm sorry than in the Sigma and Sigma acts but the point is now we have a computer embedded on the on the epsilon so really embedded Linux yes right we have a distribution of Linux we are working with cute as well so we use this a lot the the development of the cloud solutions and all the embedded so for future products that's also very convenient so we can change the the module and have more power with a very low investment on development that's great and yeah I mean having a computer inside open the door of multiple features multi-language over-the-air updates with something like that you can now develop features that you may not even be thinking about right now it's very very future proof it opens the door to new stuff we are always open to receive feedback and we try to understand what customers are really needing I mean we don't want to develop stuff because of developing we want to solve problem so in case some some customer have a good idea please let us know well this is the last one on the table here this is your x-axis right again the same with the with the z axis we have improved all the mechanical components we are here using genuine hewing linear guides we have improved the sturdiness of the of the super sembly now it's easier to assemble as well so yeah it's important to have good mechanical components if you are working in our work environment we can reach up to sixty degrees so we have invested on me on all the mechanical stuff right with I mean with such a build volume on this machine and especially with the enclosure keeping it nice and warm on the inside I mean you know you have to make sure all of your internal components can perform and it looks like you've made some upgrades that really ensure that yeah definitely super important reliability is I mean its basic if you don't have a reliable machine you're done so we have invested on on components and making sure that everything can you can run run smoothly this is great thanks for the tour and I wish you the best of luck with your new machine thank you very much we got the chance to stop by and see Loctite and what do you think of Loctite you think of a company that makes stuff that adheres things to other things but Loctite is now entering the additive manufacturing category with some very specific resins and accessories for post-processing your prints we chatted with Oscar at the booth have a look hey how's good hey Joe what's your title here at Loctite I am the head of 3d printing post-processing global in local tights in Hanko well when I think of Loctite I don't think of 3d printing I think of adhesives and stuff that holds stuff together so what does walks like doing in 3d printing that's correct so we have many many years of experience in industries all around whatever you see all around in the the car that you use the phone that you phone call or everything that used in your kitchen we have some lasers inside surface treatment chemicals or sealants now having that expertise now we are entering into additives works place creating all the latest technological DLP resins that we print high technological parts that can go into your manufacturing much faster wait wait so you're talking about photo polymers things that are residents that are cured right that's correct and these are high strength so what we have is for example in this one is the latest F HD materials that we can print that we have the flame retardancy and you'll night for a froot with this material we were gonna change the day the way things are done in them in them in this editing market so this is a material that you provide for people who are making the products correct correct and for example aerospace automotive rail these are all the verticals that we'll be seeing our materials printed in the future with materials I mean that's that's great but Loctite knows adhesives as well do you have an adhesive solution for additives walk together I'll follow you Oscar you talked about your resin that is has a fire retardant agent in it but what about the cleaning solution for those resin prints well that's a very important topic because every resin printing operation has a cleaning session afterwards and today we see a lot of flammable solvents are used and you know what flammable means room-temperature flammable oh I know and when we think about the diavik printers around the world it's a safety issue health issue it's volatile people are inhaling that so and people can develop a sensitivity to it as well if inhale in time you get some health issues so what we did we developed a new non flammable cleaner that is a flash point of about 75 Celsius to get this into this market that's great to hear and it's here right yeah that is the war equipment so we have two stages the one on the left let me open it rise up here that's the cleaning section and this is in the washing station why do we have two stages because we clean here first with our non-flammable cleaners see this is Loctite 3d printing cleaner see and then we move the parts into this basket where we rinse it yep yeah yeah a two-stage eye I know about the two-stage cleaning so when we build this two into two stages you can also build your cleaning process much faster and you don't get in touch with the cleaner that's all the idea that's cool and as is this and the cleaner available correct right now available US and Europe customers DFP and users can reach to us and we will be happy to support them what do we have here so this is the universal bounder you know Loctite has Universal like Universal Universal bounder has thousands of phases if he put those erasers into this hole people will hate us initially now with just one adhesive we can bond about 90% of the materials that are printed and polymer additive manufacturing we're talking PLA ABS all of them except polypropylene pool propylene is a difficult one but yeah we have a solution for that also in this kit you have a primer an innocent founder that we can't even bounce polypropylene and polyethylene really that's correct people also say the same feedback like ok they don't believe us they bring their parts here and we bond them wow that's incredible because I mean we're I usually deal with non industrial materials but when you're doing with that you know peek and pack and P I the the solutions that are needed are well they're here yeah so in this show we brought here 638 Universal bounders these are the only ones left down whoever comes we are giving one piece free and that's that's all fun and they are making their Loctite moments we call this log back moments okay and because with this small adhesion they can fix most of their problems and if they cannot they know where to find the solution as well that's fantastic well Oscar thanks for the tour I really appreciate it thank you very much I appreciate it as well thank you hey you made it this far thanks because I do have something to say we talk about 3d printing and normal when we talk about it we talk about the consumer based and the hobby based machines but the industrial side of 3d printing and additive manufacturing is this amazing segment with thousands and thousands of people doing amazing things if you've ever wanted to quote-unquote work in 3d printing you should definitely look into the industrial side of additive manufacturing there's some amazing things going on I got to see a lot of it and not all of it of course we were able to show on this episode but we did our best and I hope you enjoyed it we do have some outtakes and I'll put those in my patreon you can actually find a link down in the description sean has a patreon as well and he's had requests for gear so if you're interested in the gear we took or how we filmed certain segments he's gonna break it down on his patreon that'll be down below as well don't forget to hug each other more - love you all as always high-five you", "y4LwDpB-SWo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] you", "jlB2QV5wVxg": "blueprints for 3d printed ar-15 semi-automatic rifles have been downloaded more than 2500 times ghost guns and the technology needed to make them a 3d printer and access to the internet anybody could purchase one of these on the internet this is not regulated these guns require no background checks they're undetectable they're untraceable i mean once it's out there it it's out there isn't it gun is easy to make in europe [Music] [ __ ] this dystopia we are [ __ ] [Music] uncontrolled [Music] so right now we're somewhere in western europe i can't exactly say where we are because the guy we've come here to me has been secretly 3d printing his own assault rifles now obviously that is completely illegal here gun laws are very strict and if this guy is caught manufacturing untraceable firearms which is what he's doing he's going to get sent to prison for a very long time i've spoken to him about this he's aware of the risks and he's agreed to meet with us anyway so hopefully he's going to explain to us why he's 3d printing his own guns and to tell us about the network he's a part of that is helping him do this the network is called deterrence dispense their global all over the world and basically their main aim is to make impossible for authorities anywhere to stop people having a gun this is the terence dispensed there were decentralized 3d printed gun network their gun designs are freely available online and have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times according to their spokesman deterrence dispensed has been incorrectly characterized online as either a far-right organization or a political anarchist group then neither in fact they don't have any specific ideology other than unconditional free speech and the absolute freedom for anyone to own a firearm deterrents dispense the brazenly spreading these ideas and their downloadable gun instructions all over the world there are thousands in their community mostly based in america where 3d printed guns are legal however these guns have spread to western europe 3d printed semi-automatic rifles that take nine millimeter rounds they're robust they don't blow up in your hands and they're untraceable they can be made in someone's bedroom at popular front we managed to get access to the founder of the terrance dispensed a man known as jay stark he lives and operates in europe jay stark agreed to meet us on the condition that we protect his identity and exact location which which parts are plastic 3d printed and which parts are metal print it print it print it print it printed printed that's basically what you see from this side so about 80 of it is 3d printed you can say that yeah yeah so firstly explain to us why are you doing this why are you 3d printing untraceable firearms i'm of the opinion that to bear firearms is a human right the government or the entity that has the rule over you has an executive force the police the military their firearms to be able to escape that uh that um injustice they need to have the same force on the individual level as the executive force of the government entity that is ruling over them so this is my ideological reasoning and then a different reason why i am risking everything to be able to own and bear foreign arms is because i am extremely enthusiastic about them they are a hobby of mine i'm extremely interested about this history the technology and there are certain circumstances in my life which are unfortunate which make living kind of painful and sometimes i do not have anything to look forward to most people usually have something that they that they cannot risk stuff for but with me i have nothing to lose so that's why it is very easy for me to to risk everything and to be able to accept the risk to die at any time basically so so you just said then like you know you're willing to die for this like really like if the police come in here now they raided you you got caught somehow like what you're not gonna you're gonna fight them or what basically yes they're free or die these are empty words maybe explain to us how you got into 3d printed guns like what you're doing is very technical there's a long history of 3d printing guns right in america for example we're not in america how did this tool start for you so as you probably might know a 3d printed pistol was shown to the world in 2013 by an entity called defense distributed it's basically a company that was founded by cody wilson an american from texas who was studying for a law degree i saw this and i was intrigued i was living in a country i'm still living in a country where it's even impossible for you to repair farms and so if i cannot buy it through a legal or illegal way i need to build it myself and so this liberator pistol picked my interest and then at one point i found out about how 3d printers became increasingly more cheap and i bought my first 3d printer and at the same time defense distributed after they released this liberator pistol ran some sort of web page where you were able to download various files for various gun designs and also 3d printed designs when i looked at the files i saw that everything was incomplete and the parts that were modeled and the technical data that was uh available there was in these files was absolutely solidly modeled was absolutely not true to the real world so it would be basically useless to try to use those fans to produce any firearm what i did then is i wanted to start a community that was enthusiastic about this topic as as much as me and so i posted discord invite links into the comment sections of each of those various files on that webpage the idea was to build a community so what i wanted is an effective farm a firearm which i'm able to defend myself against any assailants which i can be offensive with if there's any tyrant that wants to dictate his tyrannical wars upon me and so i was able to start at community i invited everyone and my goal was to to build this community who was enthusiastic about the topic as much as me i had no technical background like i didn't study any engineering i never used a 3d printer and so from that moment on i needed to teach myself how to use cats of prayer what i did was i also went on to a recruiting hunt we ended up with a core group of a couple dozen people who had all sorts of knowledge and so me and ivan basically then had this goal of making an ar-15 assembly happen so day and night day and night day and night so you said before you had no technical expertise you didn't know how to do this beforehand how did you then teach yourself to use the 3d printed software the how did you get the printer you eventually ended up making your own like lower for the rifle how did you do that the most useful tool for this in general was the internet the internet enabled me to do all this i was able to learn all the information that i needed through youtube through wikipedia through various forums and through chatting with other enthusiasts there's one thing that you really have to take in mind here motivation all this information is available out there but why isn't everybody doing it because they don't have the motivation to do all that i have a fierce motivation to do all that because of the reasons that i told you already okay so let's go back to deterrence dispense now right you're saying you started this new group you did something quite different so when cody wilson was doing his thing it was all very like centralized he was kind of controlling it he had the files which you say weren't even any good the difference of what you're doing is it's completely decentralized right you're putting everything out there for free you're inviting other people to do it and i've seen you guys saying online you know we're killing gun control we're pissing on the grave of gun control um why did you decide like yeah this has got to be decentralized we want to put it to everybody it absolutely makes sense to not be a single entity that is bound to a certain platform and can be destroyed at any time the wonderful thing about our work is that we are mostly anonymous and we are sharing our knowledge and our information so if somebody goes down the other one continues working you just have future peer networks you have this globalized internet infrastructure where files cannot be censored if they are sensitive one place they pull up at another and that's that's true also for us as individuals in terms of working for the cause if something unfortunate happens to one individual the other individual will take his place and so on and so forth it's a hydra that you cannot completely kill because as you cut off one hat the other head pops up we are impossible to stop and tell us about the uh the uh fgc9 this is this this rifle here right this one that you've constructed yourself um what's so special about this the fgc9 [ __ ] gun control 9-millimeter is a firearm that is truly effective for self-defense being offensive and at the same time it's a firearm that you're able to build yourself as an average so with no specialized tooling with no special knowledge and the ammunition the bullets where do they come from i make the cartridges i basically assemble them can you show us sure um so explain to us what are you doing here why do you have to make your own ammunition basically to get around europe you even need to make it yourself or buy it in england buying it illegally is extremely difficult it's extremely difficult to get a hold of someone who won't scam you who isn't the law enforcement so you have to make the ammo yourself and so to do that i have this priming tool this round here goes in this 3d printed rifle exactly now you could do something with this one if you wanted to to make an fgc9 you would need around i'd say one and a half weeks or two weeks that quick yes whilst at his workshop jay stuck also showed us how he designed the fgc 9 on his computer we can't show everything but this was essentially the core of the terrence [Music] dispensed my ideology is shaped in such a way where i think this should be the reality for everyone i have the opinion that freedom and liberty are more important in security that's why i'm risking that we have a little bit less of security um program of freedom i'm extremely peaceful so we've just got back from jay stark's workshop where he 3d prints his guns what he's doing is incredible on one level but also unbelievably dangerous he's not just building these guns for himself he's telling other people everybody should do this he's trying to encourage other people to do it could cause a lot of mayhem honestly the next day jay stark sent us a set of coordinates and told us to meet him there as soon as possible he arrived with two fgc nines in a bag and led us into a forest [Music] on route jay stark told us more about the reach of the terrence dispensed our group a decentralized route is very diverse has lots of international members and like i already said when we push our design files up there it's not only for among our group but for everybody else outside of our group everybody around the world man we try to express the truth man spread the message um ideologically other than the idea that everyone should own firearms do you know like politically right there come and take it you know do you know politically what kind of people are in your group i mean we roll this way so our group stands for two things freedom of speech and the right to bear arms and people who would try to infringe these rights from a certain group from a certain ethnic group or from a certain political group these people we do not like we kind of don't like extremists because they usually start a fierce conversation of debate we don't like that we don't like to we actually like to discuss uh actual designing firearms actually advancing the cost actually focusing on the actual proper things and all of our politics but in general we do not like racists we do not like xenophobes we just like people who just are for the cause of the right to bear arms and for freedom of speech right and do you do some kind of vetting process or something so basically we let everybody in but if they act up you kick them so just just hypothetically here bear with me imagine say like imagine somehow a member of isis just entered your group they didn't speak about politics they didn't say anything but they added say say they were like oh we're helping you build the rifles i mean what you would just let them stay we have no idea that the extremists or races or isis how the [ __ ] would we tell if they're actually that like if they never talk about politics if they never show any indication of xenophobia or being zealots how the [ __ ] are we supposed to to to know that we have to kick them out but if they do show through that they are extremists racist is on the terrorists then we would kick them out and immediately uh basically stop all all work and uh all uh communication with them we don't think it's dangerous to not already know like there might be those guys might be in your group you have no idea what you have to realize this the advancement of technology has no politics at the ads on bond chemical weapons diy rocket launchers ieds whatever if it's bad or good technology it has no politics so i don't really see the point in your question so you don't really care about who's in or who's not we do care we do care but you i mean if you don't know then it's like that's secret everybody can hide behind a certain persona and they can stay hidden for a long time with their real identity and only after they reveal themselves you can actually take action you were saying like you don't want extremists some people will see this and they'll think you're an extremist maybe not an islamic extremist maybe not right wing or whatever but they would think you're some kind of gun extremist i mean what would you say to that so if other people see us as extremists that's okay but what i can tell is we do not want harm to anyone we want everyone to live peacefully amongst each other and we want people to have the freedom of speech the right to bear arms if that's too politically extreme for you [ __ ] yourself all your rights could go away like that and that's why i need to wake people up and we need to go onto onto the offensive because people are are asleep on this issue they are not realizing what's what's at stake here that gun control is getting stricter and stricter and governments are getting more tyrannical more tyrannical china's already a [ __ ] living nightmare we gotta go on the offensive man time is running out it's an extreme dystopia out there should we keep going let's go [Music] apparently it was time to test-fire the [Music] rifles [Music] i'm on fire we're very hot right how do you feel fire in that now shooting it yourself out in the open instead of just the basement or something that's a really cool thing to do and smelling the gunpowder it didn't blow your hands off do you know what is weird though for me to see how we went from your little workshop 3d printed it's gone from the workshop seeing you crimp the ammo and now seeing it fired it's almost like wow it's real that would just kill someone that could kill them peppered with casings yep just like that yeah yeah just like that the only way i can guarantee my rights yeah is by being able to protect myself against others who want to take my right away it's completely untraceable right there's no serial numbers no nothing no cereal numbers no nothing yeah you could attack someone with that as well though i could and also protect myself yeah yeah i could protect myself sure or attack great power comes great responsibility and it is unfair to take away the people are because you think they do not are worthy of having the power do you think you have a responsibility for who owns the gun i have a responsibility to make sure everybody has the option to be able to get a gun what about the way they use it the way they use it is up to on them and once they did harm then they forfeited their their belonging in the peaceful community there are extremists out there who are saying extremist phrases and they're they are inciting hate they should have freedom of speech if i do not fight for the freedom of speech of somebody else who i do not agree with then the next day somebody else will take away my freedom of speech that's the same idea with the right to bear arms right you can't kill someone with freedom of speech you can kill someone with that it's not about killing somebody it's about you yourself forgetting you yourself and protecting yourself from tyranny just look at you girls in china that's all what's happening to them nobody's helping them nobody does [ __ ] you know what would help them if they were armed that there would be a deterrent that's what you do there's a stance [ __ ] all these governments who take away the right to barons [ __ ] all of those [ __ ] the surveillance state [ __ ] this dystopia we are [ __ ] uncontrolled and by that we are [ __ ] authoritarian regimes likelihood a police officer is going to see this when it goes out it's probably going to make a splash i mean they're going to want to find you what what's your what's your thoughts on that they're just doing a dirty work with the politicians but if they want to take my life away if they want to take my rights away i'm not going to go down without any fight and would you say you're would you say you're encouraging people like you want other people to do that's what you're doing absolutely absolutely just look at the world man you don't think that's like reckless at all no no if the government actually went extremely tyrannical look at [ __ ] afghanistan look at [ __ ] vietnam look how it was you only need [ __ ] ak some ammo and sheer will to [ __ ] take down the machine and you see what i'm talking about come on give me better arguments man no right but okay here's a better argument imagine if someone 3d printed what you've created and then shot someone you love for no reason that is something that i have to accept really it's a risk that i have to accept [ __ ] that [ __ ] it's about universal rights just like saying because somebody uh somebody cussed me out and my feelings are hurt the freedom of speech exists it's not the same as that there's killing killing is the ultimate act of taking some from freedom of speech this is not speech it is to protect my freedom of speech do you not understand how this all principle works rights you need something to protect these rights without the ability to protect yourself and without to fight against some tyrannical force how the [ __ ] are you gonna keep your [ __ ] rights man think about it that's the way you see it huh i mean that's what it is just look at the [ __ ] world everything else i mean to you you do this all the time but to me it's shocking you know it's been made so easily really i mean now i know you're very like you're very good technically but with your instructions i could learn this anyone can learn this show could learn this in a matter of weeks components you can buy everywhere else online and you can make your own ammo even in this [ __ ] dystopia of europe and the gun you can make anyway i mean not bad is easy to make in europe [Music] live free or [ __ ] die [Music] jay stuck is by far one of the most dangerous people i've ever met and his extremist firearms ideology is spreading we know for a fact that he's not the only one building so-called downloadable guns in europe with the help of the terrance dispensed meanwhile authorities seem to have little understanding of how advanced 3d printed guns have gotten as we've seen they shoot rapidly and they don't explode when firing as jay stark says deterrence dispense technology could be used to combat authoritarian regimes but it could also easily fall into the wrong hands and if it does many innocent people could die [Music] i mean once it's out there it's out there it's out there isn't it itself you", "rfP0yNb9CCE": "[Music] hello zebraherd welcome back to super mario 3d world last episode we completed world flower and unlocked what the game is said now to be the final world of the game i guess single can't be world star because we've already had world star whoa oh it's so golden i love it so what world is this this is world crown all right so it took us a long time to get here getting through world one through six um and then we did world seven which was world castle then we had to eat which is world bowser then world star mushroom and flower and now finally our world crown and this one looks a lot more uh compact there isn't too much going on with this one um i'm sure these levels are going to be notably difficult let's start with a stamp though sure so what's going on with this i'm just going to grab it real quick this is oh it's a little 8-bit mario that's cool so i don't think there's like too many more stamps left to get i think there might be two stamps left that aren't like completing every level with every character so we'll see what that's about soon enough but i don't know which order to do these in and i think the character were supposed to be playing nexus toad i think we're just gonna play whatever character is going to be easiest for the task but it looks like we're supposed to start with world crown crown but i think this is like the final level though champions road i've heard a lot of people talk about that one i think we already seen that for last um let's go with some like typical action here we'll do the uh mystery box first oh my gosh that's a lot of stars all right we'll try our best at this one um oh no it's just a peach all right sure mystery house marathon all right i'll give my best shot uh there we go there you go i guess i'm supposed to be taking them all out i'm sure the goal is going to vary for each one how many stars are there there's 30. okay oh boy and i wonder if some of these because it sort of looks familiar i wonder if this is okay there you go um i wonder if some of these are like callbacks or previous ones oh i see i need to pick you up three on the button there you go this is not gonna be easy is it because if we make one mistake we're gonna do the whole thing over don't we all right uh oh fire flower sweet all right go go go go got it wait i gotta get the star too oh my gosh it's always the scary part right what's next okay uh the whole floor is rotating this is where peaches ow floaty jump can definitely be useful there we go there we go so five stars down 25 more to go oh my goodness luckily there's no timer for getting to the box because that was really hard to reach um i guess i'm supposed to have a power up at this point it's a very good thing i was able to wait wait just get this target just get the star i mean obviously i guess i could have done that without a power up oh no crown is there like any kind of uh hidden crate or hidden box not looking like that okay defeat all the goombas this is really easy to catch soon that one was super duper easy more like that please uh oh boy come on come on come on yeah we got it that was a little bit of a scary throw there oh my um no the cat suit i really needed to keep that um okay which one of these there it is uh of course it's the last one wait oh no i really not selling up didn't i okay we'll get to keep the cat suit that's good it's whatever powers we go into it with we do get to keep i'm glad to see that um so i gotta go and do all of it uh again it's actually a really big problem that i just messed up that maybe let's try again maybe sure i'm gonna try again because i want to keep the cat soon okay so it was this one last time and it's that one this time and luckily with the catsuit that makes it significantly easier what i do want to see for this that i know the next time if i just need to complete it easily okay i don't even need the trampoline all right good to know um what do we do here oh it's invisible oh it's invisible um i'm gonna run all the time i might at least uh come on come on that was close all right uh oh ice skating all right be careful these guys they are definitely getting away so i need to definitely be scouting out exactly where they're gonna be ahead of time don't want to go straight off the edge there all right what's going on with this one i already got a cat suit but i'll take this oh boy come on let him the button but now the hard part no wait wait wait oh i was just touching it ah darn i can see how this might take a lot of tries but we'll keep at it we're almost there okay i was able to get it i feel like if you get this you go to the your way to get that cat suit it's like just barely possible to do that one in time so i don't know if i exactly recommend that but grabbing it afterwards seems like a great idea okay so we're just supposed to climb with this thing this is where the cat's suit once again it's very useful trying to get to the top of this with a couch suit seems not very possible so some of these times you just have to keep the power up one two one two there it is there it is there it is we got it we got it easy all right then let's keep it moving okay i definitely remember this one but it like wasn't nighttime in one of the previous star levels i feel like maybe if not anything else that's maybe like a little bit more difficult if the timing's more concise oh my what do we do here okay so i need to climb i don't know that way oh no i got i got it there it is it was sort of hard to sort of figure out which way i should go there that seemed to be the right way what do i do here oh there's money you got to catch the bunny gotcha phew that's a scary one okay so we're more or less i think we need one more to be technically halfway through and there's an odd number of no there's 30 of them right there's 30. okay so oh yes we already reached halfway nevermind i thought it was 25 for a moment i was like wait this is just coins i don't need that um no no no come on wait jump peach wait once again ah the hairs to our little cat paws were just barely grazing it it wasn't enough all right this is the one i messed up last time obviously not going for the coins i'll see a lot more all the coins go away after you get the level done this is not fair i deserve some coins for that all right then okay this is certainly much easier with a cat suit i'll tell you that much try to keep a cat suit for that one okay um i had to guess if these are gonna make extensions who almost messed that one up actually all right go go go go wow it was on zero seconds very scary um i don't know what's happening with this one i'm just trying to move i'm just trying to move this is scary it's intense every single time especially since like we don't know what's next no wait wait wait wait come on i was almost there oh there's no way now there's no way oh that is so lame so lame all right i guess i gotta do it again but now i know what's going on with that one okay so i switched some mario for this one oh gosh there we go there we go oh close one because when i was trying to do that is peach i kept floating and it just like wasn't what i needed to do um oh my uh do okay um i don't know what we're doing with this exploding that in this button that worked that was a scary one but we're playing as mario now just because he has like the most reliable oh um oh no uh problems there we go we got it we got it wait why why why didn't i excuse me [Music] i'm confused okay now that i know i'm supposed to also destroy these hopefully this gets a lot easier i don't know how you do that without the capsule maybe you could just jump on it but there's the start of the way five more to go we can do it right okay we gotta move we gotta move gotta move i hope the goal wasn't to get rid of all the prana plans because i'm already out of luck with that one nope we got it we got it don't fall if we follow or doom it does count as a death um was this a mistake we're about to find out no it wasn't wait what is that three more to go come on keep going uh run around jumping over the spike land on his head thank you second last one coming up oh boom boom an entire boss fight in seven seconds there's no way okay it was just one hit just one hit oh my gosh one more oh look at this i'm gonna stay up oh this is gonna be an easy one would you look at that oh thank you all the sprinkles are here to cheer us on we did it 30 green stars all in one level that was quite the marathon indeed very difficult we get ourselves a star so there's only like one more non complete all levels kind of stamp it looked like it was like this little of a cat mario we'll see i'm guessing we get that one by probably getting every green star or something either way 372 green stars in total now we're not tackling that last level yet instead i'm going over this way in order to tackle the last captain toad level captain toad's fiery finale with five green stars to get and a stamp oh well maybe not then maybe this is n all right let's give it our best shot time for adventure he's so cute whoa looks dangerous be careful captain toad [Music] okay so there is a time limit for these levels but it's always worth taking our time so these platforms sort of go up and down which is good i think i want to rush over here real quick this prana plant firing [ __ ] lava or fire at me not appreciated oh let's move quick let's move quick let's move quick that was almost not quick enough uh yeah over here over here no wait okay i got a little a little antsy there i was just worried about the fireballs being shot at me i think we got the idea that um i'm just gonna grab that one real fast because we already know now supposed to go down here go over this way and this gives me a chance to sort of look around it looks like there's something i can click over that way i guess it's sort of like what our goal is right now don't hit me with that please thank you um well first off let's grab that and then go back this way and then okay so we can raise that and platform suppose well hmm okay so let's uh first do that oh my and captain dude can only fall like straight down it's not really too much worth it to uh try to like make a jump over that way or something it's not going to work out this prana plant is what really makes this level difficult okay and there's another one for us don't hop down there just yet i don't know if this stays up forever which is the scary part luckily his fireball sort of just hitting the uh okay you can't touch a wall it's covered in lava that was just in the guardrail go back down and then go back up there we go much better so here's another green star go fast go fast oh my oh so how do i get past this guy then um i'm not entirely oh oh here we go ow oh he got me finally gummies and trying sorry to do that okay we'll get the stamp for this and then i guess i just oh let's grab all of our coins then i get my revenge see ya all right there we go i wasn't too bad but definitely a bit treacherous at times awesome really happy to get that done the final captain toad level but if you want to see more captaincy levels if you haven't checked out my captain to a treasure tracker series oh okay so there was the captain toad stamp i noticed that was a thing bye but yeah i played through the entirety captain to treasure tracker and it's additional dlc on the switch uh so if you want to see more captain toad action that's a really fun series we did a couple years ago um but we have the final level now as far as i can tell if we look at the level list yeah it has to be all right world crown crown champions road who else to play this with mar but then with mario we'll see how this goes if it doesn't go so well i might try different characters to sort of see what's best but we got to use mar it's it's super mario 3d world right it's only fitting we got all these people cheering us on i don't know like like i've said before i haven't heard too much about this game before playing it but one thing i had always heard is that this level is like unspeakably difficult let's do it on the first try i'll try my best i mean with how much we struggled with the uh the mystery box i'm not super confident oh my um i'm glad that hurts him but i'm guessing they're not going to give us any kind of free stuff here no free power-ups or anything i haven't seen any green stars yet though oh my okay i must have the timing there probably should have stopped and listened for it it's no power-ups now i'm just normal mario nice and simple right who needs power-ups we can do this with just normal mario okay uh that's not good but you know what i'm expecting to sort of die a lot it's okay let's jump over him [Music] it's the hardest level in the game why wouldn't we expect to die a lot but each time we can sort of get a little more comfortable with it two one two one two one two one two one oh my oh we hit the corner of it that one's actually a little tricky to get to the right angle there but we made a lot farther that time but yeah just like what a journey it's been getting into this point the scheme has not been easy it's been a challenging ride the whole way through oh no whoa about what i meant to do yikes that was much better i'm trying to use the momentum to my advantage i got hit at the fire bros again though oh you go right through it if you do that okay so i got a little bit farther i can see in the distance look there's a comic there that's a little bit concerning and that's where i'm like starting to think if there's gonna be this many enemies and you know keeping a power up isn't really going to be in the question oh my i'm thinking the best character to do this with and i'll wait until i sort of get a little bit farther because i have 81 lines we have a lot of time to experiment here um i'm thinking rosalina is going to be our best character because she has her spin move which gives us a little bit more control over our jump but also gives us sibo to take out enemies much much easier so i think that's what we're going to be trying here soon enough but i really want to see how far i can get with mario in these couple of tries i'm just trying to avoid the fire bros i've noticed that if you don't have to take out an enemy in this level just don't like just dodge them no okay that almost must be a thought like if i just oh but usually i go in between them and it's all cool and stuff you don't have to worry about taking them out and it's much faster i'm sure so i'm gonna try one more time with mario here and we'll see how it goes [Music] okay okay that's good that's good there's the green star all right we got it very good so what's going on over here with the comics rosalina has been going great so far i do have a a cat power-up on reserve i'm really trying to save it until it's okay clearly evident that i need it and that's enough evidence for me uh whoa okay i don't like all these following platforms i'll tell you that much what's going on here okay now i got these rollers oh i guess i'll take this i mean oh yeah for these fuzzies i suppose i still almost got hit and i did okay um whoa i actually wasn't ready for the spin oh that hurts and i don't the cat suit again it's just like you get a little bit farther after about another 15 or so tries and then you gotta do it all over again okay well i'll see you after i lose another dozen lives okay so destroy the comics again i definitely think rosalina was the right choice for this because now that i've gotten a little bit more used to it it's so much better that never mind that wasn't really rosalina's fault that was just my own inability to make a normal jump okay jumping over them seems to be the more optimal solution is the farthest we've made it and like i don't really don't know how long this level is going to be are we really playing for time here can i take it slower i mean i guess we'll find out sooner or we're a good portion through this l toad you're gonna give me anything you just need to cheer me on some uh positive affirmation [Music] okay oh you know what i see what's going on here [Music] we're trying to wall jump but also not get hurt by the the ants that is easier said than done um i don't know if spinning them takes them out i'm doubting it okay um [Music] why didn't that give me a jump like sometimes like this is we had this issue with the mystery box earlier sometimes it's just not very uh useful come on please no oh that's gonna be tough just because like i don't know what it is about this enemy specifically but sometimes they just don't really give you a jump it's weird here we go again okay so i guess the best way to do that oh we got a water section here is that when you press jump to activate the jump pad just hold the button down don't try to like reset by clicking it again because i think that messes something up so you just hold the jump on the entire time and that should be better even then it's still a really tough and tight jump to make oh i'm glad that the swimming controls aren't too bad in this game oh no no i may have just ruined myself by trying to spin like that okay so they don't give you too much time there to go all the way up but i'm learning a little bit more every time we get farther so that's good okay so bouncing off of those guys is way better didn't even have to take any damage um that happens and it's a problem i think we can get it ready go go go there it is he doesn't have to be really fast with it hit him right on the edge and immediately turn so now we have an extra hit the take and remember i gotta take it fast here so i'm gonna be like right at the cusp of it i think we'll be good just to sort of uh yeah chill up here like this then go back down then go up go up go up so i'm as fast as you can rosalina she has really long arms you'd think that it wouldn't be too big of a deal for her i think she's the tallest out of the five characters no what ah i moved too far forward i didn't realize that you can oh no okay let's learn from last time i actually had to go back and get some power ups uh because it's just been a struggle but you know i'm a cat suit rosalina right now i do think that rosalina is still our best choice with a lot of this okay um that's fine that's fine i was sort of a rushed wait okay the pipe like sort of like visually disappeared there for a second oh my goodness look at all this uh okay honestly this looks more difficult because of the speed boost but i'll just try to keep my timing in mind there you go there you go i thought this angle isn't very no yeah see like i tried okay i thought i jumped there i hadn't jumped and i fall right off the edge i'm not at 20 lives we started with like 85 to illustrate how difficult this level is it's supremely difficult but i'm getting there i'm getting a little bit farther every once in a while we'll get there okay so i've made it back out here again but it's very risky this camera angle is so much better i guess i must have like messed with it myself [Music] okay there's the final green star oh my goodness look at all this whoa okay um yeah i'm gonna slide in like that [Music] definitely using rosaline a little spin move to my advantage here might be my best bat oh can't see what's going on um whoa no no no the angle still doesn't work for me ah darn i was the last one too okay i got all five of them i just gotta not get hit by that oh we did it okay what's next what is okay there's pipes oh it's spelling thank you i think uh okay that's interesting there there's the end that's so interesting this must be the end of it then right as i sneak in like an extra like enemy right at the end then i die to that i would not be fun yeah it is selling thank you no thank you for allowing me to finally complete this level and i think this is like the exclamation mark yeah fascinating okay that was not easy oh and everybody's here we got plussy that's so cute we did it oh my gosh we finally did and i'm i'm tinier on rosalina right now it was so tough we got the lumas we got captain toad we got a big bunny and we get a stamp for all of our troubles okay i need to get the top the flagpole here uh ready oh yeah we did it all right well that might have taken me like an hour and a half or so i'm just trying over and over again losing all my lives i had to go back for more but we finally did it we completed the final level champions road and look at that it is a golden cat mario so the only stamps laughter completing every level with every character i guess that includes champions road oh my gosh not something i currently plan on doing but it looks like we've gotten everything we really can as far as i can tell let's go all the way back to the very beginning and let's see have we gotten every green star i mean i think we had to unlock world crown but yeah like every green star every golden flagpole and every stamp it's looking like it was a lot of fun going through the scheme even if it was highly challenging at times especially this episode by far the most challenging um but it was a lot of fun i really enjoyed this game i definitely see why a lot of you've been wanting me to play it for so long and i'm glad that i was finally able to get around for it the last couple years i've been holding on like oh i know it's gonna come out on the switch sooner or later it just has to um and that's what i've been waiting for so despite the requests i've been holding off and i think it was worth holding off for because now it's on the switch and now we have bowser's fury which will be checking out soon um but as you can see that seems to be just about everything so we got everything in the scheme done that i wanted to get done like i said really the only other thing we could really do um is complete every level with every character which is just something i don't currently have the time maybe if enough people requested over time i can go back and slowly chip away from that um we'll have to wait and see but for right now i will say that there will be one more bonus episode we have a couple of extra things to check out but right now that is gonna wrap it up for today's episode of super mario 3d world thank you guys so much for watching i'll see you next time bye bye",

Hold it!  I'm station\nsupervisor Jason Cole. I came to get my daughter.  Jason Cole. You're clear to go. [screeching]  That's all.  Darnoff. Tell your people to get\ntheir masks back on. We need to keep this\nvirus story locked down.  I don't believe in your\nfairy tales here, colonel. Tell your people we\nhave been vaccinated.  You found what\nyou're looking for?  This is the first\nperson to be bitten?  So I'm told.  Then someone must\nhave taken it out.  Taken what? DR. DARNOFF: The queen egg. The queen is always\nimplanted in the first host. These are male eggs. The queen will be a\ndifferent shape and color. COL. JENKINS: What color? DR. DARNOFF: Brown maybe. Not this.  This is Jenkins. I need all the\npaperwork for the body that we just picked\nup from the morgue, you tell me as soon\nas you've got it.  20 years. Two marriages I\nserved this project. Just to watch it crumble\nwhen the wall came down. And then it falls from\nthe sky right into my lap. And you lose it. If we had the queen egg, none\nof this would be necessary. We wouldn't have to work\nhere in these tunnels. In less than ideal conditions. COL. JENKINS: What's\nwrong with the male eggs? Why do we need a queen egg?  Why do we need a queen egg? The queen is the\nonly one that can produce the quality of webbing\nthat your people require. Can you believe these creatures? These are newborns, but\nalready they work together. They have established\ntheir territory. And now they built a\nnest for the queen. But if we don't get the egg\ninto their nest in 12 hours, she will die. So you and your\npeople must find it, or our work here is useless.  This is Jenkins,\ngive me operations.

Yeah, I see him. Pick him up.  Yes, sir.\nOK, sir. - Please.\n- Mr. Cole--  All I want is my daughter.  We need you to\nstay where you are. Stay where you are and\nput hands above your head.  All right. All right.  Hey, I don't know what\nthe hell we got here. But a lot of people\nconfirmed it's not-- well frankly, they don't know\nwhat the hell it is either.  See, I'm telling you, no\nbacteria in any of the eggs. Everything on earth\nhas bacteria on them.  Hey, look-- before you start\njumping to conclusions about little green men\nand Area 51, get this to our lab uptown pronto. Have them do a DNA breakdown.  They quarantined the\nwhole neighborhood. You have to tell him that\nno bacteria means there's no virus, they have to know.  Yeah. I'm on that, OK? This quarantine\nbusiness is bullshit, but I've got the mayor's\noffice working with me on this, but they're going to\nneed a report on that. So if you can get this\nto the lab pronto, I'd appreciate that.\nCan you do that?  Don't I always?  Thank you. Hey Sarah, give me Dr. Smirnoff\nor whatever the hell his name is on the line.  For Dr. Darnoff.  Yeah, I'll take that. This is Colonel Jenkins. How can I help you? Well thank you, Mr. Puller. Yeah. We'll be in touch. Nikki? We need to clean the trail.  All of it?  Uh huh. Nikki? RADIO: Channel 7's Janet\nSinger is live on the corner of Second and Noble. Go ahead, Janet. JANET: City officials\nsaid today that the virus has been contained.

RACHEL (ON PHONE): Two men\ntried to carjack me, there was--  What? RACHEL (ON PHONE):\n--nothing I could do.  They took my\npurse with the eggs.  The men, what'd\nthey look like?  What's the difference\nwhat they looked like?  Rachel, what did\nthey look like? Where are you right now? RACHEL: I'm-- I'm\nstuck in traffic.  Get out of there. RACHEL (ON PHONE): I\ncan't leave the car.  Just do what I say. Get out, run away,\nleave the car. RACHEL (ON PHONE): I-- I can't.  Yes you can. Do it, Rachel, you have to. [horn honks]  Hey lady, what the fuck?  Good work. All right, back to base. Is that it? DR. DARNOFF: This is the queen. I will get it to the\nnest immediately.  Good.  The police are going\nto want to question me. I--  Will you trust me please?  Yeah. JASON (ON PHONE): Where are you? Where are you?  A couple of blocks\nnorth of the office. [inaudible] bank. JASON (ON PHONE): OK. I'm coming to you. JASON: I'm a couple of blocks-- blocks east. Just act casual, don't draw\nany attention to yourself.  What's going on?  I'll explain when I get there. [phone dialing] Come on, Pete. [cell ringing] JASON (ON PHONE): Hello? Pete, are you there? Can you hear me, Pete? Pete, what's going on? Talk to me, man. Pete?  Jesus Christ. What the hell happened?  Six inches per hour. Six inches per hour. [snarling] It's growing so much\nfaster here on Earth than it ever did in\nour space station.  How big is the\nqueen gonna get?  With genetic restrictions? Seven, maybe eight feet. I have to thank you,\ncolonel, for finding my egg. It is undamaged and it has\nbeen accepted in the nest.  Yeah, it's no problem. So that's what this is about? Huge spiders?  Look like huge spiders,\nbut that is just the form that they are inhabiting. 20 years ago, we discovered a\nspacecraft deep under the ice in the Caucasus Mountains. Must've been there\nfor a thousand years. What we found on that craft\ndefies all explanation. We took its DNA and we\nartificially fertilized it in the zero gravity of space. We tried the gene splicing\nwith many different creatures. It was the spider\nthat had the structure to enable it to survive in\nEarth's gravity and atmosphere.  So, what about the webbing?  Come. A queen spider will\nweave an infinite supply of lightweight, bullet-proof\nstealth material. Whatever nation controls\nthis material will have a military and industrial\nadvantage light years beyond any other nation.  Jenkins. Yeah. I don't care how you lost him. Yeah, they all go\nto the apartment, you can pick them up there. You'll let me know\nwhen it's done.  You're still\nholding these people? You can let them go.  Yeah, the security\nof this operation is my concern,\ndoctor, not yours.  We have the queen egg.\nWe have no reason. COL. JENKINS: I suggest\nyou keep your eyes on your precious spiders\nand your goddamn nose out of my business. Do I make myself clear?  And I suggest, colonel,\nthat you do the right thing and you let them go. [sirens]  Funding's been cut. [elevator chime] [elevator chime]  Excuse me.  Mhm. [elevator chime]  Hey, did you do the\nanalysis on those weird eggs this morning?  Yeah. But I washed my hands. [suppressed gunshots] [shrieking] MANAGER: Anyway,\nwhich department? That's not even my jurisdiction. No, you're going to--\nhold on a second. Can I help you? [suppressed gunshots] [banging] EMILY: Let us out,\nthis is not fair!  Keep it down or I'm\ngoing to arrest you.  We're already arrested. I want a lawyer!  Yeah, sure, I'll get\nyou one right away.  Check the internet.  It's not working.  Ah, there's no\ncell service either. We're going to figure it out. [sirens]  Rachel.  Jason! I'm been calling home\nand I can't get through.  They quarantined\nEmily in the apartment, they won't let me get to her.  [sighs]  Rach? Rach!  We have to go find her--  We're going to.  And what?  We're going to get her back. [sirens] [radio chatter] Move. Move.  They're together. I've got both their cell numbers\npinging off the same tower just about a block north. JASON: It's a lie. It's a lie. We're fine. The government's lying to you.  Come on. We're fine. [tires screeching] [horn honking]  Is your cell phone on?  My battery died.  Good, that'll\nkeep the GPS off.  And?  I mean, the signal's gone. They were right here.  Where?  They should be right here.  Son of a bitch. [trains running] RACHEL: Wait! JASON: I know these\ntunnels, it's the quickest way to the apartment. Hey. This rail is live.  OK, OK. OK. [bats screeching]  It's just bats. Since when is New York City a\nNational Geographic special?  Welcome to the subway. That way. It'll get us closer\nto the apartment.  Here. You should eat. What are you doing?  I've got an idea. PHOEBE: Emily,\nwhere are you going?  Come on! I used to play in here\nwhen I was younger. That was a long time ago.  You mean like when\nyou were an infant? Oh. OK.  That's an Area\n51 in Manhattan.  You won't be complaining\nabout the rats anymore. [thrashing] RACHEL: Oh no! Oh my God! Oh my God! [door slamming]  OK. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no--  Come on!  No. It's dangerous. No-- Emily! Emily! Come back! There's no stairs.  [inaudible].  What's gong on in there? PHOEBE: Come back!\nSomebody's coming! Come on! [radio chatter]  I've got some home brews,\nthat's what I'm talking about. [clicking] [hissing]  Let's move out. COL. JENKINS: How'd it happen? How many? Uh huh. All right. Go to code red,\nas many servicemen as you need just\nfor containment, but hold your fire. Looks like they're\ngetting out of the nest somewhere above ground,\nhow'd this happen? What's going on?  My scientists are smarter\nthan your engineers. Now the queen has been\nborn, they want to explore the limits of their territory. But they won't go too\nfar from the queen. So you tell your\nsoldiers on the street just to stay out of their way.  All right. I'm coming up. [radio chatter] [growling]  Oh shit! [hissing]  Hey, what was that?  Come on, let's\nkeep moving this way. [croaking and hissing]  [screams] Oh my-- ohh! Oh God! Come on!

We pass the giant spiders\nand heavily-armed men that are trying to kill us, get to\nthe apartment, grab Emily, get her past the giant\nspiders and heavily-armed men, and go home free. - That's not much of a plan.\n- No, no, no. Rachel. Come, come-- come! We've got to take\nthe back stairs. Shh shh shh shh shh. Shh. [helicopter blades whirling] DR. DARNOFF: Of course\nthey've attacked you. Your soldiers here\npose a threat. They are only exploring\ntheir territory. Tell you men they must\nstay out of their way!  My men can't hold their\nboundary much longer. We gotta move!  Impossible! She is still dependent on\nthe other spiders for food. She is not ready!  I need her! She has got her timeline\nand I've got mine! You go do whatever you need\nto do to get her ready! We are moving!  Colonel! I want you to know-- you're making a mistake. A big mistake.  Just get her in\nthe goddamn box! [helicopter blades whirling] SOLDIER 4: Stay together. Watch your step.  Hey, don't these things\ntake care of these people? Hey, I have a lot\nof other things I could be doing besides this.  Keep it break down, will you? These things react to sound. You take the east,\nwe'll take on south.  Yes, sir. SOLDIER 6: Copy that.  There's only one\nway out of here. [struggling] What'd you do with my daughter? What'd you do--  For real, man.  What'd you do\nwith my daughter?  I need my mask! JASON: Shh.  I need my mask. Just give me a mask.  Don't make me use this.  No, and I swear, I\ndidn't want to do it. JASON: Shh!\nSOLDIER 6: I need my mask-- JASON: Keep your voice down.  But I didn't want to.  You didn't want to what?  We just put her in quarantine. I swear, man.  Get up.  Look, man, I need my mask.  There's no damn virus. Your superiors lied to\nyou to clear the streets. I don't want to use\nthis, man, but you messed with my little girl.  Look, I know it's fucked\nup, but I had my orders.  How could you? She's 12.  Yeah, and she's\nin the apartment. She's OK. I swear. [gun racking]  Oh please. SOLDIER 4: Freeze! Put the weapon down. Put it down!  This is ridiculous. Try another angle. Just get us back online.  They're covering up\nour inside cameras. We're dropping in\na remote camera. I've almost got it. George, you guys\nrunning a signal yet? GEORGE (OVER RADIO):\nYeah, we've almost got it. - Here, sir.\n- Yes. They're blocking our cameras. They won't let us see the queen. [gun racking]  I'm going to leave, forget\nto lock the door behind me. You can't tell anyone\nI'm doing this.  Your secret is safe.  Wait 10 minutes for\nthe rest of the soldiers to leave the area and\ntake the back stairs. Good luck.  Thank you.  Thank you. [phone dialing] RACHEL: What's happening? Where are you taking us? [sobbing]  You're going to be all right.  No I'm not.  Yes, yes, you\nhave to know that.  Hold your fire! [gunshot] [gunfire]  Fall back! Fall back!

[shrieks] [growling] [shrieks] Go, go, go! [shrieks]  Tell Jenkins I'm\ncoming up to him.  Don't look! Just close your eyes. RACHEL: Hey! JASON: Wait!  We must go now. RACHEL: Thank you.  Jenkins. This is all his fault. I was\nsent to change the world. [rumbling] [explosions] [crumbling rubble] [roaring]  Ah! Come on!  You're so beautiful!

You have to leave the area.  She's got black hair.  She's with the\nolder girl, about 19. Have you seen her?\n- No.  No?  Everyone's been evacuated.  That's a transport truck. She's probably made it out. She may have made it out.  I know you're [inaudible]--  Em!  Emily? - Just stay calm.\n- --even know if they--  Just stay calm, OK?  --made it out. SOLDIER 8: Mandatory evacuation,\neverybody on the truck.  Our daughter is out here.  If she's on the streets,\nshe'll be evacuated. Get on the truck.\n- We're not going.  We're under martial law,\neverybody gets evacuated, no exceptions.  Yeah, well I'm sorry,\npal, but we're not leaving without our little girl.  You're going to die out here.  You want us to\nget on the truck? Shoot us. SOLDIER 8: Good luck. JASON: She made it out. She made it out, Rach. She made it out.  Emily! [sobs]  It's Em.  Huh?  It's Em!

[Music] [Applause] [Music] don't die [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] you just missed it what the hell", "Jw9pV_EsaYI": "[Music] hello zebra herd welcome back to super mario 3d world in the last episode we completed world star and unlocked rosalina but now we have a rocket heading somewhere else i guess farther into space i i i guess we should just hop into it and see what's gonna happen with this one playing his mario today because we didn't really have a full episode last time wow there's a lot of levels here whoa okay i was not expecting that because there's not really too many more badges left over or stamps maybe these levels just don't have stamps it looks like they don't yeah there's no stamp marker on it weird all right then so it looks like we have a lot to explore in this level of this world so let's get started with the first one world mushroom one night falls on really rolling hill so yeah world mushroom that's weird how it's star and then mushroom usually it's mushroom i feel like there's been other games where we've had worlds like this like wasn't uh yeah new super mario bros 2 habits okay whoa maybe these are more like challenge levels there's only like a set amount of time they get to stun in oh my oh my those those hills are really rolling they weren't wrong um yeah not much time here we got to sort of move quick look for the uh the green stars along the way as we get all these little clocks i'm sure that'll help well okay what's up here it looks like more time but yeah in new super mario bros 2 world mushroom more world flower than world star right maybe that's the case but sort of jumbled here so maybe there'll be another world after this world flower that would be interesting considering the fact that oh boy we started with world star i don't know why they would do it that way but it is what it is anyways oh there's at least one green star there but there's got to be more right i guess i'll find out first grab that get some extra time oh i gotta be quick with us oh there it is and that is the first green star okay good glad we haven't missed anything yet honestly it might be a whole lot less stressful if we have a whole collectible we don't have to worry about there's no stamps actually might work out quite well oh come on that was unfortunate um yeah i'm feeling like this was actually sort of like an earlier level i feel like i sort of remember it yeah i definitely do i think it actually might be one of the levels in the first world and i guess it's just sort of redone oh i hear it has to be up here right no i thought i heard it but maybe i didn't i don't know i'm running out of time here uh oh no up here oh oh leave me alone leave me alone okay up here up here but once again running out of time i might die looks like we're going to die here let's find a clock down this way oh wait what's over here oh there was but i couldn't have gotten there i don't think with a small mario yikes that's okay though we keep the two stars that we got now we can run through a bit faster that's always good if i don't die or get hit by anything unnecessary and now we can sort of you know work with some stuff because i sort of remember where some of the clocks are which helps there you go that one over this way it just ow really blending up some time is always good but i can tell this is probably going to be a super tough world this is how we're starting at whoa superstar though that's always useful i think i checked these before did i i don't know how much okay let's get rid of as many enemies as we can not quite getting a one-up from it but that's okay got it yeah no checkpoint or anything for this okay there's a mushroom i don't want to lose it right away this time come on please jump there it is uh hold on grab that extra time and then we're moving oh my gosh okay luckily we know there's not really too much around here now except for some extra time i would love to take dude very tough level so far what i'm worried about though yeah you can't bash through this it's sort of fine though because oh okay this has to be the last screen start sort of fine though because i think although it was there was a watch okay too close too close come on come on mario you got it you got it nice and that's gonna be another green star which we have to get super duper quick because we don't run out of more time oh we got it okay back down the pipe no okay okay that's fine that's fine i forgot that there's safety down here in some way or another then i'll also grab that one and i'll grab these coins normally not gonna worry about it here okay we we've made it so far but i gotta get [Music] top of the flagpole that's what i'm talking about very good all right there so there's our first level in world mushroom going pretty alright so far we definitely need more power up so hopefully we can find those soon but that's what i'm sort of wondering are these all gonna be sort of past levels but sort of remixed in one way or another almost like the comment levels in uh mario galaxy i guess what the weight insane looks like we open up two more levels i think the one to the left is probably the one we're looking for i wonder if we can ride the rocket ship again where does this bring us we actually don't know okay it brings this back down [Music] okay well that's cool and everything good to know for later don't really need that though all right then see the one to the left will probably be our second second level right uh yep world mushroom two spiky mount bean pole oh boy [Music] so we'll keep with mario for today next episode we'll do luigi yeah it really is because this is a mountain beam pole but this time there's spikeys everywhere i guess hopefully we can get a cat suit out one of these i only knew that there was a green star way up there all right looks like there's something up here was another uh sprixie yeah just a different angle of viewing i suppose i do see another one of the key coins but not quite any power-ups for me all right guys can you follow me please oh there's one okay i need that mushroom without getting hat boom and i heard of a couple of them dude you had to be right at that exact spot ah okino that actually might be fine because i'll come back in as big mario i think that'll make things easier here um grab that one key coin is that the phone that's gonna lead to a star it's not gonna lead to the end of the level or anything but maybe i'm wrong here's another one wait where was the all right ready get him out of here whoa whoa that's a different bell yeah mario has like a little collar on why was it a different bell besides the collar was there any reason weird i'm not sure oh and here's a green star just showing back there nice that's super weird i don't know if there's anything different about this power up or if it's just a cosmetic change oh you know what is there aha okay see i was thinking it sort of reminds me of the tanooki leaf there's like a stone version of the tanooki leaf that turns mario into a statue if he slams same thing with this one i guess it turns him into one of those like a golden lucky cat statues that's pretty cool all right then oh grabbing that oh no [Music] there you go whoa whoa that was cool so i guess if you fall like a great distance with this it just gives you free coins well that's a fast way to earn some level ups awesome all right then now we know i'm definitely jumping off the top of this mountain with the big slant then if i can and there's another one for us now we're getting them in reserve that's so cool i didn't even know it was gonna be a thing all right i wanna climb up here if it'll let me but it's not on me whoa okay hold on there it is and i'll just destroy all these for fun there we go jumping over that okay uh i'd like to get rid of you hit that pal block not too bad um i sort of messed it up oh no it's going to disappear there you go okay that works out a whole lot better listen to jump over that get rid of these two there we go very intense so far i knew that there was a no i know that there's a green star up here yep whoa almost missed that tree so maybe that isn't the case maybe we do need uh this to move on where the key coin is at least it's probably gonna be up here right yep so that's gonna open up that right there i guess that's the level and also boom got the green star okay so ready uh that's so cool [Music] awesome um there you go i wonder if you can no okay you can't [Music] and tons of coins for that that were up to 80 lives now i almost slammed to my doom that would not have been good all right then so looks like we got it boom awesome see the levels are a little bit less i guess stressful to find all the secrets and stuff now that we don't have to worry about stamps in this world that's pretty cool doesn't make me curious you think that would mean this is the last world then i guess we'll just have to sort of keep moving forward and finding out all right then see if there's 281 green stars we'll be moving over to the right now though i think that's where the next level is technically going to be uh world mushroom 3 deep black jungle drift so this one is probably one of the jungle levels from like world 2 or something i guess we'll find out all right then uh oh what's back here nothing the camera won't even let me go back that way this is so cool though it's like really dark and mysterious and we got this light and eventually this will scare the booze away uh come on buddy i think i gotta be closer there it is there it is okay oh but right up here i do sort of remember this ah this level we don't worry much in the terms of like power-ups and stuff so i don't see any kind of oh boy any green stars or anything might as well keep moving got him there's another green star right over that way but it might be worth my while to like try climbing up here see if we get anything how do we get that green star though oh sneaky all right all right sorry or is it the same thing oh boy there's the last green star so this one's real easy right i remember missing this one though the original time went through the original level hold on buddy you watch it now okay don't climb up there instead do that and then go through the box very nice okay we figured it out now i'll go up those platforms in just a second first off that's all katherine do it over here hey buddy how are you i guess we got these little cloud platforms to climb up very good and we got it didn't even need to climb up it very good so far we're storming through these levels like they're nothing i mean so far they've been pretty short levels i'm sure it'll start picking up the pace as we go through it uh but so far so good having a great time okay so with that done i think we're gonna go back to the left it's sort of like zigzagging through all these uh to get to mushroom four but it seems like there's a ton of levels like just sort of looking through it we have four more levels here another like set of four or five levels why is there so many levels in this one that's crazy it just keeps going and we gotta do this one soon i look around a little bit to see what else there is but i want to keep with this right now um we got one mushroom for trouble in shadow play alley whoa you can see there's like a silhouette of the uh piranha plant there [Music] 100 seconds to get through it all too oh boy oh we can get a random can it be a star it's a mushroom that's not so good but this is interesting whoa look at this so cool luckily the cats who sort of makes quick work of all that oh no it looks like the game wants me to use boomerang i don't know i'm just trying to get why can i knock it up there there it goes very slippery oh no okay i will get this then here we go let's throw the boomerang over nice and easy second greens are really easy the only problem now is that we are like massively running out of time well there's more i wasn't expecting there to be more okay whoa whoa wait a minute what am i supposed to do about that they trapped me in okay i might as well grab this real fast oh no throw that throw that how many goombas is there like an infinite amount of goombas here like what's going on for all the moves there you go aha and i guess getting rid of all the goombas also gave us that i guess you can't do the the jump dodge oh no we're about to run on time about to run out of time climb climb climb close one all right well that was very interesting but we made it through on our first try yeah i like little like you know i think that they have that in like some of the donkey kong games as well that like sort of like shadow type level i need to play through that one as well the donkey kong for the wii was a lot of fun um either way tangents aside world restroom five back to hands-on hall oh boy this was actually a really tough level to find everything in so we'll see how it goes this time um oh i mean luckily we have lots of time and use that to open the door up knock knock oh there's a luigi okay nothing happens if i'm just like you know knock on another bunch i was very curious i'll get the little trail of coins whoa watch out sir i'll get a baseball all right catch no i missed him there we go whoa hey guys getting rid of them that way seems to be pretty good there we go so what's over this way then looks like we actually got a key coin didn't know we were even looking for those but we are oh my oh whoa okay hold on i wasn't quite ready for that one but it worked out there's another baseball for us there we go that was actually really cool whoa fireball on top of two goombas never thought i'd see the die what's back here the camera wasn't really working for me there definitely grab that there we go [Music] i guess we're good to get it this way oh here's our first green star nice that was cool and we're going to keep moving forward uh oh my ah this is maybe yeah a mistake sometimes it's not good just to jump head first into things like that uh we're moving oh no i'm not moving whoa watch it guys gotcha whoa boomerang tried to get come back to get me not gonna work there's the final key coin but i guess that's it hmm i have no clue where the next two green stars might be but hopefully they're on oh it's so sunny out here and i thought the last time we were here it was uh oh no i definitely need that propeller cap there we go no hey i needed it oh no i'm in trouble oh no you know what i might just want to die then i mean i just have a mushroom anyways uh and try doing that again maybe because they were just all hopping on me there i didn't appreciate it at all whoa almost went too far how did i miss that hold on this is not going so well at the moment jeez why am i so bad at getting the yikes there we go that took a good couple of tries really tough but we figured it out okay so that's green star number two still looking for the third one but that should make it much easier there's a mushroom i can hold that in reserve they don't give you too much in the way of power-ups in this world so far so i'll take everything i can get these fire bros are uh not being the most pleasant thing i can got me some coins which is nice but uh there you go i mean there is the green star but how do i get over to it it's a question now whoa watch it buddy oh okay maybe something with that yeah we might as well go through this one now aha all right and there we go we got it there's our green star all we got to do now is complete the level which hopefully we can do in one piece i would like it out if i can get rid of that guy i mean i did but just not the way i preferred oh you know what we need to go back we need to get another one i don't have a cat suit or anything i really need to be able to get this so let's figure that out there it is this is uh excuse me i can't do that mistake too many more times [Music] oh my now we're doing better though there's not really any enemies up here i don't think there we go all right you know what i gotta do just gotta plop on it very good really tricky level but we figured it out probably the trickiest one yet [Music] okay so uh yeah that's sort of the thing we're storming through these levels but there's just so many of them not sure how much of a difference it's gonna make in terms of how long it'll take us to get through everything but we're storming towards 300 green stars that's still a wild number um so we've gotten all of that done let's try out world mushroom six gigantic seasick rack wow okay uh so i'm guessing maybe under the water or maybe near the water yeah okay it's one of the water levels of course um i guess we'll take this first just bring this to the other side oh my oh they are everywhere gotta wait for that let's definitely get the ones that are closer to them oh you have the chance oh just barely got that in time oh my anything in here just a couple coins [Music] hoping for a power up somewhere but doesn't seem like i'm quite getting that got a slam on those guys [Music] there we go what's over here oh boy is this worth the risk oh hey we're gonna hold up for it pretty cool oh my oh my we got it whoa the mega mushroom see you guys you're outta here knock them off knock them off you got it come on a little bit more there it is okay that got me coins i was hoping for uh oh nice we can even get rid of these guys just barely touch him there i make the most of my time here i should go to get this too uh see what's over to the right that um okay it's our green star glad i checked that before i went through that one box would have been a problem and here we are again oh we'll get another mega mushroom don't mind if i do okay a bit of a problem here but we can make it work giant mario makes everything whoa makes everything look easy right there it is nice come on we can still do a lot here destroying all that i think i'm gonna take care of all this you know what oh no that was sort of a huge mistake i should have used to get it giant mario huge mistake but um i should have used that to get rid of the guys at least making the wind everywhere i jumped right into that yikes okay well i get to keep my green stars so maybe that was a good thing there were no checkpoints in that level though so i'll take it all the way over again okay my goal is to stomp over there as fast as i can um i wonder if maybe that would give me another mega mushroom hmm yeah just like get rid of those guys and then knock a bunch off right i i still didn't knock off many with that but that's not too big of a concern i don't think oh my i see that now i'm struggling see ya no all right let's reset a little bit there we go come on now ah it's so tough okay i'm leaving that one one that one block gone there we go if we butt slam that's the big devastation is the big butt slam oh just sending them offline um let's get back over then and then is okay so just because you can destroy everything doesn't mean you should sometimes you gotta watch yourself a little bit all right you're the last one but yeah we need to destroy all those guys to get that done i'm curious so i did see over this side uh there it is there's even another one just in case you needed it we got the shrimp to go through the box out that's a bit of a shame all right going over you there we go it was a really cool move to get on to the golden flagpole there we've been getting through these levels like they're really tough or still doing a great job that's awesome to see all right then so what do we got next it's the last level of this like little um i guess like elevation before we go up higher that's fine i mean we also have the mystery box i want to do that after this one but this is going to be for 240 green stars we get level mushroom seven broken blue bully belt they just they really love trying to trip me up with these names okay well let's get to it this looks like it could actually be a really tough level oh my because i remember the the blue oh it gets in the key cool i remember the blue lava level before and it was really challenging so i can only imagine this version of it will also be challenging didn't get much from that weirdly enough okay uh there they go oh no oh i'm so glad that you can get do long jump into floating it makes everything so much easier a lot going on here i don't quite see actually there's a green star way in the distance over there so we can find one more along the way probably all we need and we get a snooki suit in reserve that's excellent and here's our other one there's a lot going on here and i sort of messed that jump up but i i sort of know what to do here there's like a lot you could do but a lot of it's also like very skippable so that's nice let's grab an extra but snooki soon might be like oh gosh oh gosh it might be my favorite powerup in the game it's just so useful ah unless you mess it up like that okay let's go back let's go back because i believe it's gonna be an extra one right in there how nice is that why can't i just not be silly i'm being very silly uh there we go excellent timing's gonna be tough here but we did it there's the halfway point i need to try my best not to make a mistake here aha i was like there has to be some secrets around here somewhere right no power up from that maybe there'll be one up here but i gotta draw around like this a lot more because it helps for sure hmm oh no that was bad luckily i survived but now i don't have that tanooki leaf maybe i can get an extra one here aha i can thank you thank you geez that is fast there it is okay this one's not too bad oh no ho um very fortunate there we go so don't get on the plane quite yet because right over this way got ourselves a green star alright then so challenging yes impossibly difficult so far now oh my uh it's best not to speak too soon though we're handling it we're making it work whoa okay here it is big jump we got it it's fine all right then so yeah a ton of levels done already seven levels and a half now right that's that's a crazy amount for this game with the please like that's just a lot okay so there is another set of green stars as well i think it gets really close to 300 we should be able to get over to 300 with this mystery box robots run over and do you can tell that we're going a little higher up now there's a whole new set of things to do over that line just looking around it looks like this is the last thing to do in this blue area before we move on to the pink area mystery house bra oh boy [Music] i'm a little nervous by this one like mystery hospital yeah we're gonna be fighting a lot of enemies which once again like i mean i thought the katsu is just as good as a system like belief when it comes to fighting enemies but i thought this one you know it has like more of a circular motion we can take out oh no and it's gone so you can take out enemies near you maybe i could use this to my advantage oh no i can't bring it with me oh no being just normal mario certainly oh i almost got the double take down but instead i got hit it definitely gives like a certain level of an advantage i'm just looking for any potential power-ups i'm thinking i'm gonna have to redo this one that was silly maybe i should go and get some power-ups real fast that might be better okay i'm back with the cat suit it makes everything so much easier so we will get rid of you get rid of you and get rid of you don't get hit by the boomerang on the way back gotta remember it's a boomerang it's gonna come back all right then uh i don't quite know what's going on with this one oh oh it's these guys there you go i gotta get rid of them quick and on too much time oh because you don't just have to get rid of them you also have to grab the star in that time frame okay lots of goombas [Music] also give you like a little mushroom just in case you know which is nice but usually at this point you'll probably need a little bit more than that okay definitely get rid of the goopy guys before they go electric if you can [Music] got him that was not the right button we're doing okay though we've got to keep going oh comex you don't see the comics too much in this game to be honest with you only a couple of times well we got rid of them super fast not even a problem oh wow the big piano plants the the tough thing with these guys you got to knock them all the way back but honestly they don't have too much of a chance to go far gotcha and we're gonna go okay one more left it's gonna be a bunch of hammer bros gotcha that wasn't too bad at all cat suit got it got rid of them pretty fast and maybe the cup suit is better for fighting it does have a little bit more reach to it so i will give it that much but the tenuki leaf you sort of have like a full range of motion and attack things behind you but maybe that's just not as useful in most situations anyways we're over 300 green stars now that is crazy there's still so much more to do if i take a look at the list here well i guess it doesn't show you what you haven't done huh okay so over this way unless this is like not world mushroom oh yeah this is world star oh i see no it's a world flower oh that's fascinating okay see here's world mushroom that was world mushroom this is world flower oh i get it i get it all right then so that's what we'll talk about the next episode that wasn't too bad at least world mushroom but oh my gosh what a flower that's the tough one it has so many levels like i i thought that that was i i see now i see now this one is gonna be scary because there's 12 levels in it that'll be a bunch of levels to tackle in the next episode of super mario 3d world thank you guys so much for watching i'll see you next time bye bye", "wIfRJbFdx24": "so [Applause] ah [Music] ah [Music] so [Applause] [Music] yes all right [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] ah so [Music] so ha ha ha ha ha ha run it up [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] ah [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi [Music] yes [Music] so [Music] hahahaha ah [Music] bye [Applause] [Music] you", "-1HrruX1LO0": "[Music] hello zebra herd welcome back to super mario 3d world today we are heading into the next world which is sort of weird because it's been sort of like in combination with this area but we got world mushroom done in the last episode now we're moving on to world flower and this one has a lot more levels to it of course um as you can see like world mushroom had eight levels technically this one has 12. so that's a crazy amount we're doing our best to get through it all but let's get started with world flower one switch shock circus we're playing as luigi it's a lot of the extra high jump i always love the circus levels hopefully this is fun but i'm curious to see if this will end up being like remix levels of previous worlds like world mushroom basically was looks like we already got a mystery box right behind the start of it that's good um okay let's hit all those that was a pretty easy star i'll take it good start okay so what's going on over here oh you know what that's actually watch it might be a good place for a fireball i'm thinking the more productive thing to do here is going to be getting rid of all of them and then worry about pressing the buttons i think now i can switch over to the cat see without too much of an issue oh wait there's still one more it's only me um all right he's switching back to his electric mode it doesn't matter which mode he's in when you uh for the fire bottom it'll still take him out now this is sort of an issue ah okay you can just sort of jump and play so that's not too big a deal last one there it is excellent oh we got a hammer bro try to be careful but so for the level layout does seem pretty familiar to me to the previous circle circus levels i think there was a circus level in the first world oh nice we got one of the uh the money capo so we saw this last episode let me climb up here real fast then if we slam all the way down we just get a bunch of coins that's really really cool i could definitely use a couple of extra lives i think we all could right could ever have too many lives whoa whoa that was close oh there's one up for me there we go we're just talking about extra lives i got one whoa that was close too let's get rid of you and you let's get move on i know wait ah i think this is this is not the last one there's still no i read all the time darn oh i'm gonna have to redo the the level then that's unfortunate it's fine we'll just keep moving for now there's other things to figure out i'm sure but it looks like just like the previous world i don't think there's gonna be any stamps in this one because like i said before we only have like four or five more stamps left to get there's a lot more levels than that here okay getting rid of you and then you oh no that should be fine see ya just a couple more left to get we got him so we might as well try to do our best we get everything else oh that was cool wait where's the third green star then [Music] oh right here okay uh there it is awesome this level is not too long at the least that's good gotcha whoa no wait oh i jumped too far still getting used to luigi's jump i probably didn't even have to worry about all that i could just ride up to the flagpole oh well i guess this gives me a chance to yeah i suppose it gives me a chance to go get that second green star again [Music] okay i got back here i messed up the one that doesn't matter any of that because we have the caps dude i gotta do the level again oh this is really tough the level itself really isn't too bad but getting 100 with all the green stars seems to be a really tough task so i thought back into that one but i'm glad that we got it out of the way so that if i will lose my power-ups and i have to exit i don't have to re-get that one green star okay not good let me get back in there but looks like we opened up of course world flower two and flower three uh we'll tackle this soon enough but for right now i gotta get back into this one oh just barely got it in time i don't know why that took me so many tries but it did it was awful i just gotta get through this the worst part is when you die there's no choke points in this level so you just have to sort of you gotta go through everything again like i just messed that up and just it takes so much time to press all those buttons all right then it took me a lot of tries but i got it all three green stars and now it's just done luckily i don't have to do it in one go i'm just really glad that the game doesn't work that way uh but we got it we can finally move on to the second level after like 25 minutes of trying that one and there's 12 levels that's gonna take people off every level's like that i don't think it will be you number now but uh yeah let's keep going over this way we have world flower two floating fuzzy timeline oh this looks cool this looks different sort of it reminds me a level from captain toad oh you know what we've seen we've seen a level like this before so it looks like i don't think my suspicion oh nice is correct that most of these levels are sort of just like remix levels from earlier in the game which honestly isn't too big of a deal that's an instant takedown that's not even just wow crazy um i thought i would just damage him a bit okay let's try not to mess that up too much this time i need to get up here which actually isn't that big of a deal grab that green star and now we gotta move see i guess we gotta go up this way seems like the goal all right try not to go too fast i want to be able to look around a little bit i don't need the three coins that bad gotta be honest we can keep moving there we go i'm much more interested in is trying to find out what is going on with that i don't know um that's a problem oh no okay luckily i can just wall jump oh let me put on the other cat soon there has to be like a yep a green star down there oh a little scared just dude how did that hit me really if you're sure about that one now i'm out of power-ups which is a big problem watch it these guys are chasing me around i can't see uh all right all right i don't like that this does not give you very much vision to work with no this is almost at the power too this probably would have been another cat suit could have really used that i can't say the spinys are mean not appreciated mr spiny okay i'm going in this one why do they give you like no room oh man it feels too claustrophobic okay it's our third green star wait wait wait i missed this one oh there's still two more how do i get to those in time that's crazy you're kidding me wow this level's tough already um oh and oh i thought i was going to die there but i guess oh yes i will i don't know why i was trying to dive to the right but it that was so weird anyways i guess i gotta try again [Music] all right there we go we got it okay so i don't know if i've gotten to the end of the level yet i think that might have been close to the farthest we've gotten there we go i don't know what's with all these blocks back here i don't really see any way to get to them so that's a little weird oh my um don't go this way i still want to take down we got all three green stars so it doesn't really matter just want to get to the end of the level now and here it is all right we got it phew oh my goodness [Music] all right then stop let's see what's going on next two levels done that's still going to take me a bunch of time and effort but hopefully you know we warm up a little bit it gets easier as we go on let's move on to flower three which is right down this way after we unlock this next level interesting that one's like a another blue lava level world flower three piranha creeper creek after dark okay so i guess this one's like one of the jungle levels but it's nighttime that sounds cool actually whoa look at this place so i'll go ahead and scare some of these guys off there you go like might make it a little bit easier to get around here but i can imagine there being like whoa hidden platforms and stuff so look out for that i don't know what this will get me a fire flower you know what i'll use that here and we can use that to light the place up a bit make it easier to see doesn't look like there's too much more over this way there we go much better much better maybe if we light them all up something will happen now i know that there was a secret exit up there last time in like a that was so risky for no reason why'd i do that um oh boy no oh that was a problem that's not at all what i wanted to do okay um you hit him with the pal block that's much better and there's another fire flower for us thank goodness and like keep lighting things up but i am curious because like i said before there was a uh a secret exit up here i think no okay there's like a left but you can't quite get up there that's fine that's fine switch back to the fire flower okay i gotta be extra careful emphasis on careful because if not i don't want to be able to light all these up now that might already be a green star gone almost there's like another one around which i'm doubtful of need to be more careful i i repeat my statement i just said uh okay right now we'll switch over to this and this is where we can find aha there's definitely something secret up there and there's a fire flower for us i'll grab this well like i said we want to keep to this so we can figure out when the world's up here trying to do the the butt slam jump i guess it doesn't quite work does it whoa hey buddy oh i knocked him off no i didn't he's good oh well we can just get him trapped in the corner that's actually quite nice that's good and everything but not exactly what i was expecting okay so where does this pipe lead then and is there more up here because obviously the level continues out now i'm just curious i gotta go down this pipe and see what's going on it just leaves me back here okay so no secret exit this time i wasn't really expecting it but whoa i messed up my jump oh no okay so if you do get them all you do get a green star out of that that's exactly what i was trying to figure out glad i was able to okay so i'm gonna leave those be if i can i already have two fire flowers so if i could just keep with what i'm doing i actually do want to check up here though um that was a little weird whoop i know just get up get up there you go is there any extra torches or anything it doesn't look like it [Music] just in case there is another green star like that i want to be actually sure i do get it i do see over this way okay you don't even have to do all that just the normal jump there has to be oh no no okay too much for me too much for me i just want to get that i'll jump on this guy's head a little bit there we go oh my goodness how intense is all this okay he's gone god i go right into the lava again it's so tough at this point i'm finding it oh gosh much better i say that but it's still so tough because how fast this is spinning funny much better to try to avoid these guys and not wake them up okay there's another fire flower for us if we really need it luckily right now we don't there you go oh my no i'm in big trouble if i don't get off this platform okay okay it worked it worked get the sleeping ones i might just be better off avoiding it okay i made it i made it thank goodness i made it let's light these two and hope that's another one wow that's good okay so i guess i'm supposed to be jumping off of him but i'm luigi i don't gotta question is now where is that third green star looks like it's gonna be through this pipe i guess we have more towards this light i feel like we're at the end of the level though weird i mean still they're very possible it's just gonna be that again all right then no i messed that up okay that's actually no problem no problem that's a problem um i think i could do this no luigi seriously all right then um i guess i'll have to replay through the level to get that because yeah luigi's can't ah that's unfortunate oh wow well there we go course clear we got everything else i was going through the level one more time so that i can get the top of the flagpole that shouldn't be too big of a deal but man every level has its challenges right worth a 315 green stars up so we're slowly getting through it and then i'll lead back to you know world flower four which we'll get to eventually okay i've been having such a hard time climbing this flag pulled i was like whatever he's gonna grab a cat suit from another level just bring it here because i don't know what it is i jump off of that piranha plant i just get no height and no momentum from it even if i'm playing luigi who has the most hype from jumps it's weird so i'm ignoring it we're just gonna move forward and like i tried long jumping on i tried just normal jumping off of them just wasn't working so i mean if this works why not you know uh that's a good thing about this power but anyways move on to flower for faster fort fire bro so there's probably one of those levels that only has 100 seconds to it or something i'm assuming let's find out oh even less only 30. oh boy well there's our first one so of course we've gone through fort firebros in the past our main goal here of course is to get stuff like this i can sort of skip out on some of that which is nice oh excuse me fire bro please be nice to me get a one-up out of that one honestly we're starting to lose a lot of lives recently now if i remember correctly i don't know if that'll be the case this time but it's brought me way up before it gets me extra time sort of unfortunate that it's not oh no this is a mistake it was not a mistake it could have been whoa whoa that was awkward our fireballs met in midair oh there's definitely a green star up there probably the smarter way to get up there whoop there's doing a bit of this not what they intend i don't think but hey if it works for me it works for me okay i'll grab some of that i'm a little concerned i'm missing out on some potential green star action by doing that but it's right here so i guess that was good to not worry about it get over this way do the same thing all right so far not too bad but we are starting all the time we have 15 seconds left over oh boy oh here's two more nice thank you oh i need to get rid of him to move forward don't i um that's never fun there it is once you get rid of the fire bro everything else sort of moves forward okay you know what i really i don't want to relive the same thing okay it didn't matter i was actually able to figure it out normally awesome all right then with 12 seconds to spare we made it through [Music] okay that was actually a level we did on the first try in this world totally unheard of okay so where are we going next looks like there's actually two totally different branching paths here all right that way and that way so wait what's with this level why is this level just sort of on its own like this world flower four and then world flower five but there's no connector to it could i have just tackled this level at any time uh this is sprawling savannah robin run all right home sweet home here we are so this is always so cool we had a level like this before but now the bananas the rabbits where did banana come from i don't know uh roberts are huge these guys aren't the nicest gonna be careful about that i'm gonna chase this big bunny around i'm gonna get you gotta be careful oh use the speed boost i don't exactly know where he's gonna go i don't know his pattern all too much but we're closing in on him oh come on come on there's another speed boost gotcha all right so there is our first green star let's look around this area a little bit though i do see to the left of the pipe let's try going into this one oh this brings its way over here okay this isn't exactly what i need but i guess i'll grab the extra time sure why not 100 extra seconds for us i'm not mistaken this is just going to lead to uh [Music] whoa whoa that was cool uh going up there though is going to lead to at the end of the level it's like that's fine we'll figure it out at some point there we go and this guy don't think i didn't see you over here how many hits does he take like a lot there we go 72 lives i do want to back it up a bit because i feel like there's there's got to be more nothing there apparently weird i like this little trail aha i hear it there's a green star i don't know how we were supposed to do that i guess we were supposed to go through that pipe over there i didn't need to we're playing as luigi we can handle it but i guess we should check with the sprexie where exactly are we off to the goal's up there sort of peace out when we get there i i have a feeling then that the third green star is going to be somewhere along climb in the mountain thank you for the coin so let's try to find that out now yep just come up this way whoa all right all right didn't time it perfectly knocked into the wall down oh oh wow we need toad okay good to know i'm not towed at the moment i'll replay through the level but that's fine oh no there we go okay top of the flagpole for us very nice so we got everything on there relatively easily getting the third green star really shouldn't be very difficult at all because we just got to go back in to just run up that high a very easy level very fun to explore though i like that one all right then definitely a lot of fun [Music] so that shouldn't unlock any more levels for us like it's not i don't think it's so weird they'll just hop right back in and switch over to toad all right so i just zoomed over here real fast and with these guys just gonna take him out super quick slam on the button and would you look at that whole green store over there it's a little concerning but i think we can get that there we go oh scary all right and this should also be this level completed as toad so that's always good all right that was actually really easy to storm through it's a little side level very easy to complete happy to see it so with that being done as you can see decent clear time we'll switch back over to luigi when we hop into our next next level which i think is going to be the left here that was world star six or five so now we have votes or flower six uh shifty or blue mansion all right so we got another haunted level here let's switch over no wait oh luigi i forgot rosalina was there [Music] oh spooky whoa look at this wait a minute hold on hold on now hold on excuse me thank you uh this is so cool it's like an old movie it's a fire flower for us i'll hold on to that one love one cat suit i think that works out quite well and i think that's purple god it was fake it was fake the whole time anyways hold on excuse me thank you it's not really too much of a reason to go down that way it seems hmm all right uh i'll remember to stand on the sofas sometimes it does stuff oh there's one up waiting for us and more actually there's a fake one on all right well i'd rather a green star if that's what i need this is gonna be another fake one two two fake one-ups this is cruel all right i think this is also a fake flagpole i remember honestly it ow very similar similar level so far like not too much is different okay now but before you do that hit me with all this stuff no come on the moving platforms one of these has to be real thank you jeez um no way it moved me too fast but hey we got the green star for it right did that count yeah it did so i was gonna get to be on the level so could have been worse could have been worse okay i guess we didn't go this way before i just wanna oh okay um then maybe going this way would be better a little confused we just didn't go this way at all before maybe it'll keep bringing me somewhere it won't so of course the goal i guess ow is not that that was silly at me um oh we got some golden rings we want to do some acrobatics here not too bad not too bad where are we trying to go uh i guess it's down this way i guess it loops this round the same line now these were all fake except for that one now i gotta be really really careful here because this is so tough and easy to mess up but we got it and the scary thing is yeah how many more foods are going to pop up ah run luigi run oh my long jump no oh that's a problem wait a minute that was fake anyways or what's this oh you know that probably was fake let's see what this is aha well no it just resets me which honestly i appreciate [Music] all right boo i really need you to move if you don't mind like i can't really turn around too much or that happens all right i'm just gonna try for it oh no that was fake wait a minute and where is this what do i just go through the door that's what was before oh no this is the real mystery what's going on how many times do i have to go through this before trail aha i see it down there there's a little box whoa that was a risky way to do it i'll tell you that much so will there be booze popping up this time this one's like oddly oddly quiet [Music] all right ready i can't mess this up and i didn't phew tough level very spooky all right then so there's another one done though i'm glad we're sort of we're starting to go a little bit faster through everything which makes me happy all right so that ghost mansion is done i don't know what this rock to our right is actually that looks very interesting uh because as you can see i guess we need all the stamps stars and golden flagpoles well that's the problem i mean we're making good progress with some of that all the stamps oh gosh a button so here's world flower seven so we still have a good chunk of levels left to go like we're not quite done here guys okay we'll keep working on it um let's go back over to world flower seven which is right down over here i mean this one looks fun pipeline boom lagoon [Music] looks like another underwater theme level those are always fun ah these are always the best because they're super relaxing hmm get some extra coins from that definitely need to be a little bit more diligent with getting coins because i just i really need them oh okay i see why it's boom lagoon let's charge this up a little bit boom all right very good just trying to get rid of those guys before they they get rid of me so i wonder if we can uh yeah do anything about that i'm really looking for power ups because i'm not doing so hot with that right now is goomba gone we're getting some coins which is you know it's something at least hey buddy thank you for the coins aha oh not too much i don't think you can do the butt slam jump no you can all right what's going on in here this looks like a peculiar little spot right but it's not fun [Music] okay definitely try to deal with the tadpoles they're so cute though even if they are a little menacing what about over here there's a lot of little corners in this level so far that don't lead to anything oh gosh shiny goombas tiny goombas they're mad short they're big goomba statue oh no oh i need another one i don't know if there is another one [Music] that's a problem if right now i'll just do a bit of that [Music] i wonder if i could just slam it okay that works i hope i can get another count on soon [Music] i also hope that there is a uh a green stars and i haven't found anyone whoa whoa that was almost a mistake hmm all right tadpoles are gonna be a lot more aggressive now they have their chance to attack aha but look what i got again oh gosh on that guy i don't think i can defeat no matter how much i charge a sign let's find out that nope it tickles him that's sort of cute little chuckle okay this is not the way i need to get him maybe down this pipe so weird i haven't found any green stars yet it makes me think i must have oh gosh it's blooper my number one enemy uh i must have missed something somewhere right oh gosh uh okay this barely squeezed by that one we got it oh there's blooper again okay we can get through this one there's a green star that really is the first one though i'm so surprised by that might mean this is a longer level than normal because i've noticed that there's a lot of levels in this game the levels are pretty condensed most of the time what's this about this seems weird okay how much you can do about it so we'll keep moving well it gives us another one if we need it right now my main goal is to destroy all bloopers before they destroy me i don't have a problem with bloopers that they they weren't so aggressive that's sort of the thing i think the bloopers are really cute in terms of like being a character this is what's not so cute is that their constant attempts to destroy me okay we're slamming down oh no that was probably not the best idea luckily there is still another one over here why can he go against the spikes not get hurt there we go all right let's get over there destroy him real fast or he destroys me run out of time oh wow what about these two okay there's coins out of that still looking for the third green star i can only hope ah all right that was good luckily the cannon actually helps a ton with that there it is all right those give me like oh well they just sort of scare me a lot now uh because oh boy okay we got a lot of time from something there i wasn't really paying attention but uh the green star coins are sort of scary now because of the last couple levels have been really tough with them oh no i've gone up there somehow oh luigi can get up anywhere you want there we go all right long jump boom we got it excellent all right then very good stuff course clear looking good so yeah with that done well we're starting we definitely like it started slower than it is now we're picking up a bit of a better piece oh okay so that was world flower seven i've done them correctly in order right yep okay is this world flower eight that's world flower nine they really do make that hard to figure out but world flower eight blast block skyway oh it's one of the switching ones this is surely going to be difficult we'll figure it out whoa whoa okay it's not even doing like the one two three one two one two one two okay i think i can keep with that rhythm i might not be saying much uh vocabulary or diverse vocabulary because i'll be focused on uh just keeping pace two one two one two okay i need mario for this one all right well already gonna have to replay through this level oh oh i mean i i try my best to keep on rhythm i feel like i'm not too bad at keeping rhythm most the time i really like rhythm games i've played a lot of different kinds of rhythm games oh no i say that they're so good at them but i do like them a lot okay so that's in turn out so luckily you know we get a lot of leaves for this and i appreciate that ah i thought i jumped there that was a little weird i'll get another one here i don't have to use my spare what's weird is that you know huh you know what it is i think hitting that button will give us like a double cherry or something i can skip out most of this and that'll probably lead to a star later in the level or something like that i can only imagine because it's just sort of weird how it was before the first green star this is actually really tough two one two one two one two one two all right there was not even anything over that was just sort of a diversion okay try to grab all these this one seems to give us a little bit more time which i highly appreciate there it is that's the second green star i really think that what it must be because i remember there being on the original version of this level there being something with the double cherry i think we need to play as mario it'll give us a double cherry there we go and that'll lead to the third green star or something it's definitely not a stamp you know that much there's an extra leaf but there was something more just some extra coins i'll take it though oh see ya and see ya two one two oh i don't know if this is the way you're supposed to do this like this doesn't feel right [Music] whoa okay i got the green star though i like a good rhythm going on but you can see like maybe not then yo what's with the mario button i'm so curious about the replay through level just to see because now i'm like really really curious two one two one two there it is easy okay well that actually turned out really good but like why was there a mario button if we have all three green star like what could that possibly be and if it is a double cherry what's the point it's just you know uh weird okay so we're gonna hop right back in because i need to satiate my curiosity here curious like a cat i guess you know plain as cat mario so that mixes pretty well uh so back to mario oh no actually we're not playing his camera we're playing a snookie mario never mind and let's see the mystery of the mario button it just gets me a couple of extra coins oh you know what it probably is maybe that button was like already that is so weird maybe it was like already part of the original level because i noticed they don't change much about the layout of the original wire levels it has changed some elements uh but yeah world flower nine towering sunshine seaside oh we get another uh beach type level already that's great all right only a hundred seconds now much better than 30. oh my gosh the tower of goombas over there hold on i hear a green star immediately to our left look at that thing it is menacing all right well we'll have to do everything we can about that the giant cannons will surely out they're not even giant they're just cannons i'm gonna keep through the tanooki leaf right now or i get there a fire flower they give us an arsenal of equipment oh my actually i i might looking at this i don't know if these will light up the thing they don't so actually i might need the firepower right now though the time is a little bit more of a concern got an extra 10 seconds there and an extra 10 there so let's switch over to the fire flower so it can light up these pillars because i'm pretty sure that's by the gas well how do i i can't how do i take this off i i i can't all right well i gotta get hit somehow then right i guess that's where this is useful that's weird this actually gets us a green star be even weirder considering that it does okay hopefully there's no other things like that because i don't know because i don't have any more green shells to hurt myself with getting under the giant goomba tower must do something in terms of like a green star extra time he's gonna keep charging the shot up there we go the tower is getting lower it's getting lower there it is i didn't do anything for my time that was very satisfying to do that okay i don't even have to go down the the thing will hit it for me i am still oh gosh running all the time and i'm about to sneeze too oh okay so i do have to get rid of those towers to leave this level extra time down there that's great where in the world oh there's a oh i'll take that there's our final green star thank you very much i will gladly take this one we're doing our full cat run there let's go for it oh man i still might run out of time no no we got it we got it we got it ready go there it is with seven seconds left intense i love those though the quicker levels we usually get done in less try so like i'm honestly i'm fine with that okay then wow we've had some interesting experiences today says world flower nine completed which means there's three more left to do i think it's 10 11 12. all right then so let's move on over to flower 10. whatever this way honeycomb skyway oh boy i remember the original level it was very tough i think that was in world star [Music] but it was a lot of fun so yeah we'll use this flower power up for now or the flower boomerang what am i talking about i want to sort of uh heard of as many of these uh what are they called para bitty buds because they're flying i don't know i sort of messed up but i got on the rebound okay first green star right there don't have to worry too much about the the one guy maybe we shouldn't hey that was a little ice skating jump i like that whoa hey guys that was a little crowded i love this music so much it gets me really excited i i'm planning on playing you know galaxy at some point i'm gonna play through sunshine first i've been a busy zebra playing through all these mario games uh i hear that one now i guess the expectations would go through the pipe but with the boomerang we don't need no pipe now last time we didn't actually need this cherry for a green star it was just sort of there [Music] so that's odd and it gives us twice the boomerangs which is nice all right um let's get rid of you i'm a little worried there's gonna be like a green star that requires we get rid of all these guys so i try my best to do exactly just that well at the least it's a bunch of coins everywhere it's also very satisfying to take them all out oh uh yeah i don't want to do that too soon or that'll just be a pipe into nothing whoa watch it buddy speaking of which there it is sometimes it's better to take your time okay don't go too soon it's gonna wait for the platform to show up i also realized i've been playing as mario this is me playing as luigi my bad okay dude i really hope now i didn't need that cherry for anything i guess we'll find out i'm gonna jump over all that please and thank you uh too many too many there's no way i can sort of fire at all these guys at once so it might just be better to dodge and jump so it looks like here's the last screen start so once again i didn't need the double cherry for anything it was just sort of there i guess no wait okay phew so it looks like i can buy some time just doing this that was a scary one [Music] it looks like it expects you to do that okay somebody moved there was that just the bird i guess so if we're trying to get rid of all these guys as soon as possible and there we go we did it all right whoa oh yeah i remember i remember it's much faster than before oh no where's luigi when you need him where's luigi when you oh wait i have cats dude never mind we're fine that's why it's always good to have an extra one thank goodness wow all right then so we figured it out world flower 10. not too bad took a couple of tries but we got it down okay so what is next obviously we're flower 11 but i wonder what that level will be 336 green stars now this is going to be oh something like fortress type level world flower 11 spiky spike bridge sneak okay then i'll switch to luigi real quick there we go oh wow okay see i remember this level we played this one as toad whoa okay how does this work i already messed up messed up my catsuit all right excuse me fire bro i'll switch over to the boomerang oh i didn't even see the lights i'm so silly [Music] okay i think i understand now so if we get caught by those lights i see them the spikes will go off i like honestly didn't see this before there's a green star in the distance i don't know that'll be our first one or not so we really want to be sneaky here our goal is going to be to let this pass turn over this way and then go for it go for it boom and that is our first green star good to see this fire bros calling me but the light hasn't it's honestly these platforms actually aren't that scary okay that that's a problem um if you don't get caught by the light if you get caught by the light it's a much bigger issue how do we actually get a checkpoint for this level wow yeah we haven't really been getting too many checkpoints i wasn't expecting it okay ready cool there's another cat suit for us which it expects us to have as you can see um there it is good job we were able to make it oh my gosh i almost figured that out would have been really cool i should just switch over to the boomerang i didn't miss out on anything oh no oh okay now i gotta switch over to the boomerang wait what's the i don't know what the bowser face is about other than it just being how you've been caught no okay somehow whoa didn't fight okay it's worth it it's worth it there it is oh no gotta be careful these donut platforms these ones fall faster than they do in some other mario games now this is a little too fast for my liking i just gotta focus on surviving for now [Music] oh my god [Music] oh [Music] and we got all three green stuff i don't know how i didn't even notice that so how in the world does this work i think i just got to be fast okay we made it like one moment to spare there wow intense level for sure that that means we've done it there's only one more level left to do in this world it's taking me a ton of time to get here we're doing great just gotta keep at it so what will this final level have in store for us won't be super duper challenging i can only imagine whoa okay we've got a big bowser face it is world flower 12 boss blitz and i'm going into it as tiny luigi uh oh um i think that i'll probably die here that's fine i'll start over as normal luigi oh i like it so we just have a mystery box assumingly for each boss okay this is actually quite an easy one to start with so we're going against all the like world bosses again that like probably weren't bowser or something okay i probably would have been a good time to jump on him it's fine okay yeah let's get him to fall over this fight just like that perfect got a good slam on him i don't know if sliming on him actually does extra damage as it does with like you know other games okay just got to pay attention to sort of the red shadow he leaves oh it tells you all about where he's gonna land and how you can slam on him okay yeah not quite what we wanted them to do [Music] there we go see ya all right then it seems like slamming it doesn't really do much more all right so there's the first boss done in the boss blitz i'm not gonna get a power up i'm guessing that's sort of the rough part but hey this gives me sort of a good idea of like what's going on with everything even if i do die here it's not the end of the world and i do get a key coin for that okay that's gonna work this is either boom boom or pom-pom and it's pom-pom should have probably been able to guess with the pink accents on the wall seems to be her color whoa whoa how'd i mess with the slam that badly yikes okay well that's fine i should probably go back get some extra power-ups or something probably be in my best interest all right so we're tearing it up with cat luigi now i also have an extra one just in case one thing i do notice is there's still three green stars to get in this level i don't know how that works so as we're taking on pom pom i guess just look out for green stars somehow maybe like some of the bosses drop them now this boss works you don't remember gotta get rid of the one with the pink shirt again the others are i guess just sort of like imposters there you go okay this one in the corner luckily it's you know not too difficult i thought that wasn't the hardest version of pom-pom but maybe we've only got against pom-pom once in this game we'll get her a bunch in 3d land and boom boom which i'm sure is the enemy we're going to be going again soon what is this one oh it's a snake right this one's my favorite the histocat oh there is two of them oh they're so cute i didn't know if there was two of them or if they got a makeover what was going on that's so cute [Music] all right well two at once is certainly a bit more of a challenge um don't want to go on the one that has the uh okay wait wait get up here get up here oh and big cat slam can i get to the other one oh he got so sad he's like no my friend okay well there's a bonus cassie that would have been useful if i just held on to that but honestly a boss by giving a power-up is really oh good until like that's why i should have just held on oh i'm so silly it's fine no come on ah actually two at once is really challenging so far that should be more than enough to give you a slam i wonder if i could land on one and then the other i just don't want to risk if i'm down at one cat suit already so i have a couple of bosses to take on after this so big problem fireballs flying everywhere okay once again no but they go away at the worst times you think like they give a lot of height and then you actually no come on just let me out let me up oh my goodness there's another cat suit i need it okay the catsuit stop is very good no matter what just take it slow if we need to take it slow we have plenty of time okay that's plenty of height to get up here jump off of you and then slam and there we go the two for one is possible awesome all right so i think they both just seem to be hit one more time so if we could get that two for one again that'd be good promise no that was a trick that was actually they tricked me okay get to the top of you jump off of this lady boom thank you all right [Music] there's that and right over here we'll grab all this as well [Music] okay so as you can see that was a green start but the second one so i'm hoping these other bosses do drop some i'm a little worried now that we just have one one cat suit but i think it'll be fine look at this dude so this one's pretty simple there's another one that we just have to be careful and sort of just play it safe how rude is he destroys his own friends that was such a weird angle though i couldn't really get one of them without being hit by the other okay this is a little bit better a bit more spread out come on oh yeah that's right he does not take any damage when he's spinning like that let's go toss him off because i think if you hold them for too long they do pop out we don't want that so we've hit him once oh no oh there we go that was good that was good stage those as well as we can paying attention in the shadow seems to be a relatively good idea all right then just gotta hit him one more time no wait what that was weird all right um he's spinning around right now which is not super useful come on oh good timing now i think he just finished spinning there so it's good that we got rid of him but it's not good that we don't have any more power-ups left okay we just need one more green star though so i guess that's like the intended order is to do him first or something i'm not sure but now it's boom boom we can handle boom boom right hey buddy all right well he's gonna be spinning i'm gonna slam on him i wonder if that counts as two hits like i it didn't for the one guy but maybe since boom boom's a little bit more of a traditional jump on his head kind of awes yep no okay i am losing time here though oh gosh she's fully invisible at the moment there it is it is got him all right didn't take any damage with boom boom the lack of time that was scaring me is there gonna be another boss after this where's the other green star i don't know like if we had to fight bowser after all those in 68 seconds i want to be in big trouble oh there is there's one more fight it's gonna be this guy we gotta deal with him fast i mean like super fast that's a problem okay oh wow he's like a a ruby color this time before he's been silver he's been gold get the double cherry hit you there we go so far great start it's a pretty fast moving boss fight but remember we got to beat this guy then we have to grab the green star then we have to probably go get a flagpole like there's a lot going on got him okay used up about half of her time here now a little bit more he's jumping around i don't know if we'll be able to do this clock's ticking he's still jumping oh no that got rid of both of them and it hit me no i fell off the side and it didn't matter in my rush of trying to get it done i messed it up yikes i'm gonna go get more power-ups again now okay going back into it i have at least one cat suits that works great i have plenty of time i didn't take any time to like grab coins or anything we just went from one boss to the next i try to focus on getting them done fast i definitely didn't take as long with the two snakes the histocrats so let's see if this works now you got 143 seconds so much more time actually that looks 130 seconds when are the little cutscenes take up time you want to think so oh no well there goes your catsuit no no the angle is so difficult to see you're kidding me i gotta do it all over here we are again i got two cat suits plenty of time take it slow don't jump off the edge do none of that oh my goodness it's been so tough but we got it this time i really i have a good feeling about it so he's gonna do all that i'm gonna ah okay well that's fine that's fine excuse me guys excuse me i have a place to be it's over this way i'm gonna catch up to this gentleman and little bop on the head they also show the cat scene i just got a one notch ready you just gotta start swinging right now though probably best bet to just dodge these little rings you did still get that first try i guess like the pressure sort of helped there we go i got i lost one that's fine so it looks like the hit like that with the swipe is good enough that's the case i'm more than happy to do that because that's easier the only problem is when he jumps and it sort of gets in the way of the screen so fast too um there we go got an extra one i think i lost one doesn't matter we got him all right excellent and there is the last green star oh we did it i can't believe it we are running out of time it's not a big deal on if we could have we could have gotten that extra time there that was a hundred extra seconds but when all the time we need it okay it's a big jump then climb it there we go that took a lot of tries a lot of effort but we got through it all wow 12 really tough levels in world flower chorus clear whew what a wild time that was all right then so as you can see we we got that done clear time 417 seconds then gets the 342 green stars the final world is now open and where is that is that back over this way indeed it is it turns that final thing into a rocket ship which i guess we'll check out in the next episode how cool is that see ya every level in world flower was complete oh that's different so yeah as you can see oh i see all right then so what's going on here is that to get the final stamps in the game as you can see um there's a couple that sort of have like a circular shape to them i think that the characters portraits five of them so there should be one for mario luigi toad peach and rosalina if you complete every level with every character you get that respective character stamp that would take an insane amount of time to replay through the game practically five times so i don't currently plan on doing that maybe at some point if you guys want to see it but yeah uh as you can see i don't even know is it completing the level or getting to the top of the flagpole cause that might make it even more difficult maybe at some point i don't currently plan on it but uh yeah next episode will be tackling the final world whatever that has in store for us really looking forward to it but for right now that is gonna wrap it for today's episode of super mario 3d world thank you guys so much for watching i'll see you next time bye bye", "PJi2JypAVk0":

I like so wait I want to okay where is her oh yeah wait where's the food where's the food was she eating in the kitchen or something where was she oh okay really that is the shortest chair I've ever seen okay I'm gonna put that put this like right here quick yeah all right but the bear trap on her chair well actually let's put it on the chick we put on the chairman's you'll see it but who cares their bear trap on the it's a chair trap now well it's cut on the side no I guess you can't really put it on top but yeah let's put it there and then okay what are we supposed to put obviously what is this salt hey oh geez I hurt myself oh no I used the dirt great good job buddy okay run away before but I I just gave her some salt wait hold on that what is this what kind of sauce is this chilli sauce yeah let's add this too let's add this too hold on hold on I'm adding chili sauce no wait salts good I want to put the chili sauce okay she's coming oh she's coming she's coming she's coming she's coming wait a second oh there's a star in there I'm gonna go get that you do kind shouldn't be drinking the wine what's she doing but like she might like it sure the sauna it's a nice sauna oh but I didn't put chili sauce I think she might actually she might like it oh no I killed her she's okay yeah okay well that was kind of easy does she ever actually chase you all right mess of the TV so misty cannot watch her favorite horror show okay wait she's herself on the show are you kidding select an ability sneezing gas laughing gas sneezing gases give her I'm not gonna say it but give her an you know what all right tap on an ability to enable know what's happening ah what's wrong are you let's go this okay stars can be used to buy hints and items in game ah okay I'll grab that oh my goodness okay guess we're gonna have to do this because it's making me reveal him smash the TV with a crowbar that's destructive is there anything else we can't like can we do wait what else Oh No okay I was gonna see if there was anything else we could do like let's know what no I don't want to wait why oh it costs three and I've only got two I need another star because I want to see if there's like anything we can do that's like not as destructive or maybe like a funnier thing we could do I mean we've got this key look I know the crowbar was in here last time let's see if it's still here yeah we'll grab that I mean is there anything else like we could I mean we could pour gasoline on it if we could find like a match or something that would be awesome yes still says find CV a break with tools so I think that's what we're gonna have to do but let's see if we can find another star and find something I mean I guess we have to break it I really want to set it on fire oh can we go to our basement I don't even try this before we go ah dude check it out let's inspect her basement this is give me granny vibes dude what's all that Oh Yoshi okay she's got two crowbars down here why do you have so many crowbars hey who's this who's this a picture of this is like her daughter or something all right we got to go up now I think the only thing we can do is the crowbar it seems like that's what it wants us to do so we can do that wait where's our TV I don't even know where our living room is dude which one's our living room uh-huh no that's not it okay I use this again oh you can keep using it it replenishes sorry I gave you the you know you know you should wash your hands more uh-huh didn't wash your hands did you oh jeez no no no no no no no I kind of chased terrified Oh where's she huh oh okay all right wait oh she runs kind of weird though so I think we can get away from her although the pride where's she gonna donate she's choking me to death [Music] okay stop messing around we're gonna get her this time Wow she's scary died fine all right so I think what we're going to do them is like I'm not gonna I'm gonna grab this I don't know what this is for but what I'm gonna do is I'm not gonna use oh wait where's the pote oh it wants me to use that potion or wait I don't have that potion I was gonna say I'm not gonna use the potion until she's chasing me and then I can start her sneezing but apparently oh dude you can't hide in here okay well apparently wait what does this say drop to place oh okay oh dude II can move that around that's pretty old my goodness I did not set those so she set bear traps on the window to keep the kids out right is that yeah yeah yeah you try use it on me I'm gonna use it on you what's the what's the flashlight oh wait what did I do with the trap okay we need to be careful oh she's fixing her hair now where she's gonna heal by the way I'm trying to figure this out but like how does it teach her afford a house like this this is like this is kind of insane the house that she's got here Oh TV all right here we go let's do this here we go here we go can we use it hey go before teacher catches you yep I'm out I'm out oh let me grab a bloxy cola though thirsty wait we kind of saw look I could have sawed the TV okay she's gonna cry she's gonna cry let's go this way she's got pictures of her head that's not a nice picture what do I have this all looks like a razor blade dude how do I get out of here I gotta get out cuz I think okay I see her look at all oh dude okay can I say goodbye this oh there we go yes nothing dude you need a new TV anyway I think it's old you got this beautiful house you got an old TV like that alright let's see we got next okay ruined mrs. T's dress prevent her from going to the masquerade party why should she be allowed to have any fun okay let's see ok so let's watch I hopefully a mask because your face you think okay so you don't have to you don't have to use one but yeah we're gonna we're gonna go to the sneezing guess again oh no want to watch a video to do that so you don't have to use an ability and I have to watch a video to do it and I'm too lazy so let's find a way to ruin the dress okay oh wait scissors can't we cut it oh yeah this love key is still here no just stop I think I know what to do I'm gonna try and figure this out on my own without getting hints so I think we could probably cut the dress so like no where's the scissors leave ya also again gasoline we could burn the dress maybe okay weird the other thing is where is the dress that is the that's actually a good that's the question where's the dress can we get in we just go right in it could be here nope alright I mean I see the picture of the dress oh yeah yeah yeah yeah where's your dress huh tell me tell me dummy wait where she's in the bathroom I don't know woah okay that scared me a little bit okay bloxy cola watch out okay the vacuum can we use the bathroom no we can okay I mean I was gonna do some housekeeping for her but wait what is this a firework I didn't see her that's what that noise was wait let go of me I feel like I feel like it's gonna be upstairs alright I'm pretty sure it's upstairs what was that thing I grabbed oh yeah look here we go wait there's a kid's room here like you're not there like I'm thinking it's gonna be whoo oh oh she keeps trapping the doors oh dude this is like for hiding okay do oh um so this is like hiding under the boot oh you can't hide under the but you can hide in that closet where is she she's in the bathroom but I don't know what that bathroom is upstairs or downstairs whoa hold up dude what is this like everything in a room is letting you know in our house is killing do does she have an electric chair hang on a second is that that's an electric chair okay that's it she is definitely evil oh I see her I see right here Oh hide hide hide I died I died I died I died hold on hold on where's this no no no hello jeez no no no no no no get down get down gonna run you should come out of the house she does I'm pretty sure she does I'm going in I'm going in whoa what what did you call me you weirdo bro where is her dress man wait you know I'm assuming that like what what is this Oh can I eat the cake yo what am I supposed to do with this hang on I'm assuming I know what to do with this thing let's look at the hints here she has a picture taken in the dress no kidding find the dress upstairs okay I guess that's helpful but it doesn't okay what you know what I just wasted stars on that nice it's upstairs so I figured that okay all right I see that paper so okay she's doing her makeups she's gonna mustache actually dude could be here no how about here oh I found it okay cut it up maybe yes oh she's gonna be so mad which way is she coming though I don't know jeez what happened oh oh dude this is okay huh Oh Jase I did not expect to see myself in the mirror um I'm adorable hair remover what why does she have here that's for her mustache I told you guys she does have a mustache she uses hair remover on it okay what else she got sweet what am i doing ah I would have lit it on fire and burn your house down but we'll do all right one more prank place a pin on the sofa so that pinches her and enjoy watching her suffer yo okay first of all a pin is going to puncture her and she's gonna bleed all over the place great this this Wow all right this is getting dark okay good for you so is that okay so shitty wait put that inside the cake that's weird okay so she sits on that sofa cushion to drink our tea so let's do so we have to find the pin okay we gotta wait for her to get up I don't think I saw a pin anywhere let's crouch she kono she's going upstairs no I don't need that what we'll figure this out pin I didn't see one in the in that tool shed but that doesn't mean it didn't spawn now cuz that wasn't part of the mission before I don't ring the doorbell oh that's Oh to distract ah nope actually there's the pin right there I think yo that is huge it's gonna like if she sits on that that's gonna go like that's gonna kill her okay let's go put it down put it there cover up the pin to hide it blanket cover it there get out before she okay go go go go go go go go oh this was easy we could probably get to done yeah okay okay she's coming she's coming she's coming goodness I gotta see this I gotta see it all right you got two two cameras oh that's it what secret witch okay mrs. T's evilness knows no bounds set free the poor cat me she locked me up oh I'm saving you kitty cat we're yet oh this is that's not a cat that's like those are like giant Spears what are you talking about okay find out where the cat is locked up well we know where that is I've already found that creepier room oh man can I get through here yeah okay unlock the Chokey what's the Chokey wait a second it sounds like it's here actually and that's not yo it's oh hey so wait she was it a completely different robos doesn't open the door pick up the cat hey kitty dude this thing's like a tiger

the largest smartest and most expensive 3d printers i've ever reviewed on the channel this machine has automatic functions for almost everything and with two independent extruders a sheet metal chassis and removable print surface it has the makings of the perfect 3d printer but is it well let's get started [Music] how's it going guys angus here from makers muse we're here in my garage because well this printer is so gigantic that there's literally no chance i would get it into the studio i know many of you have been waiting patiently for this review but truthfully the review process for this 3d printer has been one of the most difficult i've ever done on the channel and has literally taken months of testing so a thumbs up on the video and a sub to the channel would be really appreciated it's free and it helps me out hugely let's start on the specs this machine is huge no doubt about it but the flow series come in several flavors both idexx versions have around 425 millimeters and 250 millimeters in y depending on the printing configuration and 250 millimeters in the z which is double to 500 millimeters in z for this monster the idex xl there's also the single extruded variant flow and the flow xl which have slightly different print volumes and lose the idex functionality but overall carried the same interface and features construction is incredibly robust with a chassis being made from sheet metal and heavy duty motion components i'm not sure why they only went with linear rods for why when x has fast superior linear rails this is a step back from the previous gen idex craftbot 3 but at least it has rails and a nice big ball screw for that huge cantilevered z-axis this machine's party trick is the idex system with two extruders which move independently on the x-axis linear rail and you can use them in a number of ways such as dual color printing printing a different support material or more inventive approaches such as mirror or parallel 3d printing or a firm favorite recovery mode you might be thinking well to do that kind of thing this machine needs some kind of sensors and man does it have sensors in fact this 3d printer is so jammed full of sensors and it offers the most automatic functionality i've literally ever seen in a 3d printer filament monitoring is done using an encoder something we saw on the craftbot 3 last year but it's now integrated into the direct drive all metal hot ends this means it knows if filament jams and not just when it runs out like a basic micro switch sensor would i'm happy to announce that mesh bed leveling is finally making an appearance on a craftbot 3d printer and have used a genuine bl touch here along with a complex automatic routine to sample several points across the bed at two discrete printing temps which is important because this huge aluminium plate will expand enough to disrupt first layer heights between pla and abs printing temperatures without compensation main bed leveling is done using the traditional three screws and it's manual yes but the machine touches off and tells you how much to rotate each nut and when it's dialed in the last time i saw something similar to this was in the zortrax line of printers but i will say the automatic routine it moves to the point and then waits for you continuously touching off to move the dial and initially i didn't realize it was waiting for me it was not really an indication to say come to the printer i need attention so some kind of notification to say hey i need your intervention now to level these screws would be handy because i thought the machine was just going to do it all on its own to be honest calibrating idex is also a user nightmare because you have to align both extruders in x y and z axes and to do it manually is incredibly tedious as i found out during my review of the copy master 300 v2 however instead of guesswork this machine uses cutouts on the spring steel print bed to locate where the nozzles are and for leveling the nozzle zed height it has screws in the side of extruder 2 which you can then loosen and move it up and down by the design of the shroud makes accessing them seem like a complete afterthought honestly it's probably the most unclear part of the whole calibration process despite craftbot having some quite good tutorial videos when you first get this machine there's actually a wizard to step you through all of these calibration steps one by one and then once you do all of that and you have the machine dulled in you won't have to do it again unless you move the machine or update its firmware and during the process of testing updating this firmware was something i was doing quite a lot but let's talk about that touch screen since 2015 and my review of the craftbot plus i have loved the responsiveness of craftbot's interfaces everything you need is here from file navigation to filament management and a whole array of calibration functions and diagnostic tools it's such a responsive display it should come as no surprise that the flow xl and flow series in general runs a complete custom control board with 32-bit architecture it has internal storage alongside usb storage as well as an iot integration and a built-in camera yes you can wirelessly control this bad boy over network and watch the print in progress it's the ultimate lazy makers tool first you have to log into the wireless 3d printer's interface and then find that printer's ip and access it from another computer on the same network from there you get this interface where you can upload or download g-code and other files it can even do a time-lapse using the webcam if you like you can start or stop prints preheat and go into the webcam and monitor the prints in real time while doing long prints for the night this feature has been amazing i just would log in and take a look to ensure things are going well and not failed now just go about my day i even got the machine hooked up to a cheap iot mains relay so i can power the whole thing up completely remotely and then start a print i don't even have to come down here it's amazing i didn't used to care too much about wi-fi support because it's often buggy and difficult to implement but this is definitely one of the more useful implementations i've come across so then the user experience is clearly superb the build quality is fantastic so the printing must be fantastic as well right well mostly here's the thing craftbot has shoved so much smarts into this machine that sometimes it comes back to bite them this is the second craftbot flow xl that i've been sent for review yeah because the first was full of issues beyond weird firmware and sensor glitches that machine ended up having two loose motor pulleys with no clear way to access them and i did offer to repair it but i in my corresponds to craftbot it turns out by the time i discovered this the problem had been fixed they'd change things yeah haven't heard that one before after an immense saga and a lot of support from rick at fuse3d who's craftbot's australian reseller this printer finally arrived and i restarted my testing basically from square one i feel craftbot tried to rush the initial printer out to beat covet restrictions but it didn't really pan out for them with serious qc issues and unfortunately i know for a fact that wasn't an isolated case judging by their facebook group other people have encountered weird issues and joel telling on his recent unboxing of this machine uh had a faulty extruder cooling fan on the right side out of the box which could have happened in shipping who knows but either way this is a huge printer so you can't exactly just send it back to hungary or some poor reseller to fix it's not a cheap machine either so it should arrive working and you shouldn't have to expect to tink with it out of the box either way i did say i wouldn't base my review conclusions on that machine but rather this one so how does this updated 3d printer perform it's mostly really quite good let's start with single material prints and well you've been seeing this machine in action for the past few months in almost every project i've done on the channel the parrot puzzles custom sd drawer for my desk headphones holder and tons more were prototyped and printed on this machine with flawless results and reliability the ability for me to cad and then send and observe the print all while staying in the studio has proven incredibly valuable to me and for single color prints at least the machine has been very reliable using provided presets in craftware which is craftbot's own slicer when prints are done you don't have to hack at the print bed but instead just remove it and flex the parts off the printer uses an immense spring steel sheet with pei and it works perfectly for pla for petg you need a generous coating of glue stick but my smallish tests printed fine from factory though this machine is far too open to expect reliable large petg prints or especially abs prints but craftbot do supply aftermarket covers and a hat to keep the ambient temperature up which should help quite a bit though i'm not able to test its effectiveness the machine was able to clear all the way down to 0.15 millimeter gaps on my clearance gauge direct on the pei which is incredible and the surface quality is in general superb and uh did i mention how quiet it is seriously like i'm filming right next to it considering how loud the old craft bots used to be this would be impossible and this thing is almost like a ghost depending on how fast you print you could almost work in the same room as this machine but the curiously aggressive acceleration curves on the movement axes do tend to vibrate the machine quite a lot and it's this aggressive acceleration that can also induce ghosting or rigging artifacts on prints so i'll be looking at dialing that back in future but this machine has two extruders not one and they bring several possibilities to the table some of them very usable some of them downright terrible let's let's start with my favorite parallel printing mode in this mode the print bed is roughly halved and the second extruder copies exactly the movement of the first allowing you to effectively print two models in the time it would take to print one for the stuff i do with my prototyping this is mega handy as i can cut down my printing time dramatically on the same machine there's also mirror mode which is effectively the same but it just mirrors the axes i don't really see the value of that compared to parallel other than how visually trippy it is it's more of a party trick in my opinion another mode worth getting to know is redundancy which i mentioned earlier in the video but that reduces your print volume slightly but turns the second extruder into a spare ready to jump in and take over should the first extruder fail if you like the printer can also send you an alert if something happens which is pretty handy and the print bed is so massive that honestly the chance of something happening like a filament roll rolling running out or a jam occurring is quite high so this feature alone could pay for itself if you intend to make massive prints on this 3d printer but what about the main use for dual extruders dual color or dual material printing well like the craftbot 3 i reviewed last year getting any kind of decent multi-color prints of this machine has been a huge battle i've thrown so many test models at this printer using a range of slices and settings and it's taken a lot of my time but here's the thing the issues aren't really the fault of the hardware craftware the slicer made by craftbot just isn't good at slicing for dual color i cannot understand why there's not a good default profile that takes advantage of the idex nature of this printer with those wipers instead the default profile makes the machine try to print a cylindrical purge tower at blindingly fast speeds which is inevitably knocked over and ruins the print why well as the extruders are parked they just ooze and ooze and ooze filament and this isn't uncommon all hot ends will do this but it does mean it takes ages for the extruder to catch up again and start extruding properly this leads to underextruded parts in the purge tower which causes it to break in half or under extruded parts in the model or both there are settings to mitigate this in your header you can put g code for tool exit retracts and primes as well as a pre-change extrusion which should take advantage of the wipers but i found them all to be buggy and ineffective so like with the craftbot 3 it seems most users are resorting to using simplify 3d for their printing needs especially dual color which sucks because you're spending so much on a printer the supplied software should handle all functions and do it well i literally have a pile of test models but here are my best three examples of flowalistics dual color pikachu at 150 scale sliced with craftware simplify 3d and a completely custom process slicer profile i put together with the help of a friend i had to use all sorts of tweaks and tricks and hacks to make them work out of all of them i like the prusa slicer profile the best which does a purge correctly but sometimes the dice get pulled over into the print and leave ruined parts so it's still not perfect okay while i was editing and got a haircut a new firmware for the craftbot flow was made available and this firmware was supposedly going to fix a lot of the issues i was experiencing with dual color so i had to go back and test and look it has fixed some things here's a great example of a slightly larger dual color pikachu that i did with the default settings in craftware and it actually worked incredibly well but there's still under extrusion problems going on and in another print i tried the purge tower did in fact break free and ruin the print and the pre-change extrusion you can set in craftware doesn't always occur i'm not exactly sure what's happening there sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't it seems to be quite buggy still so i wanted to be really thorough this video the latest firmware has allowed me to get some really good dual color prints but it still has a way to go okay it's pretty clear i'm unhappy with my dual color results across the board but the single extruder prints are really really good when this printer is fed good g-code it produces great results now i know craftbot has been rolling out constant firmware updates to this printer during testing so i implore them to do the same for their slicer and their provided slicing profiles right well i think it's conclusion time i feel this printer is about 95 there craftbot has created one of the smartest 3d printers i've ever reviewed on the channel but it has not been without its issues and i know for a fact i'm not alone in suffering these weird annoying glitches quality control issues and what in what is otherwise a fantastic experience there's just so many sensors in it like if you forget to put the build plate in it tells you there's a collision it tells you which is great but when you add so much stuff more things can go wrong and things did go wrong but they are getting better which is great to see but i'm not going to lie it's so disappointing to be let down by what is essentially software craftware hasn't really changed that much from what i can see since 2015 when i did my slicer shootout and i really liked it then because it had customizable supports but the 3d printing landscape has changed so much since then i just really don't think it's acceptable to rely on also outdated overpriced software like simplify 3d which is why i push so hard to get a pressure slicer profile working and i'll leave these these profiles i've created in the video description by the way if you'd like to try them out but if you don't care about dual color or dual material functionality then you're probably better off just getting the single extruder flow variants which are cheaper because i really have been happy with this performance printing single color models i do really enjoy parallel printing mode but the cost jump isn't really justifiable if you only want to use that mode because of how tedious this review process has been i haven't tried swapping nozzles but it's important to note that with a 0.4 millimeter nozzle that the machine comes with from factory utilizing the full 500 millimeter zed height could easily take days and that's why i haven't done giant prints but i will be swapping to a 0.8 millimeter nozzle for some massive future projects and i'll let you know how that goes by the way these nozzles are proprietary the whole hot end assembly is their own design but they're fairly reasonably priced and you can even get hard nozzles if you want to print with abrasives speaking of the extruders and nozzles i know that joel over at 3d printing node has also received on these machines to review so when his review comes out he'll have a bit of a bit more of an insight into that side of this printer because there's just so much to cover so i'll put a link to below and also here to check out his review when it comes out because it's really important to get different perspectives on machines especially ones this expensive um because yeah how expensive is this well are you sitting down the craftbot flow series starts at 2 600 euro for the single extruder 3 300 euro or 5 280 australian dollars plus gst for the idex and four thousand euro or six thousand six hundred and thirty six dollars australian plus gst for this big daddy the flow idex xl yeah look it ain't no end to three for sure but it isn't even in the same league this printer arrives on a huge palette needs two people minimum to move around and it might just be the machine you're after for your school college or design studio or the ultimate home maker space i just hope they nail down some better printing profiles asap a big thanks to craftbot for working with me through this somewhat delayed review and rick of fuse 3d the australian reseller for craftbot who you should definitely hit up if you're after one down under links are in the video description as always here on makey's music's review has been my own opinion and it hasn't been paid for hasn't been given approval this is the release that you're seeing it's the same that craftbot's going to see as well i do get to hold on to the machine for future projects though so i do have some plans because it's so huge so if you want to check those out maybe consider subscribing because here on makerspace is my aim to empower your creativity through technology and i look forward to seeing you again very shortly thanks for watching guys bye", "M3SMUpNH_6I": "- Not everyone has the\ncashola to shell out on a fancy 3D printer. And even relatively basic\nhome enthusiast ones can still cost hundreds or\neven thousands of dollars. Or at least, they did. Feast your eyes on the Easythreed X1, a sub $100 3D printer, straight to you from Shenzhen, China. It moves, it extrudes,\nsometimes it goofs up. But it has basically zero\ncompetition in this price bracket, so we absolutely needed\nto take a look at it. Just like I need to tell\nyou about our sponsor. Storyblocks videos\nsaves you time and money with studio quality stock video clips for a fraction of the cost. Check it out today at the\nlink in the video description. (upbeat music) (electronic beeping) I know what you're thinking because I was thinking\nthe exact same thing. This thing has to be\na hot pile of garbage. But hold on for a second. Even if it is hot garbage, you have to appreciate that hitting such a low price point while delivering something\nthat functions at all is pretty impressive. There are multiple injection-molded parts, each one requiring a\ncostly tool to manufacture and it even comes 99% preassembled. There's clearly a lot of\nvalue for your money here, as long as you temper your expectations. The accessory package\nincludes what you need and absolutely nothing more, you get a small screw driver, a few meters of PLA filament, a card reader and microSD card preloaded with manuals, software, and a test print file, and finally a 12-volt\n2.5 Amp power supply. The X1 gets away with such a\nwimpy power supply, by the way, because there is no heated print bed but that means that you're\nonly able to print in PLA as most other plastics will have bad adhesion and warping issues without a heating bed, which is fine. I mean, we can't recommend\nPLA for anything structural but for decorative prints, single-use widgets or toys, it gets the job done just fine, that is as long as it's a\ndecent quality filament. Out of the gate, the included G-code file\nproduced this little cat model and there is a lot that\nwe can learn from this. The stringing between\nthe ears and the tail tells us that while the\nX1's hot and cooling fan seems to be working, the lack of a part cooling fan, so one that helps solidify the plastics after it's been extruded, means that the printer ends up either dragging material\nalong with the nozzle or printing on top of\nsemi-liquid material, There's also visible porosity along the perimeters of the model that tells us that our filament\nis not extruding evenly. Now initially, we blamed the printer\nfor this, understandably, but upon closer inspection\nof the included filament, we discovered that it is complete garbage. The diameter of this small\nlength of the starter filament varies by over 0.3 millimeters\nfrom one end to the other. To put that in context, most manufacturers strive to\nkeep it under 0.05 millimeters across an entire spool like this one. The good news is that once we switched to some decent filament, the print quality actually\nimproved dramatically. It's still not great, especially side by side against prints that are coming\nout of our Ultimaker 3 Plus, but it's in line with our expectations given the price point and I think we can do even better. So from here out, we're gonna be making our\nown G-code using a slicer which takes our 3D model and slices it, hence the name, into multiple 2D layers that are laid down in order\nto make the 3D shapes we want. Now Easythreed did\ninclude their own slicer called Easyware which\nuses the Unity engine. Yes, that Unity engine\nfrom \"Escape from Tarkov,\" so that's neat. And it functions just fine\nwith the default settings, but the menu is a bit\nunwieldy and for some reason the settings list kept\nscrolling itself upward. So after one test print of our LTT logo, which I have right here, sort of holding together still. We made the decision to move to a slicer, that Colin, our writer for this video, was more familiar with. That's Prusa Slicer which actually ended up making things worse rather than better, believe it or not. Too much material was being extruded and the nozzle was too\nlow on the first layer, dragging itself around in the PLA. After iterating half a dozen times though and moving to a slightly larger coin, mostly just to help with the part cooling so that it's not going\nover the exact same spot that's still liquid right away, we actually started to see\nsome half-decent results. Now we've still got some infill and perimeter blending issues, which was a little surprising given the up to 30% overlap that we tried, but overall big gains were made and we felt like the X1 was\nready to take on Benchy. The Benchy benchmark model is an excellent trial\nprint for a few reasons, one, it contains nearly every\ndifficult 3D printing feature, like curved overhangs,\ntiny surface details, long curved perimeters, and both small and slanted holes. For comparison, this blue one here is printed\non our Ultimaker 3 Plus. You can check out our full\nreview on that printer in the card up here. Now it's not perfect. There's a bit of weird patterning\nin the vertical surfaces but it has nice crisp\nedges with no stringing, and its bridged sections are pretty good considering that there's no\nsupport structure included. Most of these issues\ncan really be attributed to the lack of tuning and our fast print speed. Compared to the X1s, it's easy to see which\nmachine did the better job. Oh, by the way, we didn't mention this but it comes with a magnetic print bed. Mind you, it's kind of ruined already from just a dozen prints. But anyway, with more dialing in, we probably could get\nbetter results than this, particularly on the\nunder-extruded sections but the results here are as expected. Our solid infill is still under-extruded which means that even after\nthe tuning we've done so far, there's more time we would need to invest in order to improve print reliability. These hanging bits under the roof here, indicate both a lack of speed and cooling. We see a similar problem in\nthe undersides of the archways and as for the smokestack on the top, that turned into a hot gooey blob. And this is an example of\nfine detail print problems that you simply cannot fix by slowing down the printhead because it can't solidify with\nthe hot end so close to it. Now there are some files out there to hack a cooling fan onto this printer, and actually a heated\nbed while you're at it. But this isn't the printer to buy if you're trying to do even a moderate amount of 3D printing. It's an ultra low buck starter machine, designed to fit onto a bookshelf or in a dorm room closet along with all of your\nshirts from LLTStore.com. If all you wanted was\nsomething to tinker with, and if you can manage to\nmake a bath toy or two for your kid, so much the better. Well it works, which is actually more than we expected for under $100. But if you want consistency and plug and play operation, it's worth the money\nto grab something like a Monoprice Mini which comes in at 219 or if you can swing it, a Prusa Mini.

creality cr30 otherwise known as naomi wu's 3d print mill and no the title isn't click bait nor is the thumbnail this machine turns filament-based 3d printing on its head quite literally and as a result it's capable of some incredible feats these radical design changes however also result in new limitations and obstacles to overcome so in this video we'll be checking out the cr30 and covering what you might expect should you decide to get one let's get started to begin i'd like to get three things out of the way first this machine is a pre-production unit sent to me free of charge from creality for purpose of review and testing because secondly you can currently back this machine on kickstarter kickstarter is a route to market i personally don't agree with especially from such a large company like reality due to many campaigns in the past failing to deliver but this machine is unique enough to justify a crowdfunding campaign i suppose to gauge market appeal but if you decide to back this printer to lock in the lower kickstarter price you do so at your own risk and it's not my fault if anything goes wrong kickstarter is not a store finally and this might be a bit of a surprise to some but this is not the first 3d printer of its kind in fact the cr30s development wouldn't have been possible without a collaboration between creality naomi wu and carl the creator of the white knight belt printer a fully open source 3d printer from which this machine shares a lot of dna it'd also be remiss to not mention the black belt 3d printer a commercial belt printer which has already been on the market for some time and was the original inspiration for carl's machine even though my review unit is pre-production it came impeccably packed with decent instructions all i had to do was attach the core xy head unit to the base and fasten in place the two supporting arms which gives this machine incredible strength this machine is huge and dense compared to something like a cr10 and it feels very well engineered i don't keep packaging for 3d printers but i just had to keep this little bit of history look it's naomi on the box i love it if you're familiar with creality then many of the components and design choices here should be familiar the printer is engineered from v slot aluminum extrusion with v rollers for x and y and the hot end is identical to an end of three save for a variation in the cooling ducts it takes 1.75 millimeter filament driven by this metal bowden extruder but damn is that bowden tube long like it's not as long as the button tubes on the b2x 300 but it's long enough that it needs some mighty retract settings and some filaments may be a bit stringy or hard to manage depending on your settings and what you're trying to do the interface is a standard clicky wheel lcd nothing to write home about here and the printer itself is running silent stepper drivers and a 32-bit control board from creality so let's move on to the biggest and most obvious design feature that belt the belt assembly on the cr-30 is immense and hugely over-engineered but it kind of has to be the belt is under incredible tension to keep it as flat as possible and to drive it the machine uses a stepper motor through geared reduction and a final belt reduction the print belt is supported in the print area by a heated aluminium plate and then further down with another plate and finally there's this little guard at the front on the idler side where the prints peel off as the belt advances keeping this belt running true with correct tension and first layer accuracy is everything on this 3d printer yep just when you thought you'd become a master at leveling your bed on more traditional 3d printers this thing comes along with no less than eight points of adjustment which you have to get right if you want your prints to succeed for belt level you have these four leveling points though they're supposed to come level from factory so you shouldn't really have to touch them but for first layer height you have to adjust the z-axis optical end stop and find a good level through basically trial and error you hone the machine each time and complete test prints until you're happy with how much the first layer is dug into that print belt finally you have the actual belt tension and in my unit the print belt and timing belt was so tight that the print motor was overheating and losing steps on longer prints adjusting the front tension points also plays a role in the belt's tracking if it's tracked straight or it bumps up against the side walls which also affects the print quality and the smallest imperfection here will cause the belt to slowly migrate left or right in my tests i found that this print surface sticks prints down very well but they have a very rough surface and the black coating is coming with each successive print this belt however won't be the same as the ones shipped in production units as naomi is already on the case they're changing it but in her words you've got to review what's there so here it is with general construction out of the way we can take a closer look at that incredibly unusual axis configuration the print volume of the cr30 is 200 millimeters by 170 millimeters by theoretically infinite in the z-axis this machine isn't infinitely tall what am i talking about well in this case the z-axis is the belt and the y-axis runs at this 45 degree slant resulting in a total possible height of 170 millimeters it's actually not all that big really smaller than an end of three in two directions but how infinite zed can you really print with this machine well carl put his pre-production unit through its paces and printed an i-beam a ridiculous six meters long continuously you can check out his time-lapse here it really is quite trippy to watch he even put the gopro on the beam as was printing and for printing ready long prints you do need to support them as they start to sag unsupported but creality does have a roller attachment you can use and it's sold separately so what that means is this printer can produce models significantly longer than itself continuously and the eyes of prop makers all around the world light up in 2014 i figured out how to rip game assets from skyrim and 3d printed a daedric dagger in three parts on my very small 3d print at the time which i had to glue together afterwards however this statrix sword is one meter long and it was 3d printed in two parts on the cr30 this is just one half it took 19 hours to complete but thanks to the miracles of editing you can see the finished sword here and what's more you could also do them sequentially without intervention because each print reaches the end of the belt and they naturally detach and fall off i'm not one to use the term killer app lightly but yeah for any kind of cosplay work swords staffs armor and the like this machine was born to do it and it wouldn't take much finishing at all to bring the sword up to scratch and a heck of a lot less finishing required than printing it in six or more slices you can of course also choose to print regular sized objects one after another as the belt rolls forward the previously completed models eventually detach and you could catch them in a wedding part spin beneath there's no functional limit to how long you could run the printer like this churning out parts however currently the size of the g-code file you use i feel would be the limiting factor what i would love to see in future is some kind of integration with a print server which automatically slices and prints incoming models because that would be sweet however it isn't all sunshine and lollipops as groundbreaking as this 3d printer is there's some quite severe compromises made to give it this ability they mostly come from the unusual 45 degree angle at which the core xy assembly sits and as such the angle at which 3d prints are sliced when you think about a standard filament-based 3d printer with z-axis going vertically a 3d prints first layer is the base of that model and it builds up layer by layer in zed until the print is complete each extruded line is supported by the one below it and you can get away with a certain amount of what's called overhang roughly 45 degrees or so before it becomes too extreme for the layers of molten plastic to hold their shape and the print starts looking bad or fails entirely okay so got that well now throw all that information out the window because this 3d printer plays by a whole new set of rules okay yes the roughly 45 degree overhang capability is still there but due to that tilt it means that a vertical wall facing the z direction when you start printing is roughly the steepest overhang this machine is capable of in that axis that means that with popular test models like the benchy the bow looks horrible even the slight angle on the rear of the boat is too severe this machine simply can't reproduce it it's trying to lay filament in mid-air in fact details designers often add to models to make them print better such as a 45 degree chamfer on the underside of parts results in the printer attempting to print basically in mid-air because each layer makes contact with a bed sequentially at that angle yeah the rules change though depending on the axis for example x seems to have the same overhang capability as regular 3d printers but it's when you're facing the other direction in zed that things become really strange this print looks like it should be impossible but for this printer it's a cakewalk the machine isn't attempting to print a beam with one huge bridge at once but instead in small 45-degree slices which self-support gravity will definitely have some effect i suspect very long horizontal sections where it may suffer some sag but years ago i tried inverting a 3d printer and found that gravity had a negligible effect on overhangs negligible that's that's i can't speak also keep in mind that the print service isn't all that stable so that will also limit how far you can push these unsupported 90 degree uh overhangs all of creality's test prints are clearly aware of these limitations going so far as to arrange a scaled-up benchy on this ridiculous angled block to make it print properly but it really does print models better at these weird orientations which is frustrating because almost none of my usual testing models are suitable at least not without significant geometry changes except it seems the gay or anderson cat normally you would have to support the cat's head as this is a significant overhang but not here and to top it all off this print is entirely hollow as a result there's a few gaps in the surface but overall the finish is great at 0.15 millimeter layers all things considered some models it seems almost by chance are better suited for the cr30 but most models will not print properly and will need significant geometric or orientation changes by the way joel also shares his thoughts on these geometric limitations in his video which you should definitely check out here as you can probably imagine slicing for a 3d printer like this is also completely new and currently the only options rely on heavily modified cura it really does feel like stepping back in time when 3d printing slices were a buggy hot mess initially i was using crowley's provided slicer but i wasn't getting great prints so i moved to the black belt version with a modified profile from carl and it's working quite well all things considered but it has a long way to go and it's really conservative with only a 35 millimeter per second print speed in the slicer geometry of certain internal angles tends to get ignored and you can't do support from build plate only which would be really handy for quickly angling existing models to that 45 degree sweet spot to become suitable for this machine and i know that slicing technology will only get better for this kind of setup but i do really hope that it happens quickly and for example i'd love like prusa to step in with a prusa slicer integration in future because that would be awesome okay conclusion time again this is a pre-production unit from creality which they're currently crowdfunding what you get will differ from this machine because they're constantly tweaking and improving the design but even at this stage it does feel quite polished the possibility of printing objects longer than the printer itself is absolutely going to be enough for many people to pick up one of these and the kickstarter price of around 700 us makes that added functionality a no-brainer for prop shops and cosplay enthusiasts however this is not a baby's first 3d printer there's no way i could recommend a machine like this as specialized as this as your first or only 3d printer it has complex calibration and tensioning to master and those geometric limitations which will require an intimate knowledge of 3d modeling to overcome if you're brand new to 3d printing i would recommend just pick up an end of three or similar for 200 bucks have some fun and then when you're ready come back to this because even at the 1k usd retail price it's going to be a steal compared to other options when you consider the functionality it does offer lastly i want to touch on the incredible work naomi has done orchestrating the existence of this machine in collaboration with carl and creality carl's bell printer the white knight is fully open sourced already but naomi has put a bounty on this printer becoming fully open sourced as well if the kickstarter campaign reaches five million dollars in funding not sure it's gonna get there but it'll be pretty cool if it does and also naomi has put so much on the line to bring this machine into existence i mean her face is on the box and she constantly fights dumb decisions out of her control so while crowley has made mistakes i want to say thank you naomi for looking out for the community as you always have done you can find out more info on the cr-30 the naomi wu 3d printer mill in the description below and if you found this video useful maybe consider subscribing because this is certainly not the last you'll see of this printer on this channel what's really cool is when new tech like this starts becoming affordable and accessible that's when we start seeing people discovering really interesting new ways to push it and i really look forward to that future thanks for watching guys bye", "tegG2FvLWWY":

that 3D printing was still way too hard to get into and that finding the knowledge\nthat everyone seems to be taking for granted these days can be kinda hard to piece together. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to fix with this\nvideo series. Welcome to the basics course on 3D printing! We\u2019ve got 10 episodes coming up that will\nhelp you understand how 3D printers works, what the fancy terminology means everyone\u2019s\nthrowing around, what to look for in a machine if you\u2019re considering getting one yourself\nand, of course, how the printing process works. If you\u2019ve heard of 3D printing and are maybe\nthinking about getting a machine for yourself or have already picked one up, then this series\nis for you. But if you\u2019ve already gotten started, I\nthink you\u2019ll still get some good info out of it. This series is free for everyone to watch,\nthere\u2019s no paywall, this isn\u2019t a free sample for a longer course I\u2019m trying to\nsell you somewhere, this entire thing is just up here on YouTube. It\u2019s the biggest video project I\u2019ve worked\non and I want to thank all of you who are subscribed to the channel or are even supporting\nmy work directly through Patreon or YouTube memberships, without you, I wouldn\u2019t be\nable to produce this series and just put it up on YouTube. And also, we\u2019ve got a few partners onboard\nfor the series, they have been providing materials and sponsorships, so thank you to all the\ncompanies supporting this project as well, you\u2019ll hear more about them as we move on. One note for the entire series: Instead of\ndoing a boring lecture-like approach, I\u2019m instead focusing on one subject for each video\n- that means, you can watch them out of order and just focus on the bits you\u2019re interested\nin, but you can also jump to other video explaining some bits in more detail if we\u2019re moving\nat a pace that\u2019s a bit too fast for you. So, let\u2019s get into it. Okay, let\u2019s get started with the most basic\nthing of all: What is a 3D printer? I just want to make sure we\u2019re all talking\nabout the same thing here. The textbook - Wikipedia - says it\u2019s a machine\nthat produces three-dimensional parts using an additive, layer-based process. That makes a lot of sense - to me. So, let me break it down, three things in\nhere that really define what is a 3D printer and what is not: Three-dimensional, additive,\nlayer-based. Three-dimensional means that you can make\nparts that are more than just a flat geometry. If you have a 2D printer, you\u2019re adding\nink or toner onto a perfectly flat sheet of paper; and cutting out contours from flat\nmaterial like paper, aluminum or plastic gives you, technically, a part with some thickness,\nbut it\u2019s still only got that 2D shape, but now a bit thicker. A 3D printer can also make those flat parts,\nbut its unique feature is that it can have details practically anywhere on a part, in\nany orientation. This is how these parts came off the printer,\nand that\u2019s the three-dimensional part. Next, \u201cadditive\u201d. If you want to make anything, really, there\nare two basic ways of creating it. Additive and subtractive. Let\u2019s say you want to bake cupcakes, what\nyou do is you start with an empty bowl and add in your ingredients, one by one, until\nyou have your finished batter. That\u2019s an additive process. What you could also do is to buy a cake and\nthen cut away everything that doesn\u2019t look like a cupcake. Also works, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how\nyou typically make cupcakes. That would be a subtractive process, you start\nwith something larger than what you need and remove everything that\u2019s in the way. The subtractive equivalent for making 3D parts\nwould be something like manual wood carving or CNC milling or laser cutting, where you\nshave away at your material stock until only your finished part is left. But 3D printing is additive: The two common\nways of printing parts that are relevant for the machines you are most certainly going\nto be looking at are either filament- or resin-based, where the machine takes your raw material\nand, for example for filament printers, melts it down and uses that to add on material until\nwhat you have looks like the part you want. And that brings us to the last part, layers. Now, there are some approaches in 3D printing\nthat blur the lines of whether that process is actually using layers or not, but generally,\na 3D printing process will slice a model into fine layers and then print those one on top\nof the other, from the bottom up. The printer knows very little about what it\u2019s\nactually printing, and at most, it\u2019s only seeing parts of a single, two-dimensional\nlayer at a time. For a filament machine, it\u2019s getting all\nthe paths along which it needs to lay down material in each layer, then it moves up a\nbit and starts working on a fresh set of moves for this new layer that it\u2019s now printing\non top of the old one. Resin machines are similar, but the common\nones actually project light into the resin tank, which cures the resin in all the spots\nwhere you want to end up with a part and block out the light anywhere where there should\nbe no cured material in the final part at all. We\u2019ll have a closer look at resin printers\nin episode 3 of this series, they\u2019re a great type of machine for special applications,\nbut I think starting on a filament-based machine is a way better choice. The parts can still be very detailed, but\nthe process is much safer, less messy and it\u2019s an approach you can actually watch\nwhile it\u2019s happening instead of looking into a black box and then miraculously having\na part appear a few hours later. Want a few examples? Cool. The Prusa Mini: Makes three-dimensional parts,\ncheck. Additive process, check. Layers, check. This is a 3D printer. Resin printers, like the SL1 or Mars: Check,\ncheck, check. Cupcake decorating: Uhm, I guess it\u2019s three-dimensional,\nthough really it\u2019s just a single 2D layer you lay down, Additive, yes; layers, definitely. So I guess, kind of a 3D printer? But typically, it\u2019s a machine controlling\nthe process, not a human. A \u201c3D laser printer\u201d - commonly known\nas a lasercutter. Three-dimensional: Nope. Additive: Nope. Layers: Nope. Who exactly had the idea of calling these\n\u201c3D laser printers\u201d? An injection molding machine does make 3D\nparts, but it\u2019s lacking the \u201clayer\u201d component, and 2D, like, paper printers are\nmissing the \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d part, obviously. Ok, so I think we\u2019re on the same page when\nit come to what sort of machines we\u2019re actually talking about. So what do we use them for? This is, I think, one of the most important\nbits when it comes to how you look at 3D printers. Of course, you\u2019ve all seen the trinkets\nand flower pots and pretty things you can just download and print, and if that\u2019s all\nyou want to use a 3D printer for, that\u2019s fine! But as we\u2019ve recently seen with printed\nfaceshield brackets for healthcare workers, 3D printers are able to make parts that are\nmore than just nice to look at. With how capable and just, you know, ready\nto perform at any time even the simpler machines have become, I think we\u2019re at that point\nwhere we can really look at a 3D printer just like at any other tool, like, I don\u2019t know,\na Skilsaw or something, where it\u2019s really less about the machine itself, but more about\nbeing able to use it well enough and then making use of that machine, with the nitty-gritty\ndetails of the process itself kind of getting out of the way. You don\u2019t need to know to wind the motor\ncoils in a skilsaw or how to engineer the bearing in order to be able to make a good\ncut with it. Much of what I try to do here on the channel\nis making use of 3D printers and other sorts of digital fabrication tools as just that\n- a tool. But that\u2019s not to say that getting into\n3D printing as a hobby and because you\u2019re interested in the tech and how it all works\ntogether, that that wouldn\u2019t be a legitimate use. It\u2019s just a different one, and going into\n3D printing, you should be very aware of whether you\u2019re looking for a tool or a hobby. And actually, one really cool thing you can\ndo with 3D printers is making more 3D printers. Yeah, yeah, I know, that a bit of a meme,\nbut that\u2019s actually how this all got started. In fact, if you look at these two machines,\nyou can still see that they\u2019re also made of 3D printed parts. Some people prefer designs that make use of\nbent sheet metal and injection molded plastic instead, but I think having at least a few\n3D printed parts is actually a good thing for a printer. The first machines of this style were called\n\u201cRepRap\u2019s\u201d, and their goal was actually to manufacture as many parts for the next\niteration of printers on the current machines they had, and then using common material for\neverything that couldn\u2019t be printed. So of course, the printed parts would include\nall these frame parts, but also, circuit boards using markers to draw on the traces, printed\npulleys for the belts, there are even projects that print the stepper motors that drive these\nmachines, or just the entire printer frame. And that allowed these machines to progress\nfrom expensive, complicated monstrosities to machines that cost maybe a fifth of what\nthe first ones cost and are much more capable and reliable - in not even 10 years. I built one of the early ones, and it was\npretty rough. The other part to why these machines were\nable to progress so fast is because so many people are sharing the effort they put into\nimproving the designs as open-source, so that everyone else would be able to learn from\nwhat they did, and if anyone like a specific design, they would be able to simply use that\nprevious work for their own designs. These two printers and a bunch of others are\nopen-source, which means anyone can grab of a copy of the mechanical design files, the\nsoftware that runs on the printer, electronics designs, everything is available for others\nto use and learn from. Unfortunately, we\u2019re seeing more and more\nclosed-source designs that not only make it harder to see how the features of that machine\nwere created, but it also makes it harder for the community to work on those machines\nand share improvements with everyone else. That\u2019s kind of a dead end, just like when\na manufacturer just grabs open-source software, uses it for their purpose, claims they\u2019re\n\u201cpowered by open-source\u201d, but then doesn\u2019t share back what they did. But going into detail on that would be way\ntoo much for this video, it\u2019s just something you should be aware of to understand what\ngot 3D this far. So, let\u2019s recap! A 3D printer makes parts by adding material\nin layers, and what it makes is entirely dependent on what instructions your software sends it. That\u2019s both true for filament and resin\nprinters. And lastly, we have these machines because\ntheir designs and ideas got shared freely as open-source and then improved on, and I\nthink that\u2019s still something that\u2019s worth having, even today. So in the next video we\u2019re going to go through\nwhat you should be looking for in a 3D printer and what to avoid. You can check that video out in the playlist,\nuntil then, thank you for watching, make sure to get subscribed, keep on making, and I\u2019ll\nsee you later.", "k8pIjqWcsjg": "[Music] hello [Music]

at a time by a machine they can be made of plastics or even metals digital construction plans are swiftly brought to life we're in a whole new world now where we're merging software material science a project can move from the drawing board to the finished product with remarkable speed and three-dimensional printers use less material labor and energy as they turn out new designs it allows goods to be produced in lower quantities more often closer to the point of consumption this technology could have the power to revolutionize the flow of goods and the scope of product markets it's disruptive we're destroying the old production methods that were used for decades now we're supposed to use 3d printing 3d was once a method for niche products now it looks set to become a key technology that might even induce industries that have left Germany to come back home [Music] Berlin's quoits burg district is home to a company called big rap which makes large scale 3d printers engineer stefan via founded the company in 2014 now it's 90 employees work in international teams to design and manufacture 3d printers for industrial clients the printing is done with plastic for example to manufacture cladding for houses that regulates the inside temperature based on how high the Sun is this will be part of a facade that's ten by twenty meters the great thing about this cladding is that it reflects sunlight in summer and lets in sunlight during winter which creates a pleasant climate big rap also makes spare parts this is a headrest for passenger train seats if the headrest is missing or broken people are going to be uncomfortable but we can supply a new frame big rep has designed a headrest prototype and is testing it for German railway company deutsche bahn the printer piles thin layers of material on top of each other in this case melted plastic filaments the process is known as additive manufacturing it builds up objects instead of carving them out of a block 3d printing is based on computer models they could be scans of spare parts or entirely new products like this electric motorcycle here the big rep team is building a prototype of the motorcycle that's to go on display two weeks later at the forum next trade fair in Frankfurt I still have a lot of work to do before the forum next we have to get the printers ready and print out lots of parts almost all the bikes parts have come out of the printer including the elastic tires the frame and the lights many components consist of biodegradable plastic made from cornstarch the team needed just 12 weeks to get from the preliminary design sketches to the finished prototype but they're still working out a few bugs the engineers spent a year tinkering with the new printers and now the machines can be installed in a production line and controlled automatically that's an important step towards mass production so far 3d printing has been used mainly for one-off projects the Sicilian the great thing about 3d printing is that we can create parts that used to seem impossible between classical manufacturing processes simply could not work with certain complex geometries such as a furniture or this gripping device for robots which is based on the design of the human finger the device is outfitted with flexible slats that provide a non-slip grip the fascinating thing is that our creative process is completely digital engineers can sit down at the computer and just design something and their imagination is no longer limited by classical production methods such as sawing or milling music or a phrase this revolutionary new concept may well improve the ways that industry designs manufactures and transports its products [Music] Chicago is home to a number of new high-tech companies including fast radius they print components that are precise and durable enough for use in the mechanical engineering industry fast radius often uses plastic resins which allow for faster printing the process looks like something out of a science fiction film the metal foot dips into the resin solution the components solidify on the bottom as if by magic no molds are needed light sources inside the solution ensure that only certain parts Harden and take shape this process makes the product lighter and also uses fewer raw materials the company's co-founder and CEO is Lou Rossi fast radius is working with logistics company ups to completely rethink the concept of supply chains additive manufacturing will have a profound impact on how global supply chains work we call it the fourth modality of logistics in fact what we mean is that through human history we have moved parts in three ways by ground by air and by sea and now we have a fourth mode of transportation and that is moving parts by the Internet at the speed of light digital production offers a tremendous freedom to potential clients a global 3d printing Network can provide products more efficiently transport routes are shorter and there are no huge specialized factories these days 3d printers can make just about anything and robots automatically supervise the assembly lines these machines can print single pieces or entire series of products 24 hours a day but so far 3d printing accounts for only a small percentage of global manufacturing sales which now total about 12 trillion dollars revenues for the 3d printing industry in 2017 were only about seven billion dollars but over the next 10 years sales are expected to reach 100 billion dollars a lot of spare parts are now made by 3d printers companies can simply scan and store the components instead of keeping them for years in warehouses and they can print new parts whenever they need them position how many data points do we get for this part from each scan it's in the millions of points that we're gathering and and now for a part like this millions of points is a little redundant so what happens is the computer itself notices redundancies points break and simplify and then throws away hundreds of thousands of points the scans are stored in a digital facility and can be printed at any time the companies save money because they don't have to keep lots of products in big warehouses and their machines last longer because spare parts are always available one of our clients is an aerospace client they had a need for a critical tool for repair normally it would have taken them 48 days to have the tool fabricated and conventional methods instead they ordered apart from our virtual warehouse and we made the part certified the part and delivered it halfway around the world within 48 hours it's often faster to print a component part than it is to build it from scratch in future this will likely be done on-site this situation threatens to transform the way that logistics companies like UPS do business it would eliminate lengthy transport routes or warehouses for customers spare parts that's why UPS has teamed up with fast radius to start building a global network of 3d print service providers [Music] it allows goods to be produced in lower quantities more often closer to the point of consumption that's going to radically change the supply chain and UPS has to be able to change with it and the and so that's why we're investing in this in this area because we want to be part of this evolving ecosystem many products will no longer be mass-produced they'll be printed individually to meet the specific needs of clients that will help to eliminate overproduction and long transport routes 3d production also offers a number of other advantages if you're producing for an audience of one so a custom shoe or a custom knee or a custom orthotic those are not going to be produced in massive factories it's going to be much more economical to produce those using 3d printing and so but all of those materials still need to get to the 3d manufacturer and instead of you know shipping out you know thousands of things in bulk you're gonna have thousands of individual shipments so to a company like UPS that's very good it might be good for UPS but less so for traffic and the environment it means more trucks delivering more products and emitting more pollution an effect we've already seen with the rise of online shopping and there are other risks for example how can 3d printing companies prevent the manufacture of illegal weapons what we're doing we make sure we screen every company that we're making parts for to ensure that they're not making unregulated firearm yeah vigilance but criminals will always find ways to get the weapons they want homemade firearms are nothing new but today's high quality 3d printing materials can withstand extreme pressure and heat so they could be used to make weapons in 2013 some Israeli reporters used a 3d printer to make a handgun and then tested it just about a headshot later the reporters smuggled the gun into the Israeli Parliament building in Jerusalem the gun had a metal firing pin but security devices failed to detect it Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was attending a ceremony in the building the reporter who had the 3d gun was seated just 10 rows away from him and even pointed the weapon at the Prime Minister Netanyahu's office later criticized the reporter's actions as irresponsible the hamburg district of finkin Radha is home to an airbus factory the head of the company's emerging technologies department is Matias Zyliss his team uses 3d printed prototypes to help improve components the IDT we've had a long handoff in fact is potentially competitive manufacturing definitely has the potential to change the entire value chain we can do production on site redesign processes and print on demand we can develop completely new products for next-generation aircraft this is where Airbus assembles it's a 350 passenger jets a key component is now being printed in quantity the door locking shaft they're due to fly in the aircraft later this year this component usually consists of ten parts but the Airbus version has just one we've integrated several functions and reduced the weight there are two of these parts per door and they make the aircraft lighter by four kilograms that's a lot in the aviation world it cuts down on fuel consumption and co2 emissions over the 30-year lifespan of an aircraft one less kilogram of weight will save half a million liters of fuel the a350 actually has a lot of 3d printed parts sixteen door lock shafts 20 brackets for the crew cabin compartments and more than 1,000 plastic parts in panels ventilation systems and electronics gear Airbus is even testing prototypes of electrical parts 3d printing is typically used to build grid structures like this cabin partition wall the printed version uses less material and so is lighter than previous models airlines are always trying to reduce the weight of their planes to save fuel but Airbus believes the 3d process could be even more efficient though this is the largest component that we can make right now we'd like to build bigger ones it took us a total of 900 hours to produce a complete partition wall in 7 construction chambers that means we had to start up a printer seven times to produce the 116 parts we needed 40 stud 900 hours of printing time for just one wall that's a lot of work in future the hope is to print a mold and then cast it again and again right now conventional mass production methods can still produce components like this more quickly and cheaply than 3d can but that could soon change this is the form next additive manufacturing trade fair in Frankfurt there are some sophisticated examples of 3d technology here like this model of a human body printed in one go klaus emmerman advises companies on which 3d production methods might work best for them he says that more and more businesses are making the transition to this technology the automotive industry is now starting to design 3d components for their vehicles that's good for the environment because those parts will be produced only on demand and they can be made using powder which can be delivered locally and printed out anywhere in the world where they're needed for example these lightweight brake pedals were made by 3d printers and produced at a local factory that cuts down on waste and emissions respond we typically save 6 tons of co2 emissions per kilo compared to conventional methods this facility in the state of Lower Saxony will be able to print 3d component parts out of aluminium fully automatically this technology could encourage companies to keep their production facilities in Germany instead of exporting them overseas vehicon yes we can bring those factories back to Germany provided that they're fully automated and if we can do that we'll increase the economic value of German companies but traditional mass production is still unbeatably cheap particularly in Asia 3d printing will have to bring something else to the table like printing several components at once such innovations could enhance the competitive profile of German companies 3d printing is already well known for its ability to produce complex prototypes the motorcycle designed and built by big rep was finished in time for the expo but company executives say that they'll have to do a better job of giving customers what they want we all know that for 30 years think about it 30 years there's been a promise made through the Industrial custom out there what 3d printing can do for them we were talking about speed are we fast enough in printing we're talking about precision is that what's coming out of the machine really what we want is it repeatable are we getting the same part over and over again this is what the customer the industrial customer wants and I think we all agree there has been great disappointment around it then that we're going to change today for some applications many kinds of 3d printing are still too slow too imprecise and too expensive but improvements are underway the new big rep printers work up to 10 times faster than the old ones printing speed is the key to making 3d technology more profitable and carbon fiber materials can make the printouts more durable in fact a US firm called carbon based near San Francisco has teamed up with a DDoS to make soles for sport shoes adidas is a pioneer in the use of 3d technology in its products the co-founder and chairman of carbons board Joseph DeSimone invented a process that allows for the mass production of custom-made 3d components his company's partnership with adidas is a big step forward no-one's ever taken 3d printing a high-volume adidas represents a a seminal moment I would argue in the history of industry where we've got volumes that now allow us to have a cost down curve just like injection molding this process could present a cost-effective alternative to conventional mass production methods two years ago it took more than two hours to print a shoe sole like this one now it takes just 30 minutes this will allow the 3d printing world to go from a 10 billion dollar prototyping world to a three hundred billion dollar manufacturing juggernaut so far that's just a vision the grid structure of the 3d shoe sole cannot yet be fully customized and production will not be relocated to Germany where adidas is based the printed soles are shipped to factories in Asia where the shoes are assembled so right now this is not a particularly sustainable production model but that could change in future digital sustainability that's a combination of things one is dematerialization the other one is mitigating supply chains right and having parts on demand or local for local production but it goes well beyond that we've had some breakthroughs now where we can get into bio-based feedstocks Carbon still mainly prints with polymer resins that are petroleum sourced the light sensitive materials enable the company to make products with complex grid structures that are more lightweight but it's also working on ways to make the products more sustainable Vitas is going to do it all polyurethane shoe they've set targets out in the next 10 years or less to have shoes that are recyclable and we have the ability of doing that here at the Frankfurt trade fair such visions of sustainable 3d printing sound like a welcome development but how likely are they to be realized economists all of H petrol is skeptical about promises from the industry these are mainly visions or hopes for the future at this point there's not much evidence that more sustainability is really being achieved petrol works at the Institute for ecological economic research in Berlin the Institute has done a study on whether a mobile phone case printed at home in Germany is more environmentally friendly than one that's mass-produced in Asia and found out that they're about the same that's because the lower co2 emissions from local 3d printing are offset by the higher energy consumption of the printing machines this process is neither particularly sustainable nor economical but it can be profitable for some companies under certain conditions companies can generally make money on expensive 3d printing projects only if they can speed up or streamline production still they'll use fewer materials and some products could be recycled even if they're custom-made we've come to the reflow recycling company in Amsterdam to find out whether 3d printing production really is sustainable about 80% of printed products are made of plastic and only a fraction of them are recyclable or biodegradable this machine at reflow turns discarded plastic bottles into plastic filaments that can be used for printing the granules come from PE tea bottles the material is suitable for 3d printing and it's cheek filaments from reflow were used to build the walls of a shop in London that sells fashions made from recyclable materials sustainability is often good for business but not everyone is willing to pay more for these products so reflow sells its recycled filaments at the same price as its competitors who products a less sustainable industry is interested in sustainability because basically their consumers are asking for it right it's a big macroeconomic trend and industrial players will just have to follow for example reflow supplies 3d material to a company that makes sunglasses this would replace an entire block of raw plastic from which the frames are normally milled and that cuts down on plastic waste reflows recycling technology is already being used in several other countries in India plastic bottles picked up from garbage dumps can be converted into plastic filaments for 3d printing and those who collect the bottles can earn some extra income this technology can help to enhance local value-added cycles all over the world converting discarded plastic into useful products the 3d printing industry is expanding rapidly and growing ever faster and more efficient but it will be some time before we see the promised improvements like shorter supply chains reductions in overproduction the elimination of warehouses for spare parts and the use of recyclable materials in closed-loop systems all that will require a lot of new investment you", "oNvknYOuvuw": "[Music]

ahead and kill you okay let's go fix the lights oh it's so dark no all right let's go fix the lights yeah hey jack how's it going we're fixing lights there it is who fixed them carol fixed them this is bizarre here let me help you carl that'll help there you go oh you jerk i was fixing my settings ew i look like a toilet all right i'm just going looking for bodies let me find a task i want to do one all right there's a couple there's a whole gang in here what is happening here hey wildcat laser beam why are there four people down huh all righty let's just call the lights oh no the lights oh dead body and electrical wait a minute wait all right well it's not me i agree also it is not me i would like the third that it's not me who found the body let's start with that i found the body it was on the lights panel in my experience wildcat doing this with mr beast he's always imposter not as super sauce oh my god i swear to god i you have no proof it's very sauce you think you can invite us here to play this and then kill us all it's not even close honestly i'm voting you out just for making me wake up early get him out here i just would like to say you guys are all stupid i hated that guy anyway well that's not very good uh i thought it was mr beast okay maybe it's chandler chandler hasn't said a damn thing this whole time they just voted me out for no reason i did nothing well i'm almost done with my tasks i haven't done a single task it might be laser i'm just gonna say it's chandler oh no bro okay you're kidding me anyone dead anywhere i feel dumb don't kill me don't kill me hey mr septic guy how you doing well i'm dead over here guys come on oh god lights are out oh i thought i was about to get murdered let's see who it is i came up to jack he was just kind of standing around walking around i don't know what he was doing so i feel like jack killed but i don't know oh interesting mr wildcat because i said i was 100 clear i also said that i believe jack i believe jack thank you i'm skipping but i think it's jack honestly because i kind of want to get murdered in three days i want to see what that's like that would be pretty cool yeah stick around jack and it'll happen for sure all right laser babe you want to get mutted do ya murder me i want to see what it feels like i think it's wild cat it's either wildcat or dany i don't believe that it's laser beam it's jack it's jacked everybody's super grouped listen i'm gonna try and win this yes come kill me please i'm all done where's laser why is it so hard to get killed nowadays yes i died oh that's unfortunate wait i saw you doing when the door opened to be fair all i was doing was filling lasers requests so actually i'm the good guy in this scenario get him out of here laser how was getting murdered in 3d was that pretty cool oh that was sick dude all right let's run it back i'm so nervous i don't know what to do so now this round i'm going to follow somebody yeah we're not imposter that's fine well i'm never going to get him pasta why am i never imposter i'm going on my own chandler's been imposter a lot today so i'll probably follow him around is he gonna kill oh no he's got me i'm an idiot dream one less person that can do tasks ladies and gentlemen i've witnessed a murder first hand who was it i just get off the task turning my right and i see a blood splatter in a white half body sitting there and then i look around and i see chandler running away fleeing did you write that down just so you could read it when you're imposter if it's not chandler we vote wild yep fine please vote him out next there's no voting me out next because it's gonna say it was an imposter i'm sorry yay dang it i still say vote mr beast out because it's funny lights are out i'm already on the way to the lights you know what i don't care about the lights this is next level strats you just don't care about the lights and you just go and do your tasks i'm telling you guys he's following me stop a dream dream he was the imposter i feel like whoever's impostor just killed someone oh i just saw danny alive like two seconds ago hey look at that yeah no this is actually a great button because i have some info it can't be george it can't be me and it can't be you if you're at the button he died like outside med bay and it can't be me because i was figuring out how to start the engine so that leaves one person it's either jack dreams sapnap or laser a justice for mr bass yeah get jack out of here okay if you want your youtube title this is just for your behavior in previous rounds yeah honestly just get them out of here no oh i am shocked it's completely fine listen to how mr b says it's fine jimmy yellow scammer the dream there goes the lights no one's gonna die fire lights going out on me where are the lights we got gonna do my temperature task i know it's dream finish my tasks i think now i've earned the right to go look at some cameras i'm going to be big brain and call the button dream is suss dream is hella sauce for sure how am i suss i was trying to do your sauce on the last kill you're suss on the last kill zap knap what is the meaning behind this button i was trying to be big brain that's snap sap nappy up for wasting a button yeah you failed honestly we should execute him for it no no no no so i'll do this i already voted for dream but i'm down it's dream it's dream no he's imposter oh wait oh crap no hug me laser hug me too well at least i finished all my tasks so i can watch everybody we did say no stacking but we're gonna stack apparently let's move together group group group yeah i'm just gonna go i'll let him motor finally starting to learn where everything is running the lights sprinting the lights you're joking mr beast and dream together no i don't like this one there's no way he gets away with it there's no way he gets away with it what is going on right here what is going on right here oh get away from me done done tasks yes i'm a good crewmate i'm dead you're just going to kill one more person right not dream die oh can't see anything was that a person i saw hello it is me septic man see if we can find a body back here no no thank you oh he got him he's dropped to the corner again audience specimen maybe oh no dreams protecting mr beast he won't let anyone hurt him hey i hope he goes called the meeting i don't want to call him anything oh oh that's unfortunate did anybody die oh yeah no definitely somebody died so we did not have four people george died who is the last to say george i do have a little bit of information early on in the round i saw dream and mr beast making out hard their lips locked i was with mr bass i'd say at least 70 of this round probably i don't think it was dream we were together majority of the time i think it's laser i called it i called the vote out chandler so you know it's not me wait wait no then it's dream or mr basin like what is this well we were the guy the whole time mr beast didn't kill there's no way this was killed george because i was with him the whole time so then it's wildcat to me it's either dream or laser beam because i don't think it's beast literally can't be me bro i've been doing my target i mean literally can't be you it definitely can uh wildcat or laser pick your pick your take your pick i i'm going to go with laser

most popular nintendo console to date but it did feature an extremely good mario game super mario 3d world only problem was not a ton of people actually got the chance to play it in comparison to the current fan base that owns a nintendo switch fortunately the game has been given a remaster slash port treatment and brought over to the switch just a few days ago now i was surprised by the difficulty and delighted by the charm the first time i completed this game i'm happy to say super mario 3d world holds up extremely well on a different console some smart features that make sense for a switch port but this new version also adds something totally unique a spin-off game called bowser's fury that for me signifies the potential future of 3d mario titles hey everyone and welcome back to an all new episode of the completionist new game plus the show where i am re-completing the first 120 games i ever featured here on the channel more on that in the box down below speaking of boxes and your support and awful bad transitions a big shout out to patreon.com completionist mostly because for those who subscribe for a quarter or more in the higher tiers you got access to a free poster that looks like this now this poster right here in my hand is not what you got if you're on the patreon because it came in a different color if you want to pick up this right here you're not on the patreon you can head over to completionist.com today and pick one up this is a poster that celebrates the last uh few months of the completionist in terms of games we've completed jokes we've made so on and so forth so again if you want to pick one of these guys back up or pick one of these up you can head over to completionist.com and get one today now on to the game at hand super mario 3d world here's the deal i love this game it's one of my favorite games i ever played on the nintendo wii u it's a game that i really thought no one got to enjoy and i'm so happy that it's out now on the nintendo switch for all you guys to enjoy more importantly this game was one of the early markings of my relationship with nintendo and it just seemed so appropriate because they hashtag free product hashtag not an ad i was not set paid to say this but i'm clarifying as best i can uh they gave me the game early and that means a lot because i haven't gotten the game early since super mario odyssey with that said i'm very excited for super mario 3d world not because it's one of my favorite mario games of all time but there's new features like multiplayer online there's amiibo support faster gameplay and there's another game inside of here in the form of bowser's fury so with that said let's recomplete super mario 3d world plus bowser's fury we're gonna recomplete mario 3d world and then complete bowser's fury because it was not before let's let's let's begin i've talked enough [Music] for as long as there have been nintendo systems there have been mario games now not every nintendo home console launched with the mario game and not every mario game was a launch title but it is undeniable that the success of any given mario game is dependent on the success of the console it launched on it might seem like an obvious thing to say but even if a game is fantastic popularity is easily swayed by its platform super mario 3d world is one such casualty now i'm convinced that a super mario 3d world world launch title for the nintendo wii u and the wii u wasn't called the wii u the story of that system and how the game is viewed would be a very different one the first three nintendo home consoles launched with mario games and those games are heralded as some of the most legendary in history super mario 3d world should have been the flagship wii u mario title instead this game got buried behind new super mario bros u which came out the year before 3d world when i first completed it i thought super mario 3d world blew new super mario bros u out of the water and i love new super mario bros u and thanks to a recent financial report we now know that the switch has almost sold four times as many units as the wii u ever did that means that this recent switch port gives more people than ever the chance to play this unsung hero of a mario game i loved talking about this game when it came out every now and then i get to complete a game that i want to do that's brand new and this one fit the bill perfectly at the time it was billed as the next step in 3d mario i found it to be a passionate love letter to mario as the series and this is in 2013 years before mario odyssey blew all of us away again 3d world is much more than just a console version of the 3ds's super mario 3d land this game reminded me why i love 3d mario games yet again i thought it was aesthetically gorgeous one of my favorite looking and sounding mario games to date everything about it is charming and smile inducing and though i found the completion process a little maddening i still gave the game my now retired rating of benept the story in 3d world does things a little differently making it slightly more compelling than the average mario title mario and pals aren't teaming up to rescue peach for bowser this time around in fact 3d world calls back to super mario brothers 2 by letting players control peach and toad as playable characters don't get me wrong bowser is still kidnapping but this time it's spritxies adorable little fairy folk mario luigi peach and toad chase bowser to the spricksy kingdom to save the seven sprixies and defeat bowser once again until they eventually play a sport or a car racing game so the real draw of any mario game is the gameplay super mario 3d world is a return to form for 3d platformers from the character who basically originated the genre but also combines this 2d element via level design in objectives players choose a character and jump dash flow and flutter through dozens of differently themed stages and worlds on their way to the flagpole that ends each stage there are collectibles to find mainly three green stars and stamps but 3d world also breaks up the action from just 3d platforming with mystery houses and captain tone levels there's plenty to do it's still a mario game but with plenty of fresh elements sprinkled throughout i found the original game pretty easy to blast through at first but the difficulty steadily ramps up in the last couple of worlds felt like a final exam for everything i had learned from mario games up until that point i found that 3d world pushed me more and more the longer it went on with the final worlds requiring me to use hundreds of stockpiled lives to figure out a way through it's been almost eight years since the original release of super mario 3d world looking back the game felt truly innovative now that it's on switch this game can finally get the attention i feel it deserves [Music] i've always thought that super mario 3d world was low-key one of the best games no one ever played completing it again i realized a bunch of things the game is both better than i remember due to some mechanical improvements made for the switch version and it also reminded me of why i want to make content online recompleting super mario 3d world made me excited to create and although this game is largely the same as the original wii u version i've changed a lot since then resulting in a far easier completion process than i anticipated but let me back up real quick because there is a lot about 3d world that gets me excited on the video game side as i recompleted this game several things sprang to mind i think the visuals here are some of the best in the mario series definitely in the upper echelon the music is phenomenal still a highlight after all of these years and the tattoo alone makes the case for being one of my favorite power-ups in the mario game for the utility it adds to the gameplay now i know i just said this but i cannot praise the music enough long-time series composer koji kondo actually took a back seat during the music production during 3d world with super mario galaxy composer mojito yokota taking the lead the first time i played this game i was struck at how little classic mario music was reused most of it was new for 3d world the jazzy big band inspired soundtrack remains one of my favorite things to return to in fact i can draw a straight line from my band big bad bosses to this game's soundtrack the theme for world bowser one of the toughest areas in 3d world towards the end of the game is full of swagger and boldness that i've always associated with bowser that track alone was the true inspiration for what drove me forward to creating big bad bosses with jake kaufman which spawned the boy band album that you all know today that you hopefully have via spotify or itunes google play by please this game has hands down some of the funkiest tunes in mario history the quality of life updates for the switch version are subtle yet game changing most significant is that the movement speed in general is increased by a little bit not by a lot but enough especially if you put a ton of time into the wii u version it is a little noticeable and makes the game feel a little more modern combined with the fact that my skills have been honed since the original release of this game and i found that completion was much easier this time around i was still doing the same stuff finding three green stars and a stamp on every main stage completing mystery house challenges and captain toad puzzles and completing every stage by reaching the top of every flagpole with every character in the game but it was a pleasure to do so speaking of captain toad 3d world was actually the introduction of captain toad as a playable character the captain toad treasure tracker was ported to switch before 3d world was so there's probably a ton of people who've played that game before they experienced these levels i love their implementation into this game and the switch version is definitely definitive way to play these levels the wii u gamepad was difficult at times but with the switch you can just use your controller the camera is a lot easier to control in this version and with the increased movement speed it's just generally better all around the captain toad portions of this game aren't nearly as intricate as the full version but i love the captain toad is involved here and these short diorama-like stages are a great way to break up the platforming levels one of my favorite features of the original version was that i could choose who i wanted to play as resulting in pretty different experiences across all worlds and stages this time through completion was made easier because i knew exactly how to make the most of each character's strengths and weaknesses by using peach and her floating ability or luigi and his high jump i was able to hit the top of the flagpole without even trying sometimes what i'm trying to say is that i hate playing as toad because man that dude can barely jump compared to the rest of the playable characters in this game and even though he's not my favorite character i still didn't have much trouble beating every level with every character this is partly due to the drop-in dropout co-op mechanic that was used in the original wii u version that still is here on twitch i could essentially summon a second player with another joy con or controller and then pick up that character and carry them to the flagpole touching the top of a flagpole and holding another character counts as completion for both of the characters which cuts completion time for the game down quite a lot there may be a ton to do completion wise but i felt so much more prepared this time around mainly i knew better how to take full advantage of the tanooki suit in the cat belt in my original playthrough i would often have to replace stages multiple times to find every collectible this time around i was able to snag almost every green star and stamp my first or second time through the stage because my mario literacy is through the roof now i could basically read what every stage wanted me to do to find secrets and if i couldn't figure it out the right way i usually had a cat bell or tanooki suit stored away as insurance completing this game gave me a sense of satisfaction because i felt like i had grown so the photo mode that replaces the miiverse functionality is really good in fact both 3d world and bowser's fury are designed around photo mode 3d world has some of the most vibrant art direction of any mario game and it was a clear inspiration for odyssey with the photo mode and the way the collectible stamps are used it feels like a chance to celebrate how this game looks even more there's one more new feature that i thought was going to be bad but turned out to be incredible i can't believe i'm about to say this online functionality now the wii u version did not have any online multiplayer the switch does and when i played this game with kit and krista from nintendo minute and andre from blackbeard comedy it truly felt like we're in the same room together let me repeat that it felt like i was playing a cooperative game on nintendo switch online in the same room together during a pandemic it was chaotic fun and a welcome change for a nintendo game to have a smooth online experience now full disclosure i had the chance to play online in a bubble before the servers were fully publicly available since i experienced the game early if nintendo can keep the online support for this game as strong as it was when i played it then the future is going to be very bright for future nintendo titles but they have a lot of work to do until then in fact once the game was made public i realized something that saved me a bunch of time so first things first in the original episode i actually made a huge mistake and i think i repeated my mistake here in this episode too so i'm here to clear the air right now i claim that you have to touch the top of every flagpole with every character in order to complete the game you don't you need to touch the top of every flagpole with one character it doesn't need to be all in one character just the fact that you have to touch the very top of every flagpole in the game but from there if the host player decides to invite three friends to play with them you and some friends can do a whole clear of the game with all 5 characters with me and my twitch mods we cleared the entire game's speed run style in about three and a half hours that was after the fact that i got all the green stars and i got all the stamps so we were clearly just rushing to get to the end of every single stage this saved me so much time compared to last time when i had to have a friend over or i had to turn on my wiimotes and touch the flag at the exact same time so shout outs to my mods for helping me complete this game and of course there's the invincibility leaf situation now for those of you guys who don't know if you lose enough lives on a level in mario games nowadays eventually this golden item box will spawn and if players pick up the leaf it essentially locks you out of true completion it's a great feature for less experienced or easily frustrated mario players or people who just want to blast through any given level the game doesn't tell you that using this item closes the true completion door in your face this is a nintendo trend at this point seems like there's always something the game never tells you about that if you do hurts completionists they did this in super mario 3d land for the 3ds which was way worse over there and last summer's paper mario the origami king stuff i wouldn't mind so much if they had just mentioned it beforehand but at least i'd already completed 3d world so i knew about the turtles way in advance to get a little nostalgic here completing 3d world again reminded me of when i was starting out on my youtube career this was one of my favorite nintendo opportunities to cover the game early in the personal style that i have and it led to a wonderful relationship but beyond the professional stuff i was just utterly charmed by everything in this game completing it again i was reminded of that charm and the excitement that comes from playing something crafted with true passion [Music] all right enough about the old stuff it's time to talk about the big new thing included in the switch version of super mario 3d world a whole other game called bowser's fury now it might seem short to some but it is dense bowser's fury channels charm and smart design choices to present what could be the future of 3d mario games or rather what the current state is via mario odyssey and how design philosophies could continue in a new direction when bowser's fury was first teased fans went crazy trying to figure out just what it was exactly was it an added world to the original game a new game plus of sorts it's something in between bowser's fury is an open world mario full of new things to collect and areas to explore it feels like one very very large mario odyssey style level big enough to hide a ton of secrets but still compact in that it doesn't take a long time to go from one corner to the next this game is also playable from the very second you boot up the game to me bowser's jury feels like the mario odyssey dlc that we never got gameplay is as if mario odyssey and 3d world had a baby with freedom of exploration and many missions that characterize odyssey but with the mechanics and power-ups of 3d world it's a joyous combination of the two there's even a whole new story to kick things off for once bowser jr needs mario's help bowser the villain that we've all come to know and level for several different games has been corrupted for the first time ever bowser is truly terrifying and bowser jr just wants his dad back mario and bowser jr must find cat shine spread throughout lake lapcat and use the power of the golden gigabell to shine a light and restore big bow back to how he once was the first time i played super mario 3d world i said it was a love letter to what came before bowser's fury rekindles a similar feeling to me the world feels about three or four times the size of a mario odyssey level and it's all seamlessly connected there are discreet little islands and zones full of micromissions to complete all over the lake and i dearly hope that future 3d mario games draw from what this game establishes bowser's fury takes the cute charm of 3d world and cranks it up to 11. like the cats who power up in 3d world well how about an entire cat themed paradise there are seagulls with cat ears i've been running through bowser's fury and literally have to stop because i was laughing at a seagull with cat ears this feels like an ever escalating bit in the best way like someone in rnd nintendo was like what if we put cat ears on boom boom and then someone else slammed the table and said what if we put cat ears on everything i hope nintendo keeps trying to top themselves in future games because the way they do it here is wonderful i thought i knew what to expect as i started bowser's fury but the game surprised me constantly the looming doom of bowser and his presence really affected me my first thought upon seeing calamity bowser or fury bowser whatever he's called was that there will never be anything as evil looking as this in a mario game ever again it's a great twist for the character we may not see this exact bowser ever again but i think we'll see nintendo drawing on their history to make unexpected changes going forward the game also has some gameplay tweaks that i did not see coming mainly the way that bowser jr is implemented in the game it's surprisingly great a second controller can't control him but he can also be controlled by ai and this completely changes the game i could choose whether bowser jr would help me a little or a lot when he's helping me a lot he's basically in hunter killer mode bashing enemies with a paint brush and helping uncover power-ups that i could store for later use this was especially helpful during the completion journey as he would pretty much protect me from harm as i went after the cat shines but he's still bratty bowser jr and his sass and aggressive personality shines through if an enemy hits mario bowser jr chuckles to himself i hope nintendo keeps flushing outside characters like this there's also a butt load of new elements shadow luigi anyone seeing mario's brother pop up in shadow form was a shock and felt yet like another innovative look ahead it's also one more little nod to super mario sunshine whenever shadow luigi would pop up i had to chase him down to grab a cat shine from him he felt designed to specifically distract me from whatever i was doing but it always led to something new and interesting probably the most significant change in bowser's fury makes it so that it gives mario an inventory of sorts now up to this point mario's been able to store up to one power-up for some time but bowser's fury lets me hold on to five of each power-up and i can swap between them whenever i want it this might seem like a small change but it makes exploration totally different whenever i needed it i could pull out a cat bell turn into a cat and climb a wall if i stumbled into an area full of cat-eared magikoopas i could pull out the boomerang and be good to go being able to reach into mario's bag of tricks and get what i needed feels revolutionary in a way that i didn't expect there's never been anything quite like this before in a mario game in the same way that the open world of mario odyssey felt like a turning point giving mario an extended inventory is a thing that i hope continues for future mario titles and at first it seemed like having a full bag of power-ups would make the game seem too easy that quickly changed the first time the rain started pouring down and godzilla bowser reared his gigantic head i rarely associate panic with mario but every time bowser appeared things got crazy it turns out i needed all those power-ups after all just to survive when i wasn't dodging out of bowser's way i was doing my best to lure him over to another new element bowser blocks these blocks are unbreakable by mario but it was absolutely necessary to destroy them to gather cat shines or power-ups inside them fortunately bowser's fire blasts can break them it was extremely enjoyable to find the balance of scampering out of the way of bowser's wrath and using his attacks to unlock what i needed putting bowser on a timer like the blood moon from breath of the wild is a stroke of genius if i was in the middle of a difficult jumping section and it started to drizzle i knew i had to hurry the hell up or i would be in big trouble rarely has a mario game made me feel this way there is always something new to do at any point on the map and sometimes running away from one spot would lead me to something in a different area bowser's fury was constantly pushing me beyond my limits to see something different the journey to complete bowser's fury is a surprisingly short one much like power moons and mario odyssey i was finding cat shines all over the dang place pushing me closer and closer to my final confrontation with the goop corrupted bowser every time i found a shine when bowser was trying to kill me a beam of light weakened him just a little bit and he would leave me alone for a little while eventually i found enough cat shines to power up the gigabell which gives mario a chance to crib supersonic style as the golden giga cat mario [Music] these titanic battles felt really unique and were a fresh take on the standard mario boss fight even though it takes three hits to kill as always almost unlike super mario 3d world the difficulty of bowser's fury is a little more consistent different parts of the map and the discrete challenges associated with them are unlocked by finding more cat shines and defeating giant bowser in battle mario and bowser jr can basically go explore anywhere they want with the help of the aquatic dino plessy the best thing about plessy is that it's essentially a fast travel mechanic in a gigantic sea of water if you ever get lost plessy is there to save you after about 50 or so cat shines the game essentially forces you into the final boss fight once that was over i was free to continue exploring and gathering cat shines until all was said and done because honestly that's all there is to do to complete bowser's fury collect all 100 cat shines seems like a little compared to other mario titles but still feels just as satisfying when super mario 3d world came out it broke the mold now new players have the chance to see how charming and just how freaking tight the game is bowser's fury breaks the mold too it's the mario odyssey dlc that never existed but could herald much more involved mario mechanics in the future or hey maybe it's just another weird spin-off and i'm totally wrong either way it's a worthy experiment that totally deserves to be celebrated and played all the way through even if completion bonuses leave a little bit more to be desired bowser's fury is a total success as 3d platformers both super mario 3d world and bowser's fury have a ton of collectibles to find for both games the rewards for doing every little thing seem minimal but the fact that the journey to completion is acknowledged at all is still a very nice feeling battling cow bowser or meowzer to some and seeing the credits unlocks a few things first up you unlock luigi bros which is the original mario brothers game starring luigi why luigi because this game has a ton of references to luigi in order to celebrate the year at the time the year of luigi but unlike most of you out there watching this the joke's on you i celebrate the year of luigi every year second you end up unlocking three more worlds world star world mushroom and world flower these three worlds are either remixes of older levels that make them more difficult albeit more enemies or tougher time clear conditions or genuinely new levels that are more difficult than most stages in the game most of these stages once again include three more stars and more stamps once you've done the preliminary completion of finding every star stamp and touching the top of every flagpole with at least one character you unlock the ability to see what levels you've cleared with what characters you've done it with meaning you can now track all the levels in the game that you still have to clear multiple times but the big final discovery is that you unlock world crown which features one more captain toad level a monster of a gauntlet in a form of the mystery house and the granddaddy of them all champions road champions rhone hands down is not only the most difficult level in the game but one of the most brutal levels in mario history it will truly test every bit of your skill it's long it's difficult and it's challenging but i think it's the perfect way to end this mario journey and if you've completed everything up to this point all correctly you'll have five stars that appear on your game save file meaning you've completed the game and if you remembered to never ever ever ever use that invincibility tanooki suit then those five stars sparkle and shine it's basically just an acknowledgement for the player that yeah you've done everything and now you're sparkly let's jump back to bowser's fury the rewards for finding all the shines in bowser's fury are a little more visible and fun with all cat shines found during the final boss fight bowser's hair turns an electric neon white which is very cool best of all though there are cosmetic changes that you've earned bowser jr now becomes cat bowser jr and now whenever you have the cat suit cat mario now becomes mini giga cat mario now again these don't fundamentally change much of anything in the game it's just a really cool thing you can see if you're running around the world again and again in 2013 i was disappointed that the completion rewards weren't very tangible in 3d world but now that i've completed more mario games and haven't completed this one again i can say that the journey is the reward being able to point to my game save and say yeah i did that feels awesome it's the same with bowser's fury everything about the game is just so right the difficulty is on par with mario odyssey at the very least but instead of collecting hundreds and hundreds of moons the game wraps it up after just 100 and you do get to see the full painting that bowser jr was working on from the very opening cut scene and the casting aesthetic across the entire game is just icing on the cake when i re-completed super mario 3d world and completed bowser's fury there were 380 green stars collected spread out over levels mystery houses and captain toad levels 85 stamps found and even though me vs no more i appreciated messing around with the stamps in photo mode 100 cat shines found perhaps the most adorable collectible in any mario game 25 and a half hours played a way faster run through super mario 3d world than my original playthrough the combination of faster movement speed in general general mastery on my part and the fact that i did a four player multiplayer clear with my twitch mods that saved me a ton of time 1355 deaths now before i hear all of you making fun of me i want to be clear about something on my single player playthrough i died about 50 times however when you play online the host lobby is responsible for all the lives lost and when you're trying to clear every level in the game with friends it's a chaotic masterpiece thus adding all those extra lives to my playthrough and two games in one package the best way to return to a classic game is to turn it into two games as most of you guys know by now i love super mario 3d world i love it more now than the first time i completed it which hasn't always been the case during my new game plus adventures maybe it's the benefit of hindsight but i found the ball choices bolder the charm more charming the journey more fulfilling and bowser's fury floored me with the light i couldn't put it down literally completing it in just a matter of hours i did not expect to love as much as i did and i really didn't expect it to make me this hype for the future of 3d mario titles nintendo really honored the legacy of this game and has done mario fans everywhere an amazing favor by giving more people now than ever the chance to play and enjoy these games now here's the deal though completionists might not like what they're about to experience in playing this game if you're completing it amongst friends you're going to have a wonderful time if you don't have any friends or your friends are selfish you don't want to help you with your save file then you're going to have to do what i originally did in this video which was play the game by yourself and just hope that you have enough patience to keep up with you getting all the five stars and the shiny sheen on your game save file does feel good and i really do enjoy that and that for me is a personal fulfilling thing but in a big but i could see why completionists everywhere are so divided amongst this entire thing thus that's why i used to have the original rating of finnepedia but since then i decided to choose my convictions and battles more carefully and more specifically so with that in mind guys i give super mario 3d world plus bowser's fury my completionist rating of completed [Music] you", "TF6DaAea5HQ": "how nice is this all new mercedes key for the all-new s-class [Music] what's up guys it's supercar blondie welcome to the channel right before we start the car review i want to give

your chance to win go for it guys go for it all right check this out guys mercedes-benz pops out and look at this key how nice is this all new mercedes key for the all-new s-class [Music] [Applause] [Music] look at this interior all right you ready for this come on in look at all these lights red violet i've never seen such a beautiful interior honestly welcome to the supercar body channel we open this back up so you can come in and turn that back on auto now this cool material here i really like this i've never seen this before this is woven steel so you've got this all the way across the front here and it shines so brilliantly it looks gorgeous now this is your 12.3 inch display here in the center and it's password protected look at that so this is your new interface guys and if you press on this you can actually change all of your ambient lights look at this one look at that how beautiful is this oh my goodness you can go to warmth mode for example it basically changes everything for you let's switch on the ignition everything turns yellow orange the display and your seats start to heat up so you can choose all of these different modes that are pre-programmed and i love that oh that's so nice what is even cooler you guys is what i see right here now this to me is a 3d map what i see right now on this screen is what you would see when you put on 3d glasses and go to a 3d movie i can't even tell you how blown away i am by this it is insane it's a 3d map this is ridiculous this is the all-new steering wheel as well and look how many buttons it has everywhere you've even got two whole different parts coming out here with full of buttons if you press this button right here it'll go into your different displays i love the sports one look at this and if i rev this goes in and out and guys this is all 3d for me all 3d i can't even tell you how freaking cool this is this looks like a tunnel to me i'm driving down a red sports tunnel that is crazy alice is also cool when i turn the temperature up it flashes red and then you go down a degree and it flashes blue and it goes all the way across i love that and this car has humor hey mercedes how may i help you tell me a joke sorry my engineers were german [Music] [Laughter] basically you have no sense of humor that is so good you've got a star projected on the floor i always really like the projections now this car is an s 500 a bit lacking in horsepower for my liking it's zero to 105 seconds or just under five seconds let's look at the back here look the mercedes-benz lights up here as you get in i really like that for the vip passenger press that and check out what happens this whole chair in the front moves forward now the only issue i have with this is now it pauses for a little while it takes too long for my liking what it's now going to do is tuck this headrest down so i can move forward even more but as you can see it takes its time and then finally your fortress comes out after about i don't know what was that maybe a 30 second wait i love that that can fold forward because of course it means that you can get way more space here in the back and it is very spacious which is very nice in the back here you have this little screen that you can pop out with this button and it delivers it to you which is quite nice and this is where you can control a lot of your functions or just surf the web whatever you'd like to do you've got these beautiful big screens massive screens what is cool is it has rear wheel steering i'm going to show you that in a sec which means for a long car it's got a great turning circle okay you see here it says digital light that's exactly what it is so what it has is 1.3 million mini mirrors in the lights that actually light up the road in front of you with hazard signs or it lights up certain things that it thinks you need to see along the road if the car detects that another car is about to slam into you the whole car in a split second will raise by eight centimeters it would literally just go and that is to get you out of the way of the crash zone oh it's so pretty we love a bit of a light display now watch the back reel here guys as it turns turns opposite to the front wheels so the starting price for the new s-class is about 120 000 this one with all of the added options is about 180 000 i actually like the driver's seat more than i do the back in this car which probably isn't right because it's meant to be a kind of a chauffeur driven car but i just think all of these features here are too cool to pass up you wouldn't want to be chauffeured when you have a 3d screen if i look at this mirror here it's going to recognize that and it's just going to turn this mirror and then if i look at this mirror it will recognize that and it will turn this mirror so that is really cool it's got this special extra warning to tell you where to turn so let's see what happens as i approach this u-turn yeah look the arrows the arrows are like now now now before you miss your exit that's quite cool [Music] you", "ln8shOFugcA": "[Music] [Applause] so so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign you", "n-MPnCGWWlo": "welcome to NCIX tech tips today's episode is going to be about 3d stereoscopic gaming particularly focused on AMD HD 3d now I know we haven't really covered this topic in the past we've talked mostly about invidious 3d vision however AMD does have their own stereoscopic 3d gaming ecosystem and we're going to tell you guys how to set it up as well as compare it to the solution from the green team now for the hardware setup side of things you do need a some slightly different requirements versus 3d vision for example AMD doesn't produce their own glasses so you're gonna have to get a display that comes with glasses most displays that come with glasses whether they're TVs and HD 3d does work on TVs whether they're TVs or whether their monitors are going to have the necessary 3d technology built into them to run AMD HD 3d basically as long as the display is capable of running 3d blu-ray or other 3d content than it is 3d capable enough to use HD 3d now you also need a powerful enough Radeon graphics card in order to produce both the right and left eye images in order to game in stereo 3d so I would definitely recommend I mean at the time of filming this something from their 7000 series of cards if you want the best possible experience now for our test setup today we've also got an intel x79 motherboard with 16 gigs of kingston ram a thirty nine thirty at 30 K six core processor an SSD boot drive and a 1200 watt power supply all of this running on a gigabyte X 79 a ud7 motherboard and water cooled by Corsair now once you've configured all of your hardware a couple things make sure you're using a high data-rate connection in the latest AMD Catalyst driver so by high data-rate connection I mean no HDMI no single-link DVI you want dual link DVI or DisplayPort unless you're running at 720p in which case HDMI is just fine so the next thing you need to do is download the middleware so we're using tried F 3d and tried F 3d as a fourteen-day three free trial free trusty I've got now free trial and the free trial allows you to well try it out before you actually buy once you've installed it the setup process is quite simple all you do is launch tried f3d ignition or you can even launch the whole tried f.3d launcher so you can do movies or pictures or games then you do a scan on your computer and it'll automatically pick up all the games that it sees itself as being compatible with you can manually add games as well by just finding the executable so in this case we're going to be running crisis for our demo today and the last thing you need to do not the last thing sorry not quite blessed thing the next thing you need to do is make sure your monitor or your TV is running at 120 Hertz now if you have a TV that's like 120 Hertz clear motion that doesn't necessarily mean it is a full 120 Hertz you need to make sure it is a 3d compatible display or you're probably not going to have any success so in this case this is a 120 Hertz panel we make sure it's set to that then the last thing is to go into the tools and display settings of 3d ignition and make sure that it is set up correctly so we tried a number of different a number of different profiles before we found one that worked a hundred percent in 3d in this case we went with left/right remember there are different formats about putting 3d to a display and it depends on how your display interprets it however the software does come pre-loaded with a number of profiles including a generic HD 3d one under AMD so once you've got all of that set up all there is to it is to launch your game so the launcher can actually even launch team game so Crysis is a steam game and it kicks out this error but it actually works and we'll show it to you guys in just a moment so I want to wrap this up with some actual live gameplay using HD 3d so we launched Crysis one using the middleware and we are running it on our samsung series 9s a 950 display with the Samsung glasses so let's let's sum this up in terms of performance so we can run Crysis on high at 1080p in 3d which actually is no mean feat even now however the challenge that we did run into is that we're using Crysis 1 we actually had trouble with some of the newer games and that stands to reason because instead of like the green side where nvidia is the one building the glasses building the software building the graphics card and certifying the display on the AMD side pretty much any 3d display and any third-party 3d glasses and then any AMD graphics card that supports 3d and finally there's a third party working on the middleware so you've got third party software as well as two pieces of third party hardware involved the compatibility wasn't as comprehensive as you find with 3d vision so the flip side of that is that the flexibility in terms of the hardware you can use in the future is potentially much higher because you're not even tied down just to 3d LCDs you can also use the 3d TV or a 3d projector whatever else the case may be if you can get 3d glasses for it and you can hook up an AMD graphics card to it you can use it in 3d there are some caveats though we actually did an HD 3d video a while back that ended up we were we were sort of wrong we thought the only way to run HD 3d at the time was to use HDMI and the performance was not very good now that we're running it over dual link DVI the performance is dramatically better than it was last time so ultimately here it is does it work yes is it perfect no but then I don't think anyone would argue that any stereoscopic 3d implementation is perfect it is immersive as long as you have a glasses and a good quality display then you're going to have a satisfying 3d experience and the gains that you can get running and I think that pretty much covers it so in summary beyond the nvidia side you've got this locked down hardware ecosystem that has its advantages of being compatible but has the disadvantage of being locked down and very vendor specific and on the AMD side you've got this flexible approach that maybe hasn't got quite the deep level of maturity yet that it'll need in order to be a truly seamless gaming experience but it does have that potential in the future so you might as well you know have the card that's capable of it anyway thank you

new gadget review now by the time you're watching this this season would have been over it would have ended so yeah i like to pre-record my videos so you guys always have something to watch now something i've not done is reviewed all the gadgets so if we go to cleanse and we go to the store and we go to gadgets i've done a couple of these we've checked out the astral wand we've checked out the super magnet i've used the denied on my free-to-play account i've never really done a video on it if you guys would like to see a dedicated video on it let me know in the comments section haven't checked this out which is the combat spinner um but today in this video we're going to be checking out this the hologram projector now for me this is level 65 efficiency 366 throwing mythical creates a hologram illusion at an activation point that mimics a player so not long ago i was trolled by this and i didn't realize how it worked so today in this video i want to see if we control people and see if they actually fall for a hologram have you guys ever seen people using this i've seen two people two people using this so let me know in the comments section what other gadgets we should check out like i know this is good and i use the x-ray classes all the time we know bees are really really good so there's possibly going to be some other good ones inside of here and then later on down the line guys we're going to have crystal division ruby division adamant division champion division god like division it said they're coming soon how soon pixel gone we want to see it so let's tap on this and let's craft it this is going to be today's gadget of choice so just go into my gadget sec section a second it's gonna get rid of my what's it gonna get rid of it's gonna get rid of my no that's the wrong section this one's gonna get rid of my bees i'm totally okay with that today's loadout ladies and gentlemen sleep mia love this weapon so good at the moment and then we've gone for pulling sucker heroic ep thor hammer although i'm not gonna lie guys i was really tempted in today's video to use the cyclops thing we're not gonna i'm gonna use conductive souls and the dark mage wand if you guys want to see some more gadgets reviews you know what you gotta do hit that like button let's get into this first game it's a triple bite however though maybe this is gonna be a really really good one that we can kind of trick again i've never used this and i'm hoping we can bait a couple of people so they're gonna spawn there i'm gonna go straight in here i'm gonna know exactly where they're at i'm gonna have to wait to use my other gadget though aren't i there yeah they know dudes see i'm happy to run down the clock i'm happy to run down so i leave this here are they shooting it i don't think they are i don't think they're shooting it i need to get a shot with this come on is he gonna be tricked i don't know he killed he killed the gadget she so kind of worked it kind of worked yes it kind of worked let's put this here you know what i need guys you know what i need don't you i need to use invisibility with this i don't know where he's at though i have actual x-ray activated and i don't see him oh i think he's waiting to get his gadgets back let's go dude so we did kind of trick him in a way i see bro i see you i see you i see you okay he's low anyway yes let's go i got the x-ray come on there he is we hit him we hit him we hit him once that's all i need to do ready three two one boom okay we need to bait him let's do this see if he falls for it not quite so it kind of worked i'm curious guys right if we can have the hologram plus invisibility but i don't know if they take up the same slot because if they take up the same slot then it's not going to work gg i'll take that though guys because we did beat him at one stage because he blew up the hologram so let's go to this gadgets i caught oh i can i can invisibility plus this will be so much better okay let's go again take two this time we're on ice palace we're playing admin who has a little bit more trophies than me so let's let's see how this one starts they're not even loaded in there they are hi hi hi get him once oh okay this dude can uh get away from the conductor of souls i'ma do it i'm gonna do it right there and then i i need to go invisible too let's see let's see if we can get them to fall to fall for it come on shoot the echo admin died okay i think they're behind me they see it they see the hologram they were shooting the hologram it does work i found my new favorite thing to troll people with like straight up though sorry bro not on my watch all right i need to hold like a scarier weapon when i'm doing this what oh the voodoo doll got me hold on hold on guys let's cancel this cancel cancel cancel let's hold like this and then do it come um yes that was a terrible one i need them not i need them not to see me if i'm doing this because as soon as they see me it gives it away oh this guy behind me right let's go we got him anyway yeah i need to hide it's it sucks that i can't have both my gadgets activated sorry bro i'm not on duty and this could be really good for deathmatch too so we'll definitely do a little bit of experimenting today maybe this is an underrated weapon gadget thing guys i'm gonna leave that there they don't seem to be around it's pretty cool though i like it it's actually small it's actually smart business but i think invisibility i'd i'd rather have the x-ray but still where to try two games two wins game number three there's another dude with more trophies than me but again it means nothing in pixel guns 3ds these days so let's see how we get on all i got to do here is make sure i hit this guy with uh this the sleep mirror and then we're good there we go we know where he's at now right let's go that was so laggy then by the way i'm gonna stay invisible for a second what what what was that spawn that was weird you guys see that that was a weird one okay i don't know where this guy is at but let's um i need to kill him where you at boy this is where i do need my x-ray because this dude is i don't know where he's at he's obviously hiding let's get my x-ray out okay there he is i don't know what you're trying to do i don't know what he's trying to do for reals though but uh yeah okay you know what it's time for guys time for bait let's see if he falls for it he's falling for it too bad i didn't have my had enough bullets ready i didn't have bullets ready for him dude he fell for it this is good okay so people do fall for it it's because they're not used to seeing it guys sorry bro today is not your day you can try all you want but today is not gonna be your day so good for bait man i love it he's above me he's above me i can i can smell him see if he falls for it i'm out i need you to fall for it come which was the real one no it was a hard math to do it because he was playing really weird he wanted to kill me and hide the whole entire game no my duty okay let's try one more game and then we'll switch it up to death match well this demon guy has 8.2 k trophies doesn't want to fight me for a chest i like to offer just a little bit of a chest but i think people are scared because of how uh stupid some some sets are in this game let's all right let's let's see where he's at he's over there okay okay okay let's do that these are two echoes now do you know that do you notice two echoes hit them once no that was not good don't think so bro okay we're invisible too come on come on one more let's go not on my watch bro all i need to do is hit him with this dude he's screwed there you go and when he comes to me just get out of there no no i was gonna bait him underneath i got a little bit of an idea with this guys i got a little bit of an idea a little idea here ready let's see if that's there i don't think he's gonna fall for it this guy's not stupid he's not stupid you're annoying me though he's annoying me the way he plays he's just relying on his thor hammer there we go not this time bro see if he shoots it i'm out i'm out i can play the same way bro i can play the same way i got the same tools doesn't know where i'm at doesn't know where i'm at doesn't know where i'm at come on no no no no oh that's painful guys gg i think i don't think i didn't get that kill that kill didn't register man i would have won two he didn't fall for it we'll play demon he didn't fall for it gg though i was i didn't think i was gonna well played i didn't think i was gonna play a guy who would rely on the trampolines usually people don't but guys in three games i feel like we successfully managed to troll three people let's see how we got on death match yeah but on deathmatch though i'm changing my gadget because this thing nah i think x-ray is a little bit better just just a little bit let's go again so i was trolled on this map with it one time this was a map this was the map where i was trolled so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna leave this here get rid of that guy and just see if anybody gets see if anyone falls for it on come on that's a bad idea especially when they spawn there i think they were shoot i did i do think they shot my hologram it's hard to tell man when there's so many people let's get rid of him two dudes here let's go it's gonna be hard to kill all of these okay okay let's try it no he destroyed it no what ah he's right next to me what else is shooting me sorry bro let's go i'm audi i'm audi i'm audi let's go put that there i gotta reload i gotta reload i'm so dead there's so many people here i'm so dead i don't know how i'm still alive i'm out i'm out i'm out x-ray i don't know how that still goes through the wall that's so broken let's go the dude's still still chill chilling there that guy's dead hologram down let's go they're shooting the hologram they were shooting the hologram don't cry sammy don't cry i'm trying to look underneath the stairs guys i literally can't see properly at least they fall they fell for it ah anti-modules not good what's this guy doing dead man i'm i'm third place now guys yeah we can use some triple bite man come on guys is that me is that me is that a fake me i just killed a fake me maybe he's a real me i don't know that was what was going on in that game by the way her game was chaos we did troll of we did kind of bait one person into thinking it was a real me but it's hard when there's so many people to fake me what wait what paradise resort let's go guys let's go let's go let's get rid of him so i have a little bit of an idea for this one guys i have a really really cool idea um first thing is right let's get to this floor here and let's put this guy here right looks like me and then i'm gonna stand up here and get kills and this is how it's gonna work they're not gonna know they're not gonna know who's the real one there's two of us just chilling let's go and see if they killed my gadget yet though did they kill my gadget yeah they did but this is a really really good way i've convinced people uh oh that's someone's pet is there somebody else in this building somebody else up here already no it's not come on come on there we go i'm in number one i hate the triple bite and all those things and that's not even the triple bike it's the other one okay who's your pet this guy all right we can bait people a bit now guys let's go down to the next one i'm gonna put my gadget here and then we're gonna go up and then when my gadget gets destroyed i know that there come on come on hit him once there we go smelly spammers bro i think my gadget is still there is it still there is it done it might have been no it's still there yes somebody somebody thought it was me don't let him don't let him he's just trying to get constant kills let's go i gotta reload this too dude this is a really good way to do it like like this one but if we do it like here oh no bro stole it come on well at least we beat the melee spammers that's all i care about there but that worked though that worked because we didn't die we only died one out of the four times that we were up there so yeah starting to get a little bit better with this war of toys there's only two of us in here great i think it must be a new game nope they're all joining let's try this let's see if he gets fooled no he destroyed he destroyed the echo where is this guy bro where is where was he he was in the air okay that makes so much more sense couldn't see him man i gave away my hologram then where's he gone they're bees oh boy okay is that kind of lobby huh i thought we were in an innocent kind of lobby but no dude what is this lobby why are these guys so cracked let's try and bait there we go i got you just destroyed come on here we go man this is a rough start guys all right let's go up top because it's like the best place i can probably use my gadget we're going to win this bro this is my lobby now he's coming up okay maybe not maybe maybe we got another chance there's a fake echo there let's go pull me up there we go aha i got you marked now though boy wish to gadget i i swear this guy just somehow finds me every single time i'm dead i'm so dead i'm so dead yeah don't stand a chance there blew that guy to bits there he is there he is there he is he's target mock does he just stays target mock for me guys or everybody else too let's do it bait let's see if anyone falls for it nope he didn't he just ran straight past there we go we got him the other dudes also come down now my gadget is still just chilling there reload there we go i'm not sure i got the kill what's the score here nah i'm not gonna get this one guys this guy's a little bit cracked out of his skull releasing the bees into the wild this guy like really has a vendetta for me every time i kill him he comes after me oh i would have been such a good shot too dude oh double kill let's go let's go this is the wrong lobby for me to try this guys this gadget does not suit this lobby ah dude behind me well we secured a second either way maybe not yeah easy easy peasy second place i think the best place is probably duels death match it works a little bit but it's not the best place at all let's go bro i'll take that kill that was kind of correct out of his mind wasn't he what's the woke up and out of swedenbox yeah the best place for this is definitely duels you could do it in lobbies like this but it's not as efficient in duels people are like well there's only two of us so it looks like him could be him let's try it again let's see if we can bait this guy right let's do it let's go up here let's put this here let's go over here let's wait let's wait and see if he falls for the bait there he is he did he really fell for it though now he knows now i don't think so bro we got him dudes we baited him pretty hard okay come on you didn't even see me like i didn't even see me pulling the kill let's go oh dude i'm so sorry that we baited this guy man at the same time dude it's so cool like this gadget is really really really really cool though put it there it's it's such a cool gadget to mess around with it's really weird seeing myself too it's it's cool it's cool it's cool way to mess around though he's like which is the real one we could still leave that there you know what i could do guys i'll go up here right he left he raged quit echo he rage quit dude this is quite convincing though not gonna lie like it can be quite quite convincing ah we got him we made him quit that's the kind of thing i wanted to do today just to see if it worked and he got baited not a lot of people use this gadget so guys give it a go like it trolled me when i first seen it and i can confirm in today's video it will most certainly troll a couple of people if you guys did enjoy today's video be sure to hit that like button have a great day and i'll see you next time bye bye", "G3QVf8WfZDM": "[Music]

no", "w3i8i-9bjqI": "hey there welcome to farmcraft this is a gear but not just any gear this is a bronze herringbone gear these are notoriously hard to make but i was able to make this easily quickly with minimal skill and cheaply and i'm going to show you how to do it too basically anything that you can 3d print you can reproduce in metal at home let me say that again anything you can 3d print you can reproduce in metal i'm talking about bronze brass copper aluminum even cast iron this is an amazingly powerful technique what i'm talking about is lost pla casting pla is the thermoplastic that is commonly used for 3d printing it's polylactic acid i'm going to take you through the whole process in this video show you everything you need to know and all the equipment that you're going to need so to start out with this is called a loop pole and this would attach like on a door or a hatch or something on a boat and it would allow you to then pull that open it's my parents old wooden boat and this broke and they couldn't find a place that they could buy bronze ones they found them in stainless steel but that wouldn't match the boat so they asked me if i could make a bronze one and i thought that would be a perfect time to to use this technique now this part could be made in a lot of ways but it's not the simplest of parts and i'm just talking about this piece here it has an angle on it to help you hook your finger now how could you make that there's several options you could get some quarter inch bronze you could cut out the shape drill a hole and file it that would take you some time and have you priced bronze lately that would be pretty expensive you could use some bronze tubing and basically on a blade you could you could make the round part and then you could braise on this tab and that would work fine you could probably even get the brazing to match well enough that it wouldn't be that obvious and you could sand cast it to be fair this would be a relatively easy part to sand cast you'd have to add some draft and then do some filing at the end but we're going to make this with lost pla so i'm using fusion 360 to make this part now if the part that you want to make already exists you can just download it on the internet and you don't have to do any of this this designing but fusion 360 is free and it's not it's not too hard to learn basically you sketch out the outline and then you extrude it and here i'm adding some angles to the edges and then i go underneath and i add that angle to make it easy to hook with your finger and there you go i send it over to my 3d printer mine is a creality cr10 so there you go i've got it suspended in a cup and i left this end long that's going to be the pour spout and the idea is that i'm going to put plaster all around that and let it set in place then i'm going to burn the pattern out then we're going to fill it full of bronze now certainly possible that there's air bubbles and that's not going to be a great mold but i don't know it's pretty fluid right now and it you know i was pounding it down i think maybe that'll work and if that's going to work you know good enough is good enough there's no reason to make it harder than it needs to be so we'll give that a try this is just a little electric tabletop furnace first i'm going to dry out the mold i'm just going to do this at 100c for a couple hours i'm going to go ahead and invert it over this pan because as i raise the temperature the plastic is going to start dripping out i've been at around 240 for the last few hours uh that's fahrenheit so that should have driven off all the water in the mold so we are going to go up to 450 degrees now all right it's been at 450 for several hours now nothing really exciting to see in there so we are gonna take it up now i'm gonna go actually just take it up to 1200. so i may have messed it up when i cranked it up to 1200 it might have been too fast there you can see how cracked up it is but the cracks don't look like they're penetrating all the way to the center um it's such a small simple part i'm going to go ahead and try and pour it so here's some bronze it's actually from their boat uh some bronze from a piece of trim or something that they replaced so let's put that in the crucible and we'll start heating that up try and give this a pour and i have to be fast because it's such a small amount of metal i know it's going to cool very quickly yeah went right through the plaster that's all right it doesn't always work the first time lesson learned i poured it in the top there but it all just came out the bottom you can see where the metal just poured out of the side it's surprising i had part of my ring at least i made something the tape keeps this from pushing it down too far but then that's enough weight to just keep it right where it is so that looks good then it cracked too that's frustrating i have no idea why that cracked what i'm thinking is maybe i need to do like a soup can a steel can around it so that i can do the burnout with the plaster supported i'm not sure if that's the best solution though so you notice there was no pour spout on there that's because i completed the burnout and you're supposed to keep it hot when you're pouring the pore temperature for the mold is 1100 degrees fahrenheit the burnout temperature was around 1300 so once i finished the burnout i just turned it down to 1100 melted my metal and poured it in well that didn't give me a chance to do anything to the mold to make a nice little pour spout i suppose i could 3d print something into the pattern i have a feeling it actually didn't go down into the cavity if i was big stack d i'd have a giant block of ice he seems to have an endless supply of those to cool this off but i'm just a farmer so we're going to use the bucket for a protein pail so if you guys haven't seen big stack d and you like watching uh melting metal you should check him out he makes melting metal fun hey look at that it's in the bottom of the mold did it fill ha that's freaking awesome i can't believe that worked can you see the lines in it you can actually see the 3d printing lines like that thing got really really detailed [Music] a common question i get is why don't you just use the item that you're trying to reproduce to make your mold and and this actually makes that example the answer is here was my mold and here's my result this is bigger than this even if i hadn't filed or sanded or anything it was significantly smaller and that's because the molten metal is this size as it's molten but then when it cools it shrinks so you end up with a smaller part than your original so you have to take that into account when you're making your pattern uh how much additional do you need you know if you wanted it to be exactly this in final dimensions you're going to need to add enough for shrinking and then also enough for finishing you know you're going to be able to want to sand it and smooth it and make it look look right i just put a cotter pin through there and there you have it that measures 1.457 this is 1.49 35 000 difference this is bigger than this bronze is real easy to patina i boiled an egg crushed it up and put it in a bag with this in there and that's the patina it gave it so there you go here's your loop pull so that was kind of cool admittedly not the coolest thing in the world because that could have been made just with sand casting let's make something cooler this is a herringbone gear so it's a combination helical gear a helical gear meaning the teeth are at an angle gives you advantages in that it can run faster it can handle higher loads than just a straight tooth gear but the problem with the helical gear is if the teeth are all in one direction and you're driving it this way well that's going to create a force in one direction so there's thrust on a helical gear that you have to have to deal with well this design gets rid of that problem because there's the angles are in both directions these are very hard to make look at that how do you make that how would you sand cast that well you can't cast it you can't sand cast it like it is you could split it in two and do two halves and generally that's how they're done you make the two halves and then you bolt them together but even if you picture just the bottom half there even removing that from the sand you would have to unscrew it from the sand you would have to pull it at that angle these are challenging to make but with this method it should be a piece of cake so let's give it a try i've printed a pour spout i'm going to fill the plaster up to there so basically i'm going to hot glue it like that and this is going to hold it in position while the plaster is setting 400 grams of powder to 160 grams of water this one i'm gonna put the plaster in first this is just an old ceramic kiln i got this on craigslist i think i spent it was either 100 or 150 bucks i put some insulation on it it probably wasn't necessary but i had it just to uh just to make it more efficient this has a ramp and soak function which means you can program it to set a temperature and then slowly increase to another temperature and then hold it level at that temperature and then go up some more which is exactly what i need to do with this so that's going to make cooking off automatic basically i put it in i hit go and i walk away come back 12 hours later and it'll be it'll have done all the work for me so for not much money you can look around on craigslist these things are uh are very plentiful and super useful all right so i'm ready to do the burnout so here's my mold setting it on something so that the gases have room to get out i don't want to just set it flat on the bottom so that's going to follow the recommended burnout cycle for this plaster which is this prestige oro you can see in the first hour it goes up to 300 it holds that for three hours then over another hour it goes to 700 holds that for two over two hours it goes all the way up to 1382 fahrenheit and holds that for four and then comes down to 1100 degrees is a poor temperature there you go that's how much bronze i'm gonna melt and that should be more than enough far more than i need to do these two molds so couple interesting things here i poured the small gear first and it came out really nice you know good filling of the mold on both sides top and bottom the bottom might be a little sharper than the top like those are a little bit blunted that's probably because of air pushing back not allowing the metal to completely fill the mold now i could maybe help that if i put a riser a pour spout and a riser to allow the air to escape commercially you would use a vacuum pump you basically when you're pouring you have on the bottom of your mold a suction so that it actually pulls the metal into the mold and pulls the air out making it easier to fill the mold but i'm real pleased with that especially considering i didn't even vacuum now the bigger one i poured second and you can see i have much more blunting at the tops so this one had trouble filling the mold uh more than that one did i think the metal was probably cooling off because of that it was freezing and and not pushing the air out like it did on this one maybe i could have worked a little faster now here's an interesting thing i had some air bubbles now those were in the mold those were in the plaster looks like you could just scrape those right off but they're they're cast in there they're not going anywhere there you can see the blunting on the top of the teeth and the smaller gear no air bubbles and the teeth are sharper a little blunt on top overall though these would be expensive parts if you needed one so let's talk equipment this is my 3d printer it's a creality cr10 and it's a it's got a pretty big capacity on it it's a it's a pretty nice printer printers are getting cheaper and cheaper you can get a printer on amazon right now brand new for 150 bucks but people are always upgrading their printers too so if you want a printer and you look around for used you're probably going to be able to get a certainly a decent printer for a hundred dollars this ceramic kiln with a little effort and if you're patient i think you'll be able to find one of these on craigslist or facebook marketplace for 100 bucks bucks they'll probably list it for more but i bet you'd be able to get it for that this controller for doing burnouts is awesome it's 75 bucks i wish i could say it was cheaper but man it's so worth it you'll also need a solid state relay i'll i'll leave links to all that in the description so now you need a way to melt your metal i was using this little furnace this was 500 it's nice i got it because i wanted to be able to very precisely control temperatures and very easily do small melts and it just makes it so easy when it's electric i can just set the temperature to 2000 and off it goes and the crucible is this crucible it's not a it's not a lot of material but it's quite it's quite a bit and it takes about half hour to melt it i can put it in and just walk away it is very convenient i've got a video on making this furnace this is a metal five gallon bucket with some kale wool ceramic insulation and i used a harbor freight weed torch as the burner and i used that for a long time i was able to melt up the copper which is 2000 degrees that is certainly an option and uh probably the cheapest one you're gonna have on melting metal and if you want a nicer furnace i've also got a a video on building this big guy there's a there's satanite coating in there and uh and a giant crucible um and then speaking of that crucibles uh that crucible that was in there is probably an 80 crucible this one was probably 15 25 and then 60 or something like that all depends on what size furnace you have what size crucible you're going to need well you can use a furnace like this to do both the pattern burnout as well as melting the metal there's not a lot of room in there and doing them at the same time obviously is troublesome because the temperatures are different it's really nice to have two furnaces one for the pattern and then one for the metal so for a bare minimum price list the printer would be a hundred dollars the electric kiln with controller would be 200 the basic furnace would be 100 a crucible would be 25 and the plaster is 50. that is 25 pounds of plaster that would be enough to do about 25 soup can type molds so i know people are gonna say uh you know hey that's not cheap that's five hundred dollars or even up to a thousand dollars um well i guess it's all relative this is my mill right here that was twenty five hundred dollars so just the mill costs a heck of a lot more than what you would need uh to do what i'm what i'm talking about here yeah i mean i'm not saying this stuff's free you're not going to go to a junkyard and be doing this but um it's certainly doable so i have some ideas of some interesting things i could make using this technique but i'm curious what you guys are thinking can you think of anything you'd like to see me make post a comment down below let me know what you're thinking i also want to mention that i've been approached several times by companies to put ads in my videos and i really hate ads and videos um so i have i have not done that i want to really thank my patreon supporters for supporting me they really help making it so that i don't have to turn to ads and things like that so if you guys are appreciative of the content if you learn something with the video and you want to help the channel you can join me on patreon would be awesome you can also just share and like the video that would be really helpful i hope you guys learned something useful we'll see you next time you", "-Bp8OnLpcYc": "okay it's time to start [Music] hey you why are you so

look at rocky okay he looks like that okay let me try this oh uh he's gonna be a little smaller than i thought he might be but that's okay it's still gonna look good okay you're making me a little bit worried with how you're sweating so much i should be able to fix this just let me add some like rocky colored paint on it okay yeah yeah yeah just put some paint on it that'll fix it spray it there and okay there it is there's rocky that's the rocky a pet ball we're out of here i'm going to leave you a one star yelp review what is up guys welcome to this episode i'm monkey box yeah today we're doing the new burst provers hacker challenge in wood turning 3d okay wood turning 3d now i guess we have a little like wood turning shop or something like that a woodwork shop whoa dude maybe we'll find stinky off for 260 bucks okay we gotta oh we gotta carve like a rocket or something for him oh so they're gonna pay you 260 dollars if you do a good job wait this is so satisfying whoa wait that's so satisfying wait how do you can you just chisel whoa whoa whoa you got it dude you got it yeah you have to like drag it so it's like actually kind of hard to like keep it in the right spot yeah you're right bro wait this is so satisfying way and you can use different chisels this angle will probably help on this yeah you're right it's like more precise wait this is so sick oh wait wait wait wait wait wait it's saying repair maybe i did this wrong oh no oh oh oh oh oh you got it wait repair what what happened apparently i messed it up but this looks pretty good to me i don't know what the problem is yeah guys like we said this is new first provers hacker right now we are on the noob so we're just trying to figure out how this game is played dude okay i should have just stuck with the original chisel i think this is more accurate yeah oh it looks good though i mean that looks pretty good to me bro okay now use a sponge i don't know what this sponge is even for probably like smooth it out yeah oh what i gotta smooth it out for it's fine bro oh this is so satisfying wow it really does smooth it out okay cool nice that's good that's good oh wait what color did you want i forgot oh i'll make it i'm gonna get foxy purple i'll make it foxy purple i think it was green but i can't remember this is so satisfying yeah what okay we better get uh all 260 for this that's perfect reveal stencil wait this is a stencil oh cool no wow accuracy yes wait we got our friends we got 300. he he left us a tip wow nice go wow okay i like this game dude i like this game a lot okay okay 260 bucks she wants a dumbbell okay oh cool wait this is really difficult i'm gonna try to be smart i'ma try and work from the outside in you know what i mean oh that's real smart that's real smart why is it saying repair dude i didn't mess anything up stop it stop it maybe it gives you the opportunity to like redo it uh if you want to watch an ad or something oh i have it messed up though it looks pretty good yeah looking good to me oh man i like how it even like it even puts like more like wood shavings when you like go more aggressively right like look at that look at that it's so satisfying wait this is so satisfying guys this game is sick rocky says i'm glad it's wood carving and not rock carving and by the way guys if you want to get your own boxy foxy rocky plushy head to lankyboxshop.com we actually have new merch coming very soon like new t-shirts and new lanky box posters guys these things are insane we got one for each of the characters boxy foxy and rocky so check those out lankybachshop.com bro this dumbbell look at how perfect this dumbbell is bro it's so nice wait this game is so satisfying i feel like i'm actually carving a piece of wood even though i'm just playing an app you know yeah okay let's make it green this time green for money money wait the paint is like shiny it's so realistic wait this is so sick okay let's go let's go let's go okay i'm gonna reveal this pattern again oh so you can unlock more patterns later oh cool i'm probably going to take a shake dumbbell okay wait apparently we didn't get the accuracy what are you talking about hmm well wait let's see what we can buy with the money we're making yeah good idea let's go let's go to the shop okay so you can get different tools but i like the normal tool you can get different sponges that's it i don't want a sponge that's all you get chisels and sponges let's try and get a new uh tool when we can't we need a 1.1 k okay here we go all right oh they want a bag of money okay oh cool wait now we have to use different tools because it's like curved yeah it looks like it's almost like metal oh it is metal oh wait wait this game is much harder wait how am i supposed to do this bro what does it just take a lot harder like it takes longer to chisel because it's metal no it's just like how do i make this like curved shape that they want oh you just got to try your best oh i messed up that's bad oh that's really bad what am i doing no you're doing fine you got to just go farther in yeah there you go bro i'm stressed out this game stressing me out bro you got it okay okay okay okay it's offering me a reward it thinks i messed up okay no you're doing all right you're doing great okay this looks okay this looks okay we're definitely gonna need to use the sponge here because this is not perfect okay yeah guys the levels got a lot harder it started off really easy and now this is like already much harder yeah dude this is so satisfying though whoa that looks good that looks really good oh okay this part looks a little indented that's fine don't worry i'll smooth it out i'll smooth it out don't worry i'll smooth it out i'm gonna use the sponge okay i'm gonna smooth it out nice nice smooth it out yeah good idea we're really sponging out a piece of metal that makes sense wow it looks so much smoother yeah you're right this is awesome okay now now what do we do now we're gonna paint it let's paint it orange for like boxy let's go boxy gold you can do different colors oh yeah try that i'll do boxy a boxy yellow and foxy purple i'll do both i'll give him a cool whoa that's cool guys wait that's actually so sick okay let's use this stencil whoa wow 100 let's go and i think one more customer you have enough money to buy a new tool i think so i think you're right okay this person oh yeah you upgrade your your metal thing okay i don't really know what that does all right they want like a vase or something okay let's go wait why does it say you're still a newbie level one up top wait yo we're still level one bro i think there was an option to pass customers and so maybe you have to pass until you get like a more tricky customer and then you'll level up faster oh but anyway we'll get angry maybe we're just still on like the basic customers got it yo this is so satisfying i don't even care yet this is so sick yeah that's right look at that okay okay okay oh i kind of messed up there a little bit that's okay it's okay it's okay oh yeah this is nice okay yeah so i do think you got to smooth it out with the sponge make it nice and smooth nice really nice and smooth oh that looks so sick i would pay a lot of money for that if i had a lot of money yeah you can put all your salads in it dude i'm gonna make it a rainbow base i'm gonna put every single color on it bro this is such a satisfying game i love how it's like shiny and reflective that's like the best part yeah wait i love this all right cool cool cool let's give it okay and i'm gonna peel away the stencil nice that is sick that's sick wow 100 accuracy let's go okay let's see how to skip customers like adam was saying i don't think i don't think you skip them dude i think you have to play until you level up well say say upgrade your thing okay upgrade i okay i upgraded it nice and then say tap to play and then someone's gonna oh wait we're level two we're level two and say next offer i don't think that's gonna help us level up bro maybe like the different people will offer you more money for harder okay i hope she doesn't get angry oh she oh okay over yeah he offered more money wait so yeah maybe you gotta turn people down i think so yeah okay so far i'm liking the pointy chisel the most although i can't use it here wow you actually have to switch tools whoa i you literally could not have done this part with the pointy chisel wow yeah you're right bro imma use the pointy chisel to go around this line really carefully and then i'll go back to the flat chisel i feel like i actually have some sort of skill you do have skill not really it's just eating you always say that you have skills to pay the bills i do it's eating i switched the chisel and it did that on accident i didn't do that i didn't mean to do that that's probably why it has the repair ad thing where you can like redo it but we're not gonna do that we're gonna lose money for that that wasn't my fault i didn't mean to it's okay thanks adam that means a lot i think i think we'll still get max points for this please please please yeah just just smooth it out item that's all right just hide it with paint hide it with yeah exactly this is so sick the paint is one of my favorite parts it's all shiny yeah i wonder if 10 is the max level in this game no way but it only shows 2 out of 10 so i don't know we got max accuracy on that he didn't even notice i took a little bit off the side whatever okay let's see what they got 260 next offer nah nah nah 286 nice okay we're going for the people that pay the most money okay she wants a bottle made out of wood okay i don't know about that one okay we're gonna use the flat chisel here gonna go across oh that's so satisfying that is so satisfying okay wow now i'm gonna change i'm gonna change to the pointy chisel so that i can do a precision precision line right here you got wow wow wow this is satisfying bro dude we gotta try that blindfolded later in the video okay adam you you'll help me on that one all right here we go sponge sponge sponge and we're gonna paint it i'll paint it i'll paint it purple cool paint it purple and i think when you put all the colors you get a higher score nice it looks good nice this looks so sick okay okay let's turn it in reveal the stencil reveal the stencil nice spice okay i'm gonna upgrade my shop okay are they gonna pay me more money now oh we're level three let's see if we can get to level 10 bro all right 260 all right next offer next offer okay frying pan 286 okay i can do that i can do that all right let's go let's go let's go all right i'm using the pointy chisel is the best tool so far guys i i i'm gonna actually try and save up and see if we can get another tool yeah good idea because maybe they have better shapes that are even easier to use okay we're making a little i don't even know what this oh it's a frying pan right it's actually like a vase i wonder if you keep like skipping customers if they'll eventually start paying you like more and more and more should i just skip a bunch of customers yeah just see like who's the most expensive customer there is okay you got it you got it what is this it's not a vase is this like a hammer or is it like meant to be like a like a percussion instrument what is this bro yeah i think it's like a baby's rattle wow yeah like a rattle nice nice nice nice nice 100 dirty yeah all right let's start skipping customers until we get a very high spender okay let's see if we can just start skipping what we're gonna get we're skipping to the chicken as the shirt says okay let's skip let's skip hey 260. 286.99 315 oh wait this is the best offer i have to accept this oh click best offer oh then you watch an ad then someone else will pay you more we gotta try it all right let's go okay oh the vip offer is 472 dollars wow wait adam's a genius so guys that is the pro and hacker move the pro move is to skip until you get the second in line person the second to last person because then that's like one of the best but the hacker move is to watch a ad yeah i should have seen that coming who would have thought the hacker move is almost always watch ads whoa i don't know what he's gonna have you make here that's like an egg yeah it looks like an egg in some sort of cup maybe it's a trophy maybe he won the triwizard tournament in harry potter and this is the trophy egg eater ever that's me silly item oh no oh i messed it up oh that's all right please don't give me max max money mr eggman come on oh wait i'ma change i'm gonna change the size of the sponge so i can get in this little small area oh nice oh that's smart wait this game is actually too high iq bro i'll make a thick sponge sand it here sand it here oh yeah that's a nice egg that's a nice egg i'm gonna paint the whole thing okay here we go make sure i don't miss anything for our vip client here looks good i'm making a rainbow colored egg wow he deserves nothing but the best cause he's paying a lot of money and i bet uh when he pays you the money you'll have enough to buy a new tool i think you're right let's go let's go please please give us something nice mr eggman please 538 let's go let's try and upgrade a tool right now yeah let's see let's go let's go what is it going to be please a good tool please oh yeah wait this is like even more accurate than the than the triangle one and we really like the triangle one yeah or you can watch an ad get even another tool should we do it yeah let's try it let's do it okay let's see what we got we got another tool here come on please be cool whoa what is that shape wow that's awesome wait these new tools are so sick okay now as we learned let's just skip everybody until we get the most expensive now 260 nah nah yeah not worth it nah 286 nah 3 15 9 watch another ad let's go okay this person's offering whoa 472 for a birthday cake wait our new tools are gonna come in super

candle bro whoa bro look at that yeah that is so sick wait where's my other chisel oh i'm gonna use this new pointy one the green one oh this looks so sick yeah it's really good this one's really good it's so precise look at that wow wait these new tools are so good what nice there you go you got it i'm gonna use my new precision tool to get in here how much are they gonna pay i wonder for this i hope about 500 bucks i mean why would they want a wooden birthday cake i don't really know don't termites eat wood maybe she's giving it to some pet termites or something like don'ts yeah wait i

and this is not looking good this is actually looking pretty terrible i don't know if we're gonna win this oh god all right we're starting to push a different lane and we won they can't control all of the lanes and that's where we come in and that's where we win all right where do we start i'm gonna start by using this lane it's gonna be pretty simple we're just gonna use one guy and he's gonna push it all right well uh is he winning are you winning son no you're not you are not winning you're losing your pathetic son you're adopted did i tell you that yet oh my god if you're gonna lose this

cleaner had another dead battery but rather than throw it out or replace it i used the power of 3d printing to make it better than ever [Music] 3d printers are pretty good at printing novelty items and trinkets but they can also potentially save you money recently i shared a dozen 3d printed workshop tools and many people in the comments said they couldn't wait to print them this video is also on practical 3d printing but not necessarily something you'll be able to copy at home instead my aim is to inspire you and show you the possibilities that 3d printing can enable let me start by explaining the problem that i was trying to fix this is a dyson stick vacuum that we've had for many years it's been great and i would honestly recommend them except this one has a dead battery for the second time i've probed the charger and i know that that's working and i also followed a great video guide which i'll link in the description to pull it apart and make sure there was nothing else wrong with it apart from the battery i'd been really happy with this vacuum so i headed to the website to see how much a new one would be and i'd honestly forgotten how expensive they were the new top model easily being over a thousand bucks even this v8 older model was still retailing for 750 australian not wanting to spend that much i headed to ebay and found that a replacement battery would be around 50 but i had done that before and the new battery had failed in time anyway so i had a problem that i could spend my way out of by either spending a little bit of money or quite a lot but i actually took the middle ground and went for another option entirely i have a lot of ryobi cordless tools and noticed they'd added a stick vacuum in australia these retail for 300 bucks so approximately a quarter of the price of a new dyson the reviews on the bunnings website were mixed some people were really happy other people saying that the suction perhaps wasn't so good and other people complaining about the weight and ergonomics saying it was uncomfortable to use nevertheless i took the plunge so how did it go i would say that suction performance was inconsistent sometimes it picked up debris on the first pass but other times it just refused to suck things up particularly when they were large or long the head was a tad bulky and had a spinning brush which i really didn't need for my house but my main complaint was to do with the end that you held in your hand we can see that the angle of the handle was quite different on the dyson and it's also much more streamlined in my personal opinion it's quite comfortable to use however on the ryobi i found myself trying to push with my thumb to get a nicer angle and that became uncomfortable after a few minutes this situation sucked and by that i mean the vacuum just didn't suck well enough to be fair for a quarter of the price the ryobi vacuum worked quite well but i was still dissatisfied and i was also down 300 but let's pretend that that didn't happen and go to the final solution which cost me less than 10 bucks what i already had a lot of was this ryobi one cordless batteries surely using my 3d printer there was a way i could revive the dyson by using these i started with some proof of concept tests making sure there was no circuitry in the battery that prevented devices from being powered from it directly i noted that the ryobi battery was a few volts less than the factory dyson battery i was worried that it might be underpowered in this configuration but connecting them directly suggested by the sound of the motor at least that the difference would be negligible the ryobi batteries have a third terminal however the power tools had no prong to match this terminal so i'm pretty sure it's only used for charging and that means i could ignore it for my vacuum i was ready to proceed and started by summarizing my main design goals the first was pretty obvious and it was creating printed geometry to adapt the new battery the new battery was physically bigger so i needed to make sure i wouldn't interrupt functions such as emptying out the dust to achieve this i might need to experiment with its position number two wasn't so obvious and that's that i needed a new way to switch the vacuum on i discovered when removing the old battery that the power switch for the whole vacuum is actually part of the battery all the switch in the handle does is press the battery switch so i needed a way around this number three was to design a new wall hanger the old hangar had a charging port in built and as you can see is a snug fit any modifications to the back of the vacuum we're gonna stop this system from working number four was a bonus goal and related to an adapter for the vacuum head as you can see this vacuum originally came with a motorized head but we don't have any carpet so instead i was using the slimline head with the high-tech solution of using masking tape to jam the two together this generally worked okay but over time the masking tape would degrade and generally the head was not that secure time to start designing and to model some highly complex geometry this dyson vacuum is one of the most complicated things i've ever had to measure in 3d model it's got beveled surfaces everywhere it's got a lot of intricate details and to make things worse all of the main features are on an angle i use digital calipers for most of my measurements i also use the fillet gauge featured in the 3d printed tools video and i used a humble protractor to try and measure that top angle needless to say i wasn't very confident so i printed a simplified template with all of the mating surfaces in place to see how accurate my measurement had been things actually worked out quite well here all of the mating surfaces that went inside the handle was spot on but it wouldn't quite fit because the red clip was fouling the other end so i took a dremel tool and undertook some fairly dramatic reduction of material and this did the trick i was able to slot the template into place and this gave me confidence that i would be successful from this point forwards so i headed back into cad and added this bulbous area that will give me the internal space for the new battery to slot in i also cut out this mounting surface on the front as you can see on the dyson battery one of the three screw holes is this tall skinny bit to get it stronger i modeled this as a separate part and then also gave him the advantage of refining it with a series of small prints rather than doing this whole piece over and over i measured the connector for the ryobi battery and printed this very quick little template again far better to print this over and over until it matches exactly rather than this whole part once i was confident i had the right dimensions i then put a cutout on the underside and started to think about how i was going to make battery terminals at this point i was determined to solve this problem as cheaply as possible so my original idea of buying a cheap charger and gutting the terminals out of the inside was abandoned i purchased this cheap switch that could handle the current required and i also purchased these spade terminals and all of this was under 10 bucks i modeled the flat terminals into my cad and then printed this screw-on clamp to hold them in place again i designed this part separately because it took a couple of goes to fit just right and it used very little plastic in the waste attempts crimping on these terminals is pretty straightforward i matched the gauge of the original wiring and also bent the edges to help them slide over the battery terminals the female connectors went on the terminals already inside the dyson vacuum i routed my new wiring inside the vacuum and started the most difficult job which was getting the spade terminals into position with some perseverance i managed to jiggle them into place push my printed clamp into position and then use screws to bolt everything in permanently hard to assemble but now very secure this actually represented a major milestone because for the first time i could slide the ryobi battery into place flick the switch and verify that the vacuum was working i let it run for several minutes and made sure the connections were secure and most importantly that they weren't heating up and potentially melting the plastic back into cad to design the next section with this mid section of the body it had room for the wiring to come through and a cutout to push in the switch there was an access hole from the bottom to make this easier but most importantly it had the final sleeve in place to interface with the battery this part was printed on its end to avoid the need for support material and i fitted it by first feeding through the wires to the switch and then engaging the five m4 bolts that go around the outside some of them are tight but all of them are doable now the switch could be plugged in with the terminals and then pushed into the housing ready for another test to make sure everything was working as intended the battery slid in without any dramas and the vacuum turned on as expected back to cad where i was designing this stuff as i went to do the final piece which went on the bottom to clip into the edge of the battery this piece was quick to print and it took me two goes to get the exact fit snapping around the battery holding it securely but releasing when desired it attached with a series of m3 bolts around the perimeter the idea being to use many to spread the load and evenly distribute the weight of the battery with these in place a final test i can insert the battery for real it was a little bit tight the first time but a whack gave the satisfying click the vacuum turned on and the primary part of this project was complete revisiting our four design goals we were already halfway there and the hard work was mainly over because the other two would be a lot easier to satisfy i pulled the old hanger and charger off the wall and started to disassemble it the swiveling piece up the top was easy to remove by flexing the housing and then the charging plug unclipped from there freeing up the main body of our hanger my preference was to retain this part as it held all of the accessories and it would mean a much simpler design job the new holder you can see here in dark blue and it's the simplest part in this whole project precision was nowhere near as important for this part so it was printed on the cr-10 max with 0.6 millimeter nozzle and a 0.4 millimeter layer height it works pretty simply with the whole pattern matching which means it easily bolts onto the existing hanger secures the original accessories and then the actual vacuum cleaner from the top without the battery which is a decision i made to stop my batteries from disappearing number three complete and ticked off the list the final job was this adapter and once again i printed a simple template but this prototype failed because the live hinge snapped off the fitment on either side however was still pretty good my aim was to replicate the sprung latch from the dyson and this worked extremely well i used a spring from a pen or something like that i had lying around and i was extremely pleased to find that it slid in with a satisfying click was secure but could be released with a press of the button and here is my final revision i initially tried this pushing clip it pokes through to the inside to locate on the vacuum cleaner head and it actually held pretty well until you rotated it and then it pops straight out for the redesign i had the same internal structure but this one wrapped much further around and since this side didn't need to detach i used a cable tie to hold it properly in place with this end sorted a dab of super glue to hold the spring in place and a reprint of the latch in red so it stands out and we now have the capability to switch between the factory fittings and our printed adapter at will our fourth and final bonus design goal is satisfied the burning question how does it work well it sucks and by that i mean it's an effective vacuum cleaner the ryobi batteries clip into place just like on an original ryobi tool and despite the voltage being slightly lower the suction seems to be on par with the original vacuum cleaner the printed head adapter so far has withstood bumps with no problems at all obviously at the top of the vacuum things are now a little bit bulkier but they're not necessarily heavier with the standard battery being just over half a kilo a smaller airbnb battery being 100 grams less and a large one around 200 grams more i was concerned that the longer battery would smash into my pelvis but so far that hasn't been an issue either oh and we managed to keep the bin emptying function perfect without the new geometry interfering the battery life is actually longer than the battery i replaced and when it does run out instead of putting the whole vacuum on the charger for hours i can just hot swap a new battery and keep going it's just too bad that i did spend the money on this ryobi vacuum but for the money it's really not too bad and i think it will do quite well in the workshop or to take camping i realise a vacuum cleaner project doesn't really sound that exciting but because i put in the effort and because it worked out quite well i found it immensely satisfying if you've got a project like that please share it with me and

nintendo took platforming into a whole new dimension mario sunshine embraced its tropical theme and introduced a game-changing flood device mario galaxy went sickle mode on us bringing in dozens of inventive gravity-defying mechanics then with mario 3d world mario was now in 3d like how he had been for 17 years now and he could turn into a cat the concept behind 3d world was confusing and underwhelming with 3d land nintendo wanted to translate mario galaxy into a handheld game and i think they did a pretty good job but then wii u comes out and we go okay what's the next big mario game and it's a bigger version of the handheld version of mario galaxy but without the 3d effect of the 3ds but it's still called 3d world for me this game is a lot easier to appreciate now that we have odyssey all the things that were disappointing to me back when it released are now the same things that make it so distinct from the other titles like the fixed camera one of the major things people seem to struggle with in the older games is the camera having to control mario and the camera at the same time just doesn't click for some people so mario galaxy said okay you don't got to worry about the camera anymore we're going to go into every single level and script out 100 different cameras so that no matter where you are the camera is in the perfect spot galaxy opened the door to more linear design and 3d world walked right through the trade-off is you get to experience new ideas much faster at the cost of the freedom you had in mario 64. you still have the back flip somersault long jump spin jump and some no moves you'd let us see an odyssey like the ground pound jump and the mario rule but none of your moves here move you very far they're mostly just included as a flourish even more so the galaxy this game is heavily reliant on stages to make movement interesting world one we already got my jam on here [Music] immediately you are turned into cat mario as the cat you can dive across the map and climb up walls like spider-man where [ __ ] gets real though is when they bring in the wall treadmill oh this is cool why is there a treadmill installed on the side of a wall don't you ever ask these kinds of questions you also have the see-through pipe which is like the green pipe but a hundred times better in every single way green pipe you gotta press down let the animation play out fade to black fade in animation out of the pipe the clear pipe says no boy we going big mode now you just slide in there so seamless and you can see mario glide down the pipe with this squeaky sound effect sometimes he can be controlled while in the pipe sometimes it'll guide you through a scenic transition and then as soon as he pops out the other side you're in control that's such a beautifully executed mechanic 3d world is kind of like the sonic generations of mario with the developers remixing all of their favorite ideas from the entire series into one big combo meal and this approach would carry over into odyssey you have rabbits and slides from 64 where you ride on yoshi's brother yonka dingo the shoe power-up finally returns from mario 3 as an ice skate you can jump through clouds like sunshine extendo blocks from 3d land and galaxy there was just so much borrow dna from that game rhythm levels switch pads platforms that flip when you jump captain toad thinks he's getting killed off by doug bowser but it's just wooden bowser you freaking [ __ ] puff pride peeks is where you realize that the wii u gamepad was created just for you to play this one level to move the fan platforms you actually blow onto the gamepad then these little goombas pop up and you go see you buddy look at how badass this is you jump off the spring into the litter box the sand slows mario down giving the condor a slight edge then you go up this hill so clean with that part now you're at fucko's past the birds make you want to move faster but if you go too fast you'll slip off then you gotta trick this guy into pecking the brick bounce up the sand waterfall and then gun it down these shuffle platforms to the flag beautiful stage not every level in 3d world is perfect but it's insane how many perfect levels are in this game the roller coaster like switchboard falls there's a mario kart themed level trampoline level circus trapeze you can kick an exploding soccer ball into a tower of goombas zoom over spinning terrain there's a stealth level there's an oreo level double cherry pass if you don't like this level you can kiss my ass the double cherry has got to be the best power up in mario history you can control two three four five six marios at the same time and then you gotta somehow manage to get them all to the end of the stage i really love this slide part where if you're good enough you can swap your marios to the other side without even jumping at some point you just have to ask how how is there more ideas in the first two hours of this game than most aaa games can show you in 60 hours well because you aren't playing a [ __ ] ass game anymore you're playing a mario king so you", "bMeBvrG9Uyo": "photo editing software allows users to perform 2d edits such as moving scaling and rotating segments in the image in the real world what are you still having objects like this chair in a hands-on fashion well let's take them turning them around knocking them over we present an approach that allows users to perform 3d manipulations of objects and photographs by using publicly available 3d models here we use our approach to manipulate the chair in 3d and put it back in place next to the sofas three models for many everyday objects are already available on the Internet however directly using the geometry and appearance of 3d models from public repositories produces an artificial looking result texture mapping the photographed pixels is problematic as well the geometry doesn't line up the illumination is unknown and hidden parts of the object are exposed our approach couples the 3d model with the photographed pixels to produce seamless 3d edits notice how our results seamlessly breaks away from the original photograph to reveal its hidden areas two pairs of parallel lines specify the ground plane the user aligns and corrects the 3d model by providing point correspondences between the 3d model and the photographed object we estimate an illumination model from the visible pixels and the geometry of the object using a von mises Fisher basis with smoothness and sparsity priors we could now produce shadows and illumination changes on the object as it moves we use symmetries and the stop model texture to hallucinate hidden thoughts of the object from the visible areas we can now have 3d control of objects in the photograph for instance we can create dynamic compositions traditional CAD tools such as Maya can now be used to animate a single photograph we simulate a depth of field effect using the object step map here is an example from saying at all while their method produces photorealistic edits they are unable to reveal hidden areas of the laptop we reimagine typical photo editing tasks in 3d such as copy paste and rotation our tool can also be used to beat New York traffic when symmetries cannot fill the appearance we use the stock model appearance to render for instance the underside of the taxi cab our method does not handle complex material interactions such as translucency yet the results can up your acceptable our approach can also be used to manipulate objects and non-photorealistic media such as paintings in this historical world war ii photograph the user realizes the planes and manipulates them to create the effect of the planes veering towards the camera our approach can also be used to create interesting artistic compositions with objects and people through our approach the user changes the story of the photograph from two subjects standing next to a parked car to them watching the car fall off the cliff our geometry correction tool can also be used to create non-rigid edits of the object to see the stock 3d models used in this video please refer to the supplementary material thank you", "OKXWYlmJEUU": "[Music] [Music] ah why up it's dashie and welcome back yes back to what super mario maker 3d world ah what happened they're changing seasons

play this than now speaking of fitting this shirt i have to celebrate mario with this shirt but it is not fitting me it is it is quite you know undersized i've worn it like three maybe four times but the kids got the dope shirts you go to target walmart you see the kid's shirt they're like damn bro they got the best best shirts they got their shirts i wish i could buy more in [Music] no okay that's fine [Music] no okay i should stop let's do that job my boys [Music] dad stop you already did a freestyle in the last game play this is going do we just fight him what happens here is this like a okay no i'm not switching from the homie that's right okay what is going on here do we just is it just like a boss fight or i don't remember i don't quite remember this but i guess we're about to find out y'all doing good i hope so mario day is it that big um metal thing oh snap i remember that you fight this this thing like a couple times and it does get tough okay yeah yeah you climb on them oh boy oh boy and then you then you yeah okay got it that's what you got to do okay all right yeah y'all triple shifts go back down there all right here we go simple enough simple but i remember having a hard time later on though okay just climb on the snake oh they just go away like that okay can you can you climb on them or no that's the one that you got i missed my opportunity oh my god okay go they're giving you a lot of cat bells too guess what nah man let's go okay all right we got one more hit [Music] what kind of snacks okay come on give me another bell i know y'all got it what am i supposed to round round all right here we go this is your way up right here he's dead let's get it that's right give me my [ __ ] oh wait hold on grab all these shits we gotta get that tag [Applause] and the star don't leave without that can you imagine if i just left without the star i'd be pretty observed what okay there's only one star here right is there a stamp here or is it just is it just a star i think it's just a star i don't think there's a stamp here but you do have to get the top of the ships you know because we're trying to 100 there's no promises but we're gonna try my boys also it's so it's a little late for me to be yelling that i know my neighbors can hear that that was nice and simple i don't remember what world comes next thank you all right appreciate that anything down here no all right let's get it desert world is that what it is it is okay come on yeah yeah yeah hell no yeah whatever okay yeah all right let's let's get this popping stop let's go we got time for this let's find let's try to find as many stars as we can if not we're gonna have to double triple back let's go luigi okay we're not out here playing games today except for this one okay just walk with him walk with him okay now that i don't have the the kitty kitty meow meow it's gonna be tougher for me to find [ __ ] [Music] oh my god okay see i was gonna do that one jump that no stop that jump the trail jump that's what i was gonna do oh my i'm over it i'm already oh he's got [ __ ] to the top spikes here we go okay i see the stamp okay we might as well get that it looks like a simple stamp to get got it no star yet it's probably up there isn't it i died on purpose because i knew that that was gonna be there so now uh wait i don't have kitty kitty powers so how am i supposed to get up there now do they give oh they give you kitty kitty here just don't lose it all right here we go here we go kitty kitty meow go up here get this that is the first star good this looks simple enough just a simple [ __ ] like that and you get this perfect realm okay they got giant shits they need some sort of a pest control why am i not okay i see where the others start so you let the ant go and walk on that and you walk on the amp and then you get the shakes got it thank you okay can you just normal walk on them or do you have to bounce on them okay you gotta do a little bit of a bounce if i go through here can i come back oh that's what they're all right here they're saying less you could probably do it like this if you are broke like me you damn right you goddamn because i got the skills let's get it can i please get a kitty kitty wait how can i oh simple thank you appreciate that no don't risk that don't risk that just wait for it just wait for it there you go you got your [ __ ] now do small [ __ ] no you can do big i'm passing all over this [ __ ] face and i'm sorry about that okay block don't play with me do not dash slide to the right [Music] all right we got everything we could just bounce we good hey don't play with me right now wait something that glitched out y'all saw that hey i'm not questioning it only thing i'm gonna question is these [Music] hoes calm down i know that i know that if the cops come knocking what's this thing oh triple stamps no wait triple star single stamp here we go oh no i remember this [ __ ] oh man okay she is becoming a problem now um these these are with the grape sodas these are tough these are tough okay we gotta see what this is smoothly smooth [Music] you gotta be [ __ ] okay i lost my [ __ ] but that's where do i oh there okay i'm there all right at least get kitty kitty on me out so you can round around with them wow set your ass down there we go um there's gotta be something down there hundred percent here we go no cats don't like look at that okay is there something back there i feel like there is boom look at your boy man come on that's that stamp the stamps got to be back here i'm telling y'all i'm not playing but there could be something that i'm missing down there too so i don't want to okay [Music] i'll mess with watersheds we gotta check okay i didn't even have to come over here that's okay but you but you have to check you have to check either way so it's it is what it is all right get you that bell just like y'all need to be clicking that notification bell black okay that's fine all right no we're good i don't like this stop stop gotta find this oh this is where the last star is you gotta do some kind of maneuver where did i get a checkpoint where was the checkpoint at okay really that's fine god did it cause he's short low all right now i'm back okay that's what i wanted that's what i wanted anyway because with this i could go like that kill him like that and then i could kill him watch this don't get the star yet [ __ ] i told you not to get the [ __ ] yet i'm in trouble i'm in trouble yes don't fall trojan george is okay but don't [ __ ] luigi luigi luige i don't have a backup power no no [ __ ] up grip whip go just go [ __ ] you got everything you can bounce right we got everything yeah we got everything that's it wait how am i gonna make it to the top of the chicks big let's go dash calm your ass down cause you're gonna get the cops caught and i'm gonna be like well not to them because i don't you don't want to disrespect you oh just a pipe okay oh really all right i remember him i just don't remember how to defeat i think i remember a little bit but let's go in here and get some shapes is it the two gifts if so which one should i go for i went for the big one last time if i go for the small one ain't gonna be [ __ ] there [ __ ] here hit this [ __ ] it's that [ __ ] [ __ ] just get out of here okay i forgot how to defeat you is that all i gotta do [Music] simple damn would you gonna stand in there come on man your boy handled that your boy handled that [Music] oh he didn't have the i was waiting for the meow but he didn't have the [ __ ] um we gotta do that one on the left i already know what time it is with that so we're gonna hit this one up first because the one to the left okay oh [ __ ] i didn't mean to do it oh really oh come on oh come on oh no i hope this is not for astaro i don't like that i don't like that i don't like i almost got them shits have i really gotten zero stars [Music] that better be the first one cool it is okay cool okay let's go in it might be a star in here [Music] wow [Music] all right um i'm gonna go in here and try this again but i'm about to be mad okay so one of them is an actual spring [Music] i'm out of practice [Music] all right stop listen why the [ __ ] you age that's it i might come back with a kitty kitty suit that's what i'm gonna have to do because this is that [ __ ] [Music] this that [ __ ] that was that [ __ ] they designed it so this [ __ ] didn't make it only that kitty kitty [Music] wow i died on purpose just so i could do this again [Music] dash don't wait i miss astara where there's some mom to all the way to the top up there how nah [ __ ] wait that's not fair if you don't have kitty kitty you can't [Music] okay if you wait for it to come all the way down you can make that jump [Music] yes okay dash calm your ass down [ __ ] about to rip this okay all right bob there we go okay that's it that's it i can i can i can relax now do we have to stand we don't have the damn stuff [Music] wait they're going to stamp in the middle all them [ __ ] okay even if i got to take a hit we're going to get that stamp i came a long way from saying [ __ ] stamp to risking my [ __ ] for that we gonna go right to the middle of this and get that stamp regardless hey [ __ ] you bout to fall off this [ __ ] that's okay give me that give me that stain yeah you got this get the [ __ ] off [Music] you got to get the top of this [ __ ] no wait no we need the top of it okay um because i don't want to come back over here [ __ ] put that down [Music] let's go calm down dash don't scream it too loud i'm gonna get in trouble i'm gonna get in trouble what that's it is this like where you fight like five shits you get five oh my god how many i'm about to stress out this is going to be straight mystery dash what does that mean just for me oh no i don't like these okay let's just do that just go for it i feel like if you had kitty kitty meow this would

maybe there isn't a stamp yeah there's okay we gotta hit him with his sons oh my god that's right keep your back up justin you want his sons okay okay we're doing good don't use your kitty kitty power yet until you get 200 this shot was close hey bring your sons out stay in the room play nintendo since the vote hey get away from that [ __ ] so there really was no stamp in this or am i tripping maybe it's out here at the end [Music] okay should i get yeah let me use kitty kitty on me out just so i can at least get the um the top of the ships let me show there ain't nothing back here just in case okay yeah there we go there we go okay pose with me even though you ain't do [ __ ] and you got that hammer and you know damn well you could have broke that glass you acting nothing like that like a little oh stop sorry it's kind of cute though like a little peach [Music] look at all the stars my buddy come on man stop playing with me oh you had a wrench to break the glass okay not a hammer that definitely would have broke that glass but it's fine unless it's like not glass like is it acrylic [ __ ] i just saw something flat okay um well we missed the stamps here right let me look around how do you how did okay oh yeah we didn't miss a stamp okay so there's two things we got to come back here for maybe you know maybe we'll do a game play at when i beat the game to come back and get the stuff i missed whoa [Music] oh okay what kind of world is this look at this oh this looks nice i like this let me just explore a little bit then you go through here are you under water oh there's gonna be some other watersheds here isn't it okay boom i can just go in there now i got enough star wars okay all right my boys we're gonna end it right there we just we just out here murdering world and we're doing the best we can getting the stars and everything i'm gonna get a star of that like button what no my boys before i leave somebody wants to say hello oh what what's good mario oh hey what's up whoa how you what you was doing down there hey it's it's your day it's um march 12th i said it's march 10th so it's like it's mario day only because literally if okay but if you

something like this. It eventually started looking like a pretty impressive 2D film. But then the animators\nwent one step further to create a film that looked like this. Suddenly the characters\nlooked three-dimensional. But unlike most animated\nmovies these days, the characters in \"Klaus\" aren't CGI and can't even be considered 3D. It's all just a trick of the light. About 300 people, including 40 animators, worked on the movie \"Klaus,\" which took over two years to make. And it was completed under the wire, just one month before\nit premiered on Netflix. So, why did it take so many\npeople and so much time? To understand, we have to go back to 2010, long before \"Klaus\" was\nnominated for an Academy Award, to when director Sergio\nPablos came up with the idea. Because his story was about\nthe origin of Santa Claus, it appealed to nostalgia. And he thought a nostalgic,\n2D animation style like we saw in the '90s Disney films would be a better fit for the story. But he also wanted to advance the look, so his team at SPA Studios in Madrid added a few new crucial steps\nto the animation process. Sergio Pablos: I never looked\nat 3D as an evolution of 2D. I looked at it as a split, like there's a new way\nof making animation now. Narrator: First, they\nstoryboarded the script and made a cut using temporary\nvoices for the characters. They swapped these out later once the real cast was recorded. The next step was layout, where the team designed backgrounds and figured out the\nplacement of the cameras. Animating the characters\nand coloring the backgrounds happened simultaneously. The end goal was to have both\nblend together seamlessly and look like they're\npart of the same world. The characters were all hand\ndrawn using digital tablets and a program called Harmony by Toon Boom. The animators used\nlive-action reference videos of themselves as a guide. The initial sketches were very rough, as you can see here. But there was a cleanup stage in which artists refined the drawings with crisp, bold lines. Then they painted the characters\nwith basic flat colors. Here, everything still looks very 2D, but they will soon bring\nthe characters to life with a very important addition usually reserved for 3D animation: lighting. His team tested out a new method of lighting 2D characters and released a two-minute, 30-second-long proof-of-concept teaser back in 2015. The proof of concept looked good and secured them a deal with Netflix, but the process was too labor intensive. So they partnered with a French company called Les Films du Poisson Rouge to help advance the technology, which they called KLaS, short\nfor Klaus Light and Shadow. Poisson Rouge was able to make\nthe tool much more efficient and easier for the artists to work with. The KLaS tool allows the\nartists to paint with light using a number of\ndifferent types of lighting in various combinations, like \"key light\" and \"ambient light.\" With 3D CGI, light is added\nautomatically to objects, but it's trickier with 2D. Pablos: Well, with the\nlines, with drawings, the computer needs a certain level of AI to even understand that this\nline corresponds to this line and this hand is also this hand. Narrator: The software tracks\nmovement of the characters so the light and shadows\nwill move with it. The program takes a very educated guess, but it's not 100% accurate, so the artists can go in\nand fine-tune it by hand. Painting with light allowed the artists to get creative with details down to the tiniest\nreflections in their eyes, as you can see here. The team used lighting not\nonly to make the characters feel more real, but also to help tell the story. For example, when Jesper is\nhanding out papers to the kids like a drug dealer, he's always standing in the dark to illustrate his shady behavior. And when he's exposed at the\nend of the film by his father, he's the only one standing in the light, while the others are in the dark. Inspiration for detailed\nlighting techniques came from movies and TV shows, like using just a sliver of\nlight to illuminate a character similar to this scene in \"Apocalypse Now.\" And this scene, when\nJesper confronts the bully, was inspired by \"Breaking Bad.\" It's important that the backgrounds also look three-dimensional and follow the same lighting\npattern as the characters, so they used \"color keys\" as a guide. Pablos: They're quick doodles, you know, they don't have a lot of detail, but they tell you exactly\nwhat the light direction is and how it's gonna affect both\ncharacters and backgrounds. Narrator: For example,\nthis color keys shows how Jesper and Alva will be backlit by the sun coming through the window. And this one shows a\nprogression of how the light will change on Alva as\nshe steps towards Jesper. To make the backgrounds pop and appear 3D like the characters, the animators used several\ndifferent techniques, such as multiplanes, where you\nhave layers on top of layers to give the illusion of depth. The team created a total\nof 3,160 scenic layouts for the movie. After they'd merged the\ncharacters with the backgrounds, they used a second major step that really gave the 3D characters that intricate detail\nto bring them to life: texture. With another tracking tool, they used contour, lighting, and motion to add various effects to\nspecific parts of a character. Pablos: So now you could say, well, I don't want a lot of\nroughness on the skin, but I want the coat to feel rougher. Narrator: For example,\nthey can make them look like an oil painting or a watercolor. These textures are subtle, but if you look closely, you\ncan notice the difference. In the end, the characters\nlooked much more 3D and like a part of their environment, as opposed to looking like stickers on top of an elaborate painting. Pablos: And that's what throws people off when they say, \"This is 3D,\" because it's volume and it's\nmoving and it has texture. But it's really a combination of the light and the texture that makes that illusion. Narrator: The final stage\nis final composition, in which any last-minute\ndetails are added to the image, like particles. While the majority of the\nfilm followed the 2D process, the animators did use 3D models for some characters and objects and combined the two seamlessly. And even though these\nwere created using CGI, they were lit the same way\nas the 2D characters were: by hand. Pablos: There's things that\nbenefit from being drawn because they feel more organic, and there's, you know, things that are not\nsupposed to look organic. There's things that are\nsupposed to look solid, like wagons and doors and props, and it's really hard to\nmake it feel consistent and solid through drawing. Narrator: If you look\nclosely, Jesper's wagon is 3D, and so are some of the reindeer. Pablos: Whenever the\nreindeers had to do something, it was particularly challenging for 3D to look right with the 2D. We just animate the reindeers in 2D, and sometimes we would\nanimate one reindeer in 2D and the rest in the shot in 3D. Narrator: Scenes like this chase scene at the end of the film so seamlessly combine 2D and 3D elements that it can be difficult\nto tell which is which. Pablos: There was a shot where Jesper lifts a plate cover at one point, and I commented on how\ngood the integration of that 3D plate cover\nlooked with the 2D actor, and they said, \"Oh, no,\nno, that's actually 2D, we just painted it to look like metal.\"", "Mcy-lRNETAE": "[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah [Music] oops [Music] who yeah [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh i will find and kill you [Laughter] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] oh wow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] don't you dare touch mine [Music] [Music] wow a present for me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] no ah hahaha [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] this [Laughter] [Music] oh [Music] oh oh i will fight and kill you [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh no [Music] [Music] who is playing music [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] what will the ice cream maker want from [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] what the hell oh [Music] oh [Music] you", "Fuu_ZpXl5Uc": "[Music] [Music] hey oh what a pleasant day it is i mean who else could it be come on okay [Music] [Applause] oh no [Music] what the hell [Music] right oh [Music] oh no [Music] [Laughter] wow [Music] [Laughter] [Music] oh me [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] hello [Music] [Music] come on [Music] wow [Music] oh no [Music] oh it hurts [Music] i'm definitely the best chef in the [Music] world oh yes daddy [Music] uh [Music] oh so bad oh yeah [Music] oh no [Music] what the hell [Laughter] [Music] oh yes i mean who else could it be what the hell [Music] oh it hurts so bad what the hell oh oh no [Music] prepare to be amazed [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] what the hell [Music] oh [Music] [Laughter] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i mean who else could it be [Music] you by your tail you rap what the hell [Music] [Music] wow", "DuaB4lEyOdw": "[Music] you know i can't resist you [Music] okay [Applause] oh my god [Applause] [Music] oh my god [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh my gosh what the hell [Music] now [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] wow [Music] i mean who else could it be come on [Music] okay [Music] oh no come on okay oh yes [Music] here we go [Music] what the hell [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh what a pleasant day it is i mean who else could it be come on okay [Applause] oh no what the hell [Music] right [Music] huh [Music] what the hell oh no hmm no [Applause] [Music] oh yes daddy [Music] uh [Music] me oh yes [Music] prepare to be amazed [Music] i will hate you by your tail you rather oh no [Music] oh yes [Music] oh oh yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm i mean who else could it be [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah my hand my head [Music]", "A-OgTRVKfUk": "[Music] uh [Music] it up [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] oh [Music] [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh um [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] oh oh my god [Music] do that [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh foreign [Music] [Music] you", "Z94CP4BIpTo": "[Music] wow [Music] god open up your surprise [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] here we go i am fire oh my god oh damn [Music] here we go no no no no [Music] ugh [Music] hmm [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] like i said [Music] [Music] wow [Music] oh dab it scared the crap out of me oh no what is this green [Music] stuff [Music] do you have any idea how best i am [Music] well i'm what the governor of california called an enormously [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] girls [Music] let me out please [Applause] [Music] oh goody he's here [Music] [Music] stay out of my house did my credit card go i must get my card blocked at once [Music] oh no oh my god [Music] [Applause] bye-bye [Music] you", "HgPj6e3jtz0": "Holy crap, guys. We just had 33 3D printers\nfrom Prusa arrived, they're the i3 MK3S. And well, we were going to do a really big and really fun project with them but the world has\nchanged a lot since then. So let's get started,\nthere's a lot of work to do. There's a lot of work to do,\nthere's a lot of work to do. - Normally, our videos start\nwith an insanely big idea, and then we trim away the fat until we end up with a reasonable one. This was the exact opposite. Our original goal was to\nbuild about 100 face shields, donate them and then hand the\nreins over to our community. But at every step in this project, people have stepped up to donate\ntime, money, or materials, and we are now able to produce\naround 300 masks per day. We've got this massive local effort and by the time this video is over, we're gonna let you guys know how to help. That is obviously too big of a task for Alex and Colin to complete alone. Luckily, they don't have to,\nthanks to our sponsor, Ting. Why pay for things that\nyou don't need or even use? Ting wants to help you with\nthat with their phone plan since you only pay for what you use. Check it out at the link below to find out how much you can save. (upbeat music) This right here is what we plan on making, 3D printed face shields. So there's two parts\nthat need to be printed, the headband, got a\nbunch of headbands here, as well as the chin piece. Together, these hold a\nlaser cut piece of PETG that acts as the face shield. And then an elastic holds the whole thing in place on your face. So the purpose of this is pretty clear, somebody coughs or whatever and the face shield keeps\nthe incoming particles out of your eyes and nose. So the obvious question at this point is why are we not making\nmasks or respirators? - Oh, what do you think about my mustache? - That is Joseph Prusa, the guy that sent us 30 3D printers for a totally unrelated project. - There is a high\nprobability it will not sit and seal on your face. And unless it seals perfectly, it is maybe worse than simple cloth mask. - Prusa really kicked off the whole 3D printed\nface shield initiative, starting with a community design and then working with the\nCzech Ministry of Health on making sure that the\nmasks were validated. - I wanted to do it the proper way. So I contacted our government,\nthe Ministry of Health, and we started iterating with them. And everybody was quite\namazed that we had a meeting in the morning and a couple hours later, we bring a new version over. So that was pretty cool to see them for the first time\nexperienced the 3D printing. - Now as far as approval\nin the states goes. - It depends on what approval means. - That's Alan Puccinelli, the founder of Operation Shields Up!, a nonprofit in California that\nis coordinating the intake and production of 3D printed face shields. - Long story short, you\nknow, you can get approval for anything when a situation\nis dire enough (chuckling). I hate to say it like that, but this is battlefield\nmedicine right now, like, literally, they're\nshowing me these pictures of some guy made one out of a\ncafeteria tray and it's crazy. Where we are, it's so severe\nthat all of the regulations, like even in the state of California for the hospital being able to require that they have protective\nequipment has been lifted, because they can't guarantee\nthat it'll be there. - Alright, so now we've got the\ndesign and certainly a need, now we just have to build the 3D printers. - Well, I guess first thing,\nlet's get this unpacked. This is going to be one hell of a journey to get all of these done. I think that they said it's what, four hours to make each one? - That's pretty aggressive. But if you're skilled, I\nthink you could pull it off. - Alright, well, let's get to it. Assembly instructions, good God. I do really appreciate that. It's all colored instructions. So I don't have much concerns of this not going together well. - There's gummy bear.\n- Ooh. - Building, this printer\ntook me six hours. That's way too long for us to be able to get these\nprinters up and running. So what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna distribute these to makers in our local community. They're gonna build them,\nwe'll bring them back, sanitize them and we can get them running. - [Man] Off to the makers. From here on out,\neverything we do is sterile. Coming up on our first\ndelivery of the day. Hey bud? Should I come over there, I guess? Full on. Awesome. Hey? I bring you gifts. We're building a print farm\nto produce face shields. - I've heard rumblings about it. - [Man] Yes, this is the rumblings. Hey. Matt?\n- Yup. - I have a gift.\n- Amazing. I will, yup. Appreciate you from afar.\n- Thank you. - And I'll take care of this and put it together\nand get it back to you. Give you a call when it's done? - [Man] Yeah, give me a call. I'll come pick it up.\n- 'Kay, sounds good. - [Man] Sweet, enjoy! Leo? (knocks at door) - So it's pretty straightforward I guess? - [Man] Yeah, the\ninstructions are fantastic. - Alright, cool. Yeah I'll probably get it done by Monday. - [Man] Yeah, that's the\ndeal, that's the deal. - [Leo] Sweet looking forward to it. - [Man] There we are. - Gonna be a lot of fun actually. - [Man] Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah.\n- Thank you very kindly from a distance. - Yes, from a distance.\n- Cool, I'm on my way. - Alright. - Printers getting built is finding good but there's literally no\npoint in doing all of this, if we can't find a way to deliver them to the people that need them. - It's turned into, it's\nnot really a making problem, it's a logistics problem. I keep saying that to people. - It was during our conversation with Alan that it became clear that\nthis wasn't going to be just, you know, a fun time building\n3D printers and making stuff. At this point, we're pretty\nmuch project managers that somehow need to\ncoordinate a bunch of makers and get these things to someone. Now the original plan was to send them all to Operation Shields Up! in California, so that we could let them handle the sanitization and logistics. But since starting this project, various local groups have popped up, like BC COVID-19 3D Printing Group and Vancouver Makers for\nEmergency Response & Support. We'll be sending our first\nbatch of face shields to InkSmith in Ontario, though, as they seem to be about a week ahead in terms of sanitization and approval. Ah, awesome. So let's get printing. - [Man] Look at that,\nit's a completed printer. That's number two of 31.\n- You did the first one? - I did the first one.\n- Of course you did. - Yeah. - [Matt] Everything is\nall there, all the stuff. - [Man] Fantastic. - [Leo] Sweet. - [Man] Gonna go pick\nup 13 more. (chuckles) - Take care.\n- Thank you. Look at that, four printers. Oh, look at this operation\nyou got going on here. I've just unloaded all of the printers that we've got back today. Let's do a little count. So one, two, three, four, five. This one needs a little adjustment. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10 11 12, won't count because it\nneeds a little love, 13. These three need the extruders\ncompleted in the wiring, that'll bring us up to 18 printers. So it's happening, we're printing. - The most popular 3D printing\nmaterial is PLA, this stuff. It's great due to its\nlow melting temperature and really good print quality. But unfortunately, this also\nmeans it cannot stand up to the temperatures\nrequired for sterilization and is generally less chemical resistant. Instead, we're using PETG. Actually the same stuff used\nfor most plastic bottles, does not only kind of hold up to the temperatures of sterilization, but it's also much strongler, so less likelihood of\nit failing on the job. As a material, it does have some quirks. Like our first test, we tried to print with\nthe same method as PLA, and it actually welded\nitself to the build plate, destroying it on removal. We tried a couple different\nmethods to address this, but ultimately stuck\nwith using a thick layer of regular glue stick to\nact as a boundary layer. Since then, there's been minimal damage and removing the prints\nhas been super easy. - Our next logistical challenge\nended up being material. With a little bit of napkin math, we figured out that we would\nbe using around 800 grams of filament per day per printer, which if you didn't know is\na freaking lot of filament, that's about $400 worth\nof the stuff per day. Now to get us started,\nPrusa sent us 30 spools and Micro Center donated another 30, which was amazing and netted\nus about 600 face shields. But we were able to burn through all of that in a little over two days. What the long term future holds for our print farm is hard to say. But for now, the proceeds\nfrom the folding shirt over on lttstore.com is\ngoing towards someone to maintain it as well as\nmore filament as needed. So maybe consider grabbing one. Now then, let's address what loads of you have probably been yelling into\nthe screen this whole time. Why are we not just\nusing injection molding? Well, that process has\nalready been started by Operation Shields Up! and\nby other companies like Bauer, but until production has been ramped up, 3D printing is a great way\nto lessen the supply shortage and do it basically immediately. - I am amazed how quickly the desktop 3D printing community picks it up. And I mean, in just a couple of days, you could see it being printed everywhere. - With almost everything in place, the final hurdle then is sanitization, which, it turns out, isn't all that hard. - So actually, it's a really\neasy process like the CDC. We're using like a sodium hypochlorite, which is pool shock, it's pool chlorine. - For us, though, we're just letting InkSmith\nhandle sensitization since we don't have\nany approved facilities for it currently. - In the end, we didn't get\nall 30 printing simultaneously, but this 22 right here\nis nothing to scoff at. This right here is our\nmain bank of printers that are firming masks. And on the right over here, we\nhave some of that, you know, they didn't get fully assembled, but they've been really useful for parts. And then this guy on the end right here has been running test prints, while this one right here\nactually just failed. We're now producing\nabout 300 facial today, which isn't quite as many as we hoped for during the middle of the project, but way more than we ever could\nhave imagined at the start. Like look at this right here,\nthere's so many of them. And in each one of these\nboxes, there's 100. It's so sick. - This here is our bin of failed prints, which might look like a lot, but we have about 1000\nsuccessful prints now. And the smart features like filament run out\ndetection and crash detection and a whole host of other\nthings these printers do, make them ideal for print farm use. Well, there are some minor hiccups commissioning each of these printers, some had loose belts or\nother missed assembly steps, for the most part, it was pretty easy. Plug them in, let them calibrate and they're off to the races. - Obviously, we can't do\nall of this alone, though. So if you guys wanna help out, Prusa has a page of 3D printing groups. So you can try and find\na local group there. There are a lot of\nfacial designs out there, so make sure that the one that\nyou're creating from is one that is approved for use near you. And then guys, if there\naren't any groups locally, maybe it's time to make one. With so many people wanting to help out, about the worst that can happen\nis too many people step up. On that note, huge shout out to the people that helped us out. So Tinkerine, MG Chemicals,\nMaker Cube and MakerLabs, Laman Designs, Murray Wood\nCo., Prusa, Jordan Cook, Micro Center, shop.ca,\nOperation Shields Up!, and the dozen or so volunteers that all helped us to\nassemble these printers on literally zero notice.

count so now we start with one extra pencil dude this game now this game it doesn't remind me the lanky box posters but also reminds me when i was in school you know i would always try to have the coolest pencils but you know pencils crayons are expensive you know what i mean yeah i would always try to have the biggest collection you know people be trading colors and stuff i'd be i'd be trading you know i'd be maximizing my pencils you know what i mean yeah always uh i've talked about this before but have you guys ever had those colored pencils where there's two colors in the in one pencil oh it's like the tip is like half green and half red adam why are you flexing bro i've never heard of that in my life it's really cool it's like a multi-colored pencil it's like one pencil but you can like create multiple colors tell me you're rich without telling me you're rich i'm not i just always thought those were cool i never got them myself though why are you trying to flex adam trying to flex on us now i will say the the best pencils crayons i ever had were the box with the sharpener in the back the 64 count whoa this skin is sick it's like a galaxy pencil wow okay wait this is actually hey i might have to watch the ad and keep this this pencil's so cool oh it's a little teddy bear okay oh yeah i like this pencil wait this is so satisfying because the more pencils you get the bigger like the art like the the lines get when you're like going right oh we got a ton of pencils right here tap tap tap tap tap tap tap what do you think yeah i'm thinking maybe it's like a swimming pool it might be among us again honestly i don't know like an astronaut i don't know i don't know okay i'm gonna watch that i'm about to get this awesome skin right here bro i'm about to get that let's go okay nice here we go and we got the new skin whoa it looks awesome the galaxy pencil is so sick oh okay avoid the little teddy bear watch out for the vase this is so satisfying i also think this reminds me of one time i i remember like have you ever done that thing where you take like a bunch of crayons or colored pencils like you hold them in a bunch and you draw and it literally looks like this like it's a bunch of lines yeah i have done that that's funny you know what i mean yeah bro you already know uh foxy rocky and i'd be coloring just specialists okay yeah wait it's a dog it's a doge bro wow let's go okay i upgraded my pencil strength i don't really know what that does whoa look at this one the lanky blue crayon whoa it's glowing that is so sick wait dude i gotta collect all the glowing pencils i didn't realize you can have more than one equipped at the same time watch out whoa whoa whoa whoa the game is getting more difficult oh i should have kept the fire one from the beginning that would look so sick yeah maybe you can get it again though it's all good dude oh it says cool cool okay wow this game is cool yo we gotta get the lanky blue color as well wait that looks so sick nice now we got both colors whoa guys this is so satisfying i hope they give us another color another glowing pencil now i feel like i'm collecting pencils and crayons again which is what i used to do in school yeah you also haven't lost in this game so you're kind of becoming a pro like right away yeah wait wait how would you lose by losing all your pencils or like can't you like just fall off the edge oh yeah should i try that in the next round i'll try it i'll try it okay good idea we gotta finish the doge painting yeah the rainbow dawg it's so sick okay we still got some leftover crowns we can use them on this new one oh i see and then you can sell the paintings you make for money so like the dog one you got a hundred dollars oh okay got it got it all right i'm gonna upgrade my uh my count so we start with more pencils that's good yeah wait let me see if you can just go off the edge oh yeah you can then you lose okay okay okay okay oh all right here we go here we go here we go watch out um i wonder if the glowing pencils like paint better at the end i think so dude there's another glowing pencil up ahead i see it it's yellow one new one get it get it get it get it get it yeah yay wait this is so satisfying guys let us know if you guys ever collected like pencils or stuff in school i was collecting my collection was too big man that's why they banned me out of fourth grade that's why i had too nice of a collection the teachers were jealous that's what it was what do you think this painting's gonna be i have no idea bro i have no idea what that is it looks like a buffalo or something yeah or like a dragon maybe yeah something nice okay now now our pencil collection is lit we got the likey we got the lanky blue we got the foxy purple and we got the boxy yellow bro yeah it's looking real good oh we have a real nice collection right here bro i can't wait to see what the painting will look like and i can't wait to see what other glowing pencils will get in the future yeah i heard in this game like some of the paintings later in the game are really really crazy bro we're going to paint the mona lisa let's go let's go yeah it looks like a buffalo or something it's a cow oh it might be a cow dude i hope it is a cow so it could give adam some milk okay i'm gonna upgrade my paint level i'm not really sure what that does here we go maybe that allows you to paint more of the painting each time oh i think you're right dude i think you're right oh watch out for this oh this is tricky oh nice nice oh there's another glowing pencil it's like purple also oh cool there's another purple pencil okay is it new it's like a pink pencil yeah let's go let's go satisfying come on this is so satisfying look at that okay finish the cow please nice nice oh yeah it's a smiling cow okay we're not we're not quite done with this painting wait that painting is so funny okay nice oh oh that's sick let's get it okay dude i can't wait to see this cow when it's finished yeah then the next painting's gotta be crazier yeah this cow smiling reminds me of adam after he gets a nice glass of milk yeah or you when you get a milkshake yeah i do

let's go let's go you got it you got it i love yeah the way that like the pencils all follow you and they draw is so satisfying look at that man look at like look at the trail that they leave behind it's so pretty it's so colorful guys oh oh i said hi there oh it reminds me like a like a tie-dye shirt yeah oh have you ever made a tie-dye shirt adam i think i did when i was really little yeah i've never done that your mom doesn't trust me with that oh what does it say huh psy i don't know well i guess we'll find out yeah true let's keep going okay now i'm not seeing that they're giving us any more pencils and i really like collecting them so i hope they give us another rare pencil soon oh don't worry i know they will justin i'm sad that i lost i didn't get the first pencil the fire one we skipped that ad we should have watched it then i would have the whole collection yeah that's okay maybe you can get it like later in the video hopefully adam hopefully oh no oh whoa okay okay nice oh yeah what is this painting i wonder it's a little cat it looks like it looks like garfield a little bit i don't know what it is hmm side cat [Music] like instead of psychic it's side cat oh that makes sense that makes sense okay i'm level up my count because i feel like just starting with more pencils is always a good thing yeah good idea oh man look at how big our stack is already we barely just started this level oh i think it would be really cool if this game had like a bonus level where at the end you had to fight like an evil sharpener or something like that fight an evil eraser yeah that's a good idea yeah i like it yeah it's pretty good watch out watch out watch out oh nice nice nice we got a huge stack of pencils let's go let's go finish the psychic cat the side cat we got to be close okay nice nice nice are we almost done with the painting i think we still didn't finish it bro ah just a little bit more all right we'll get there we'll get there okay keep going keep going

complete our collection bro this is gonna complete our pencil collection all right and let's see who can guess the thing at the end first let's say you only get one guess so we can't just randomly guess one guess okay so you gotta use your guess wisely i i have no idea what it is right now so i'm not even guessing i don't either here we go guys can you guess this before us this is not my guess i'm just saying it looks like a block of cheese so far i was gonna say arthur okay okay whoever can guess first wins i have no idea i have no idea what i'm looking at it's something like in the desert i think but i don't want to make it again my guess is it's a it's an among us guy it's the orange among us guys those are his legs is that your guess that's my guess orange guy from among us let's go okay adam what's your guess um i i i gotta go with my gut i think it's arthur i don't know why you talking about boomer shows bro like like who like who'll be watching arthur bro it's either arthur or it's like a gingerbread man it's arthur and d.w bro maybe i think it's the orange guy from among us bro let's see who's right i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure or what is that is it okay maybe i'm not sure okay adam's locking in arthur the odd mark bro oh man it is still such a satisfying game i can't get over how nice i'm like hypnotized by the trail that the pencils leave yeah oh it's really pretty look at all the colors bro whoa and now you got your fire pencil that you wanted so badly oh i tried to get the pencils from the teddy bears hands but it oofed like most of the snack that was not worth oh you got tricked i got tricked by the teddy bear all right all right or you see like pikachu what is this bro it might just be an enemy from among us yo why should you never take a shower with a with a pokemon because he'll peek at you bro what is that ah it's like a little gremlin wait it's not it's not i don't think that's the among us guy but i mean i guess i was close now here's the moment of truth now i i don't really think i was right but i'm pretty sure it's not arthur the artist i mean guys leave a comment who you think gets closer just because i think you probably win i i will buy you some stuff from lankyboxshop.com nice thanks adam i'm real excited i'm gonna get all the new t-shirts the skipper to the chicken and the time to rock and roll t-shirt and

guys make sure to leave a like and subscribe go check out lankyboxshop.com get your own lanky box merch there we play with colored pencils we're gonna go eat some pretzels [Music]", "mrVNvXmoPJo": "hey guys thundee here it's been a while since i've done a battle vid and now this time we're checking out the xbox wireless headset versus the playstation 3d pulse to find out which is the best in that 99 price range so let's check them out all right thank you for watching this video guys and if you're watching for the very first time go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification icon so when it comes to gaming headsets they are dime a dozen out there but 99 is a price point that we all love right it's cheaper it's accessible now with these two headsets they're both priced at that price point and they have some really unique features so let's start off with the very first thing design build and comfort right so the xbox wireless headset is brand new from microsoft it's got some really cool features design wise it kind of mimics the xbox got that black and green color accents which is really nice it's got soft padding a bit snug on the ear cups themselves but they're quite comfortable it's got a boom mic to basically register your your voice more effectively according to microsoft and in terms of controls they're easy to access on each ear cup now when we look at the 3d pulse headset that's a little bit different it's kind of futuristic like the playstation itself kind of matching the console quite effectively now this connects via of course a usb dongle which you can connect to the back of your playstation via the usb ports design wise you've got something that feels uh a bit more softer and more plastically if you will it's still pretty comfortable to use the ear cups are nice and they rest easy comfort level i give the edge to the playstation 3d plus uh while in terms of just rigidity and build i give that edge to the xbox one aesthetic now let us talk about features now both of them have unique features to the headphones uh in terms of things like adobe atmos for the xbox wireless and you've got uh 3d sound for the sony headset but what about on device features now the sony headset has all this control on the left ear cup so things like volume game chat uh mixing you've got your mic monitoring in there you have got a headphone jack uh and you've got your power all on the left ear cup and they're all buttons so they can be finicky and hard to find so you're kind of searching for which one to select properly and it's kind of a guessing game as opposed to the xbox wireless headset that has this two cylindrical codes they kind of together from the surface headphones so the right ear cup you can rotate for your volume which is pretty nice and your left ear cup is your gaming chat mixing which is also pretty cool now things like mic monitoring is built into the software in your xbox so you simply access that directly so of course change your mic monitoring levels you also have an auto mute so when you stop talking it actually meets your mic you don't have to worry about hitting that mute button right there so in terms of features i gotta give that to the xbox wireless headset it's much easier to use and also really robust software features right there now let's talk about the microphone quality i do have the playstation headset with me first so let's check that out now with the audio quality in the playstation you're hearing a sample directly from the headset itself not my lapel mic giving you an idea of what this sounds like when you're chatting with friends while gaming on your playstation or even on your pc if say you're doing a video call video conferencing or gaming your pc as well this is a nice quick example now we'll check out the xbox wireless headset so this is how the microphone sounds off the xbox wireless headset not the lapel mic as mentioned earlier this will give you a clear example how it sounds in comparison to what sony is doing with the playstation 3d pulse and let's go ahead and move on to audio quality but i think both of them sound really good so when it comes to sound which is one of the most important things for a headset like this so headsets like this in general started off with the playstation 3d pulse the 3d pulse has really good sound signature really solid across the board uh especially for that price point things are clear they're crisp the 3d sound also is it's quite noticeable for positional stuff with games that actually apply to that well and i think it's got a really good sound signature overall uh although you can't mess with the eq so there's really nothing to do in terms of changing that now when it comes to the xbox wireless headset it's much bassier just off the bat it is a bassier sound but it's also really clean and clear i'm not a big fan of bassy sounds but it works really well for a lot of games especially when you're playing shooters this is absolutely amazing now i do like the fact as i mentioned earlier you do have the eq so you can go ahead and customize i was able to customize it to match what actually fits me best there so when it comes to the final analysis between both headsets which one is better than the other well in terms of sound quality mike you've heard it they both are very similar and i think at its price point you're going to get similar advantages from both headsets whether you're playing in the playstation or the xbox i give the xbox wireless the slight edge because it has the ability to connect to two devices at the same time so you can have yourself connected to your xbox and your smartphone uh so you can take in phone calls and watch content there while you're gaming and vice versa and i think that gives it the slight edge that allows you to use it for multiple devices as opposed to the playstation 3d pulse which you can connect to multiple devices but just one device at a time

entertainment", "KWZPJ-bkvEA": "hey everyone uncle jesse here i love resin 3d printing however there's no easy way to capture time lapses of your resin 3d prints that actually look good well that changes today i've partnered up with andrew sink who's well known for making some amazing fdm 3d printer add-ons and we've been working over the past few months on resin laps it's the simplest way for you to capture smooth seamless time lapses of your resin 3d prints we started this project with one basic goal which was to help anyone that has a camera with a shutter release to be able to take amazing time lapses of their resin 3d prints capturing your resin laps only requires three things a resin lapse cable camera that supports a trs shutter release and an sla resin 3d printer your resin laps can be set up in just a few quick and easy steps first take the photo sensor end of the resin laps and insert it into an opening of your resin 3d printer you want to make sure it has access to the light source so it can trigger photos to be taken next insert the other end of the resin lapse cable into your camera then it's just a matter of starting your next resin 3d print every time your printer processes a new layer it's going to capture a new image of your time lapse perfectly synchronized so that when you stitch all the images together it's going to create one buttery smooth time lapse it's that simple no programming no complications with wiring and soldering or any of that craziness we've taken care of all the complicated stuff for you and tried to make this as plug and play as possible and the best part is this should work with almost any sla resin 3d printer we're currently testing this with over 10 different resin 3d printing brands as well as over 20 different sla resin 3d printers we're planning on having guides on how you can get this set up on each of those individual machines and we'll be looking at additional support for other printers as our resin 3d printer collections grow our resin labs project is officially kicking off today and you can find links down below for more details on resin laps and where you can pick that up andrew and i can't wait to see what you all print with your resin laps and please make sure to tag us at resin laps with anything that you create and post online or use hashtag resinlaps hey thanks again for watching and i'll see you next time make sure to check out resin laps links down below [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "ZZD_nbS1_II": "[music playing] JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): There are human footprints on\nthe moon and rovers exploring the surface of Mars. We can Google a satellite\npicture of any place on the Earth's surface. So we often think\nthat our planet has been completely explored. But the depths of the\noceans remain a mystery. And the extreme depths\nhave barely been glimpsed. Down there is the last\ngreat frontier of our world. There are 12 trenches that\nare over four miles deep. They're thousands of miles\nlong and have a combined area greater than North America. That's a dark\ncontinent down there, waiting to be explored,\nunseen by human eyes because the machines don't\nexist to take us there. It's my dream to build such\na machine and get inside it, and dive to the deepest\nplaces in the world to explore them with my own eyes. [music playing] [rustling] I started preparing\nfor these dives when I was a kid, getting\nin a cardboard box. Close the lid, and imagine\nit was a submarine.  Ooh.  Drawing with a Crayon,\nyou know, some gauges. Fuel, Depth. I was a real science\ngeek, you know. But for me, it was all about\ntrying to understand the world. Understand the limits\nof possibility.  Hey, little buddy. JAMES CAMERON: I think\nit was from being a kid in the '60s, when we\nwere doing so much exploration. From going to the\nmoon and Jacques Cousteau is\nexploring the oceans. And, you know, I\njust love that stuff. I couldn't think\nof anything cooler than to be a deep\nocean explorer. I can remember the first\ntime that the deep ocean captured my imagination. It was, you know, when\nTrieste went to the bottom of the Challenger Deep. NARRATOR (ON TV):\nThe Bathyscaphe would pass its own test in\n1960, its third model carrying Piccard's son\nJacques and Don Walsh 35,000 feet down into\nthe Mariana Trench. JAMES CAMERON: The Bathyscaphe\nTrieste was an amazing machine for its time. A massive 150 ton\nsteel balloon filled with gasoline for flotation. It had a 14 ton pressure sphere\nfor the crew slung underneath.  Oxygen one thin bar. Scrubber fans on. Damn it. Tachometer's taken a hit.  We'll go without it. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nInsider the sphere, US Navy lieutenant Don Walsh and\nscientist Jacques Piccard would pilot Trieste to the\nbottom of Challenger Deep. It was a dive into history. But no one has been back since. Just like on Trieste,\nthe heart of our new sub is a steel sphere\nforged in fire. 52 years later, there's\nstill no better solution. The sphere is nature's perfect\nshape for resisting pressure. And that's going to protect\nme from the crushing force down at the bottom, over\n16,000 pounds per square inch. That's like having two Humvees\nstacked on your thumbnail. It's taken us three years to\ndesign and build this sphere. We have to heat-treat\nthe steel to be strong enough to withstand\nthe weight of seven vertical miles of water. We have to know that\nthe sphere is safe. If it buckles on\na real dive, it'll implode at hypersonic speed, and\nI get chummed into a meat cloud in about two microseconds.  The clanks I heard\nwhen I tested it the first time, when we\ngot rid of the stress cracking, that hasn't happened. It's 16,000 PSI. Looks like we've done it.  You got to be happy with that. We're all the way to the top.  So it's as you predicted.  So it's as I predicted.  Well done. Good on you, Ron.  When you design technology\nto do something new, it's going to look strange. Deepsea Challenger is\na vertical torpedo. It's designed to scream\ndown through the water column at high speed. The reason for that is we'd\njust rather spend the time at the bottom working\nand exploring than going through seven miles of water. There are certain\nfish that actually will hover over the reef\nin a vertical position. So nature provided an\nexample of the fact that it's not crazy to\nthink that a submersible can move through the water\nin an upright position. Deepsea Challenger is not\na stunt vehicle to just go down and set a depth record. It's designed from the ground\nup as a science platform. There's a hydraulic manipulator\narm for taking samples. A sample tray in\nthe science door. There are push cores\nfor taking sediment. A payload bay for instruments. And two 3D cameras, one on\nthe boom and one on the arm. Every single thing\non this vehicle has to be built from\nscratch to withstand the crushing pressure. It's just this kind of\nragtag group working in a little, tiny shop next\nto a plumbing supply place on that side, and a plywood\nsupply place on that side. You know, nobody even knows\nwhat we're doing in here. And one of the most amazing\nthings about this vehicle is that it shrinks\nover two inches during the dive from pressure. That's enough to shear\naircraft-grade bolts.  It's still got to\ngo in quite a way. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nSo the sphere is actually held onto the sub by straps. But we're also fighting the\npressure of time our expedition ship just arrived, and\nwe're supposed to leave in less than three weeks. But we don't have a sub. It's still in pieces\nall over the shop  How big a problem is it?  I need to know when\nwe're going to be seeing some action on\nthat sub, so we can start doing some integration. If you're saying 3rd\nof January, we're going to have it wired out. We're still weeks away from\ngetting integration done. JAMES CAMERON: We have to\nhave an integration schedule. I want that schedule put up on\nthe wall right over there, OK? Who's going to have their stuff\nplugged in, ready to test, when. And everybody is going\nto be individually accountable for their\nstuff to that schedule. I've got a ship\nsitting at the pier down there with nothing to do. Right now, it's just on the\nclock, like a taxi meter. A taxi meter at $35,000 a day.  Jim's management\nstyle is often to put people under pressure,\nand then get results from that. And that can work really well. But when you're\nin an R&D project, sometimes, things just-- things just aren't\ngoing to work.  We've got some mechanical\nproblems here that we'll solve over the next couple of weeks. Hopefully before Christmas\nEve if we can do it. If not, it'll be Boxing Day. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWe're not going to compromise. You don't compromise. Not on the stuff\nthat keeps you alive. WALT CONTI: The most important\nthing is the weight system. Basically, you strap\na bunch of weight on the sub at the surface. And then you let go, and\nthe thing sinks like a rock. So literally, if the\nweights don't come off, the sub doesn't come up. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): So\nwhen you've got a system that's survival-critical,\nthe only way to be confident is to test it over\nand over and over and over.  When you dive to the\nbottom of the ocean, you have to face the fact\nthat there are hundreds of horrible ways to die. In the unlikely\nevent that there is a break in any of\nthe seals in even the penetrator or the hatch-- Closing hatch. JOHN GARVIN: --the\nwater will bust through, with the\nstrength of which you could cut a man in half. There's the risk of fire. It's Jim's personal nightmare.  Go! Drill! Fire, fire, fire. Forward cabin. [alarm buzzing]  OK. I'm on mask comms.  Additional life support. Shut down the oxygen.  Copy that. Now, vision one. What about vision two?  Bail out rebreather. Isolate the oxygen. Shut it off.  All right.  And consider drop weights.  Right. Drop weights. Weights coming off.  And done. That's 25 seconds.  Eh, 25 seconds. Eh, OK. I give myself a 50-50\nchance of survival on that. JOHN GARVIN: The biggest\ndanger is probably CO2, the waste product from breath. And if that's not\ncleaned and scrubbed, the pilot will be\nstruggling to breathe, and will eventually\npass out and die. [siren beeping]  Jim, you OK? JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): I think that there is a certain\nkind of healthy paranoia that goes into the engineering\nof a vehicle like this. You funnel that anxiety\ninto the engineering solutions that make it safe.  Done.  That's good. JAMES CAMERON: What I don't\nlike personally focusing on is, you know, what if somebody had\nto call Susie and tell her?  I hear all the risks,\nbecause he tells me. And then he tells\nme all of the things that he's created so\nthat it will be safe.  And dome.  Got it.  All right. Then let's say that\ndome cue three times.  Action. [screaming]  Dome, dome, dome. [screaming] SUZY AMIS CAMERON: I've watched\nhim do it now for 16 years. Whether it's with our\nchildren or on a film set or on an expedition,\nhe sets his bar so high with safety,\nwith creativity, with everything he does.  Cut.  Wow.  The whole upper section has\nall been on and come back off. Remember, I told you everything\ngoes on and comes back off? - Yeah.\n- See this right here?  Yes. JAMES CAMERON: You've\ngot to think a lot about what your priorities are. You know, I mean,\nI'm a family man. I've got five kids. A lot of people would set\ntheir priorities as those are the ultimate priority. And they are to me. Ready to come out? But I think part of what\nyou give your kids is more than just your presence. It's your example. All right. Now we've got our youngest-- our youngest deep\nocean explorer. She's already taken\nher pink Uggs off.  Hey, I'm going to-- JAMES CAMERON: You\nwant to go for a dive? Do you want to go underwater?\nNo? JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nIf you live in fear and you never\nfollow your dreams, you've compromised in\na much greater way. I was in love with the\nocean before we ever met. It was watching all those great\nunderwater explorers on TV in the '60s that got me excited\nabout this alien world that was right here on Earth, that was\nas rich and exotic as anything that I could imagine myself. For me, diving,\nthat's my calm place. I feel privileged to\nget to bear witness to the imaginative\npower of evolution that's created all these\nunbelievable forms of life.  Man, I just-- I'm inspired by that. Test, test, test. One, two, three, four. First recorded\ndialogue underwater on film for a theatrical\nmotion picture in the history of the world. OK, and action. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): When\nI chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking. And of course, the stories\nthat I chose to tell were science fiction stories.  I need you to be\ncloser to the camera. I need to have the shot\ncut right about here. It's a closeup, OK? JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): So I make a movie called \"The Abyss.\" At the core of it is\nthis idea of going deeper and seeing what's down there. And in it, are all these, at the\ntime, cutting-edge new pieces of technology, like ROVs, like\na robot that can fly underwater. What a great concept. And so, at that point I\nthink for the first time, I stepped over a line\nfrom science fiction into a reality that involved\nthese kind of science fictional concepts, of robotics\nand deep exploration and so on. And that's when I decided to\ndo \"Titanic,\" because I knew that in the making of that\nfilm, I would get to dive to the Titanic for real. That was the first time\nI ever went really deep. Like kind of deep that I\nused to imagine as a kid, pitch black, going\nto another world. I was struck by how surreal\nit was to actually be there at the wreck of this famous ship\nthat had seemed like a legend to me all my life. And it wasn't a legend anymore. It was a real place\nwhere real people died, where this great\ntragedy had taken place. And something about looking\nout at that rusty deck, knowing that that's right where\nFirst Officer Murdoch loaded the lifeboats or where the\nship's band played, just had this huge effect on me. I really got bitten by the\nbug of deep ocean exploration. It was adventure.\nIt was curiosity. And it was an experience that\nHollywood couldn't give me.  Whoa! [music playing] [cheering and applause] So after \"Titanic,\"\nI said, you know, I'm just going to park my day\njob as a Hollywood movie maker. And I'm going to go be\na full-time explorer. JAMES CAMERON: OK, Jake's out. Trim is good. Man, this is so much\nlike flying a helicopter. Feels like a pretty\nstable hover. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nIf I was going to go back to Titanic,\nI wanted to explore the wreck like never before. On the inside. So we built this little bot--  Pretty cool. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): --that was designed to be\njust a little bit smaller than a B-deck window. JAMES CAMERON: OK, I'm going in.  Don't do it. Don't do it. You'll be laying your tether\nright across the glass. JAMES CAMERON: I'm in. That's what I'm talking about. Look at that. Unbelievable. Those are the leaded windows. Look at that. Oh my God. Look at the preservation\non that wood. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThat second Titanic expedition brought\ntogether a core team that's lasted over a decade. Andrew White has run all\nour expeditions since 2001, and Ron Allum is the genius\ntech guru who's built the gear. Our next target would\ntake us even deeper, the battleship Bismarck. The infamous German\nbattleship was sunk in one of the most furious\nNaval battles of World War II. Now it lies in\n16,000 feet of water. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE\nON RADIO: Yeah, copy. We are heading aft over the\nstarboard secondary turrets, over JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThe guns are silent now, but seem ever on guard. It's a grim place,\nthe whole ship somehow preserved in the underworld as a\nmonument to the madness of war. JAMES CAMERON: We are\nright over the swastika. Over. OK, Elwood's out. I'm on the move. OK, that could be a way in. You see that shell\nhole right there? I'm going to try to\ngo in this hull, OK? This is going to be tight. OK, just inside this door\nshould be the adjutant's office. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWe were able to identify a few specific rooms. But mostly, we just\nfound total destruction. The armor-piercing shells\njust tore the interior apart. JAMES CAMERON: Jeez,\nthis is devastated. OK, there's the\nstarboard propeller. So the hit from the torpedo\nshould be right above us. That is for sure a hole\nright above the rudder. OK, so that's our torpedo hole. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nOur forensic work got the attention of the\ndeep exploration community. And we started to\ngain some credibility. And all these institutional\nguys in academia, that have this\nvery sophisticated oceanographic\nequipment, are kind of looking over at our stuff,\nsaying, they have that? We don't even have that. The question is, am\nI a filmmaker who does exploration on the side? Or am I an explorer who\ndoes filming on the side? SUZY AMIS CAMERON:\nWhen he decided ultimately to do\n\"Avatar,\" he was really debating back and forth. Was he going to quit directing\nas a Hollywood director and just go do expeditions,\nwhich was something he-- he loves it. He lives it. He breathes it. I mean, he loves\nmaking films, too. But there's something\nabout Jim and the sea.  Look at this thing. It's incredible. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nMy problem is I'm curious. I'm a curious monkey, and I need\nto go see for myself, you know. I've seen some\npretty astonishing things in the depths. Things that fill your\nsoul with wonder. What always gets me\nis how life adapts. It can adapt to the\ncrushing pressure. It can adapt to the\nabsolute darkness. It can feed off\njets of water that are hot enough to melt lead. But the question is, can life\nadapt to the ultimate pressure 36,000 feet down? Maybe the only way to know is to\ngo down there and take a look. WALT CONTI: We first met Jim\non \"The Abyss\" 25 years ago. He was maniacally\nfocused and driven. And now, I think he actually\nenjoys inspiring the group. He's trying to reach this state\nof perfection and achievement. And he wants everyone to\nkind of rise to that level. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nPushing people, it's not about yelling at them. It's about creating goals\nthat are achievable, whether they think\nthey're achievable or not.  Yeah, the only\nreason we're filling it is so we can\npressure test things, because we need to start this\npressure qualification process. We've never controlled\na J-box from the pack. But the J-box is--  Why not?  Because we haven't had--\nwe haven't got to that stage of the integration yet. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nEvery single time you've gone up a tier\nin the architecture, you've had to pull everything\napart and solder resistors. And what makes you think it's\ngoing to be any different now?  I designed the J-boxes. [laughter]  Oh, you just stuck\nyour neck out so far.  This isn't an option for him. He has to do it. It's such an internal\ndrive for him. That once he started that\ntrain, it's not going to stop.  We're coming to\nthat funnel where--  Everything needs\nto be done at once.  We've got five people who\nwant in the sphere at one time. But only one person\ncan work in it. Five people want the\nlower pod at one time, but there's only one\nperson can work in it. We're not project\nplanning no more. What we're doing is\nwe're fire-fighting. They're all tired, and they're\nall working 16-hour days.  To say that our team is not\nready yet to go out to sea is an understatement. We're so far from ready\nit's not even funny. Our biggest enemy at\nthe moment is time. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): Well,\nwe obviously underestimated the systems integration. So the new deadline\nis February 6. Come hell or high water,\nthat's why we're sailing. Nobody outside the project\nhas seen Deepsea challenger. And the first to\ndo so is Don Walsh, the only living\nperson who's been to the world's deepest spot. And by crazy coincidence, he's\narriving on the anniversary of his famous dive.  This is a Kawasaki\nracing dream. These are racing colors, baby.  You had seen\nconceptual drawings. You had an idea, and you\nknew it was underway. What is your reaction to this?  Oh, I'm very excited. I mean, what took you so long? 52 years.\nI mean-- [laughter]  To the day.  To the day.\nYeah.  So, Don, do you\nhave any tips for Jim, at about 20,000 feet,\nif he hears a crack?  If you can hear it, you're\nstill alive, and might as well keep on with the dive.  You never hear the\none that gets you. DON WALSH: Jacques\nPiccard and myself made a dive to the deepest\nplace in the world oceans. The motivation was to\ntest out a platform, and not to do science. That would come later. And what better test than the\nultimate depth in the ocean?  Passing 3,800 fathoms. Coming up on 5,000 fathoms. [loud bang]  What the hell was that?  We are still descending. Turn everything off. DON WALSH: At 30,000 feet,\nthere was this huge bang. And we didn't know what it was. I looked through the window\nin the entrance hatch.  Better come take\na look at this. DON WALSH: And I\ncould see this crack across that large\nacrylic window.  In my opinion, is this\nis not a serious problem. There's no reason to ascend.  Agreed.  Mhm.  Mhm.  OK. DON WALSH: So if,\nin fact, there had been a pressure\nboundary failure, we would have been\ndead before we knew it. There were no\nindications of problems. So we decided to\ncontinue on down. OK I can see the bottom now. Coming up slowly. There it is. Looks like we found it, Jacques. After we landed, we stirred\nup a big cloud of sediment. And It was just like\nsomebody had painted the front of the window white. It was like looking\ninto a bowl of milk.  C'est la vie. DON WALSH: And after about\n20 minutes we realized, it was going to\ngo away very soon. So we had five hours,\n15 minutes down. 20 minutes on the bottom. And about three\nhours coming back up.  And the purpose of this\nis to signal the fact that we're transitioning\nfrom building a sub to operating a sub. So Andrew Wight came up with\na crazy, potentially brilliant idea That since we're heading\nto Guam to dive the Challenger Deep, we're going to be going\nright through Papua New Guinea. There happens to be a spot. They call it Jacquinot Bay. This is a perfect place\nto sea trial the sub.  The thing that you've all\ngot to start to realize now is that you're going\nto have no support. Other than the people\nthat are around you, you just got to now get\ninto a different mindset. So whoever you bunking\nwith, be good friends, because you're going to\nbe with them for a while. If you snore, well, too bad. [laughter]  Everybody here is here\nbecause you're good. Because you're good\nat what you do. And you've proven\nyourselves to the project. And we're going to go out and do\nsomething truly extraordinary. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThere's always a ramp-up right before the expedition leaves. There's an\nacceleration of energy, and a lot of last-minute\nproblems as everything's coming together. You're running a race, and you\njust have that burst of energy that comes from somewhere. And you just push hard. [applause]  I think we've got everybody. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThere are a lot of very worthy goals on this project. But one of them is just\nthe fun of the challenge. It's the fun of being able to\nsay, look what a little group of people, no adult\nsupervision, can do if they put their minds to it.  Who wants to dive a sub today?  Er.  Er. Exactly. All right. See you in the sunshine.  Godspeed below. And hold. Final checks. Lower away.  Looking good.  Starboard. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): When\nthe hatch gets bolted shut, there's a moment where\nyou're suddenly in a very quiet, very finite world. It's like being in\na space capsule. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: OK, Challenger. Stand by to get wet.  Yeah.\nRoger that. Ready. JAMES CAMERON: Hatch is secure. No leaks. Please make a note to the\ncamera pan tilt, the pan, is wired backwards.  Copy JAMES CAMERON: I'm not getting\na reading on the altimeter at all. Should I be?  You should be. We're looking into it.  OK, the camera boom\nis also wired backwards. JOHN GARVIN: Your sonar\nhead is upside down. Therefore, it will relay the\ninformation back to front.  OK. All right. That explains that. So pretty much everything\nthat can be wired backwards is wired backwards. Be advised, temperature\nis 100 degrees. 100 degrees. We're not having\na good time here. OK, I think it's time\nto descend 1 meter. Over. [cheering]  SO, do you copy? Over. [static on radio] JAMES CAMERON: We can\ngo ahead and terminate this test dive, because\nthe ACOMMS while submerged are not acceptable. Over. [cheering]  That's the big dive. One meter. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): OK,\nso the test in Sydney Harbour showed us exactly\nhow ready we're not.  Because we're\ncompensating safety.  Well, the compass works. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): But you've gotta get out of the harbor and\ntest the sub in deeper water. [chatter] JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): This dive will also provide Mike\nwith our first opportunity to film Deep Sea\nChallenger underwater.  Have fun.  Thanks. I mean, it will be fun\nif everything works, or even if 50% of it works.  Exactly.  All right. We'll see you on the bottom.  All right. JOHN GARVIN: OK. Trial dive ready to release.  Stand by to initiate descent. Release, release, release. JOHN GARVIN: Away. See you later, buddy. JAMES CAMERON: Surface,\nsurface, Deepsea Challenger. Do you copy? Over. JOHN GARVIN: Copy that. Deepsea Challenger. ACOMM signal is coming\nthrough strong and clear.  Copy, surface. I am approaching the bottom. Dropping shot to slow descent. You have 200 units\nand downthrusting. Just easing down. Touchdown. Surface I am on the bottom. Depth, 62 feet. Over.  Super, super successful dive. Everything worked.  Yeah, you guys have pulled\noff a pretty amazing feat. To have second dive\nin an open ocean, and for pretty much\neverything to work in the history of manned\nsubmersible operations, is pretty much unheard of. Well done. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nI'm proud of the team. They really came through. We're ready to sail.  Hollywood director\nJames Cameron has paid tribute to an\nAustralian filmmaker and his American colleague,\nwho were killed in a helicopter crash south of Sydney. REPORTER (ON TV): Andrew was\nflying his own helicopter with American\nfilmmaker Mike deGruy when it crashed just after\ntakeoff on this tiny airstrip at Jaspers Brush. JOHN GARVIN: I found out\nabout Andrew's accident. You know, I was busy\norganizing things. I remember Jim walking\nstraight across the deck to me. And he looked to me and he\nsays, the dive's aborted. I'll never forget\nthe look on his face. He went white as a sheet. And then he said, we've\nlost Mike and Andrew. JAMES CAMERON: Immediately\nafter the accident, I was just so sick\nat heart in general that I just-- it just felt wrong\nto even be trying to continue. SUZY AMIS CAMERON:\nThere was just such a devastation in his voice. And I had never seen\nhim ever in that way. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nAndrew and Mike were like family to me. They were my deep sea\nbrothers, and true explorers  I tell you, it\njust went chomp. I was literally inside\nthe jaws of a shark. Can't get any closer. It was incredible.  And there's just this\nbig rip across the fabric of reality for these families,\nyou think, is this worth it? Maybe just risks\nshouldn't be taken. Maybe the consequences\nto our families are-- are too great  I think the one thing I've\nlearned from all of this is, don't leave things to\ndeal with later, you know? You love people and you want\nto spend time with them, then do it. Don't put it off till\nlater, because it's-- it just goes in a heartbeat. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nOver the next, I want to say, 24 to 48 hours,\nthere just seemed to be this sense that the way\nto give the situation meaning was not to walk away and have\nit have been for nothing. Just how do we do it? How do we muster\nup the strength? How do we put the\npieces back together? We set up a war room,\nand we got real serious. And the funny thing was\nthat everybody stepped up. I hate it when people say it's\nwhat they would have wanted. But frankly, they'd both kick\nmy ass if we wimped out now. It's the right\nthing to do, to give purpose and meaning to\nwhat Andrew and Mike stood for as explorers. So we're on our way\nto Papua New Guinea, to the New Britain\nTrench, where we're going to do our test dives. Going progressively\ndeeper and deeper. [chanting and rhythmic music] This place is everything\nAndrew promised. Calm, deep water right offshore,\nsheltered by the island. These are perfect\ndiving conditions. The shadow of the accident\nis still hanging over us. There's this sense of\ndread, and a feeling that we're just not ready.  Let's dive. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nAnd that's exactly when you've got to push through. Right now, these\nguys need a win. We need to get a deep\ndive under our belts. And then maybe we can face going\nall the way to Challenge Deep.  See you in the sunshine.  Coming up. OK, it's on you, Steve. Nice and slow. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nSometimes you have to push and you have to make that dive. Even if you think\nyou're not ready. [chatter on radio] JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThat gives people a sense of accomplishment. They'll come back and\nsay, we did it guys. You know? Look what we did.  OK, stand by for\nthe transition, guys. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWhether we achieve our ultimate goal\nor not, I think we've all learned an incredible\namount about each other and how you work\ntogether as a team.  And here we go.  Keep it coming, Donny. Keep it coming. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON RADIO:\nUh, Deepsea Challenger, standby to rotate to dive position.  Yeah, copy that. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON RADIO:\nOne minute to target area. JAMES CAMERON: Copy. JOHN GARVIN: Uh,\nDeepsea Challenger, you're on target now. On target now. JAMES CAMERON: Wait, one. I just got to do\nthe final check. OK, final check. Vision one, 18% O2. CO2 is 0.3%. Scrubber fan is running. Toward B bus, lowest bus\nat 87%, looking good. Depth gauge is working. Compass is working. Now, wait, one. OK, ready for descent. Are you ready? JOHN GARVIN: Yeah,\nDeepsea Challenger, whenever you're ready,\nwe'll initiate and launch. JAMES CAMERON: OK, here we go. And release, release, release. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: Deepsea Challenger, you're now released.\nSave travels. JAMES CAMERON: See you. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nI think my heart rate's up a little bit at\nthe moment that I tell them to release the sub. I start to drop. But right away, there's so\nmany things to do, establishing communications and all that.  Surface, Deepsea Challenger. Do you copy? Over. JOHN GARVIN: Deepsea\nChallenger, ACOMMS Mermaid. How do you copy? Over.  Copy you, John,\nloud and clear. You have a good comms voice.  Copy that. The skipper says it's like\nI'm talking to my grandma.  Do you want a biscuit? [laughter] JAMES CAMERON: Surface,\nDeepsea Challenger. I'm at 2- 8- 7- 3- feet. Vertical speed 1.4 knots. OK, drop some shot. 0.6 knots. OK, definitely slowing down. Should be seeing\nsomething pretty soon. Aha. That's it. Definitely on bottom. Cool terrain coming up here. Slowing. Contact. Surface, Deepsea Challenger. I am on the bottom. Depth 3- 0- 7- 4- feet. Over.  Deepsea Challenger. Copy that. You are on the bottom. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON RADIO:\nRange of lander is 250 meters. JAMES CAMERON: Yeah, hang on. I'm just learning how to fly\nthis thing over the bottom. I have good control\nof the vehicle. And I seem to be\nin a stable hover. Back around south. Oh, great. Big holothuroidea. Wow, he's gorgeous. Nice, nice. Whoa, he's attacking me. Whoa. Oh, he's not digging that. Sorry about the\nthrusters, buddy. That is a big sea cucumber. He has no idea how\nbeautiful he is. What the heck are you? Oh. yeah, polycheate. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): Basically, I get so carried away\nshooting the critters, I forget I've got work to do. I need to get good with\nthe manipulator arm. We're not just out\nhere doing test dives. We're doing science, too,\nas we're going along. So I've got to get\nsome rock samples. Otherwise, the\nscience team aren't going to be happy campers.  Got ya. All right. My first sample. I'm proud of it. I am at the lander. Over. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nAnd we also built a lander. It's this unmanned science\nvehicle that basically just free-falls to the bottom. It's got lights and\nhigh-resolution cameras. And it can take water\nsamples and so on. It's even got this arm that\ndrops down with a baited trap, so it can attract all the bottom\nforagers from miles around. JAMES CAMERON:\nLander is released. On ascent. Over. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nI think of human knowledge as being our\nheadlights, and they're shining out into the darkness. And right beyond those\nlights is something else. And all we have to do is move\nforward a little bit more, and that truth will be revealed,\nor that new discovery will be revealed.  Deepsea Challenger,\nconfirm request to ascend.  Copy. Weights coming off. Here we go. Vehicle is very\nstable at 5.6 knots. [cheering] JOHN GARVIN: Deepsea\nChallenger, surface contact.  Copy you, SO. We're here. JOHN GARVIN: All right\nSo good to see you back. We'll get you recovered\nand get you under way and get you on board. JAMES CAMERON: Copy that.  OK. Steady! Goldy, take the line in. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): 3,300 feet. It's like 1/10 of\nwhere we're going. But you know what? Right now, it's the victory\nthis team really needed. The curse of fear has\nofficially been lifted. We're going to dive. The New Britain Trench again. But I want to see\nthis town of Rabaul that's only a few miles away. Or see what's left of it. In 1994, this town\nof 17,000 people was utterly destroyed\nby a volcanic eruption. An eruption caused\nby the same forces that formed the trench itself.  This is where my house used to\nbe and a couple of houses here.  Was this all like\na neighborhood? Were there are a lot of houses?  Yeah, quite lot of houses. What it did was just, like, kind\nof black smoke kind of thing. And when it did that,\nit was all black.  Right.  We couldn't see. I had to touch you--\n- Yeah - --to know that you're there.\n- Amazing.  Yeah.  We were diving just\non the south side of New Britain Island.\n- Right.  And we go on out about\n30 miles off shore. And we can go down five\nmiles in the trench, in the New Britain Trench.\nFRANCIS KETA: Yeah, OK. JAMES CAMERON: See,\nthese deep trenches are formed when one plate\nof the Earth's crust is dragged underneath\nanother plate, right? FRANCIS KETA: Yeah. JAMES CAMERON: They\ncall it subduction. FRANCIS KETA: Yeah. JAMES CAMERON: And it's because\nthe continents are all moving around like these big rafts. The rock of the sea\nfloor is grinding down underneath, right? Under these billions of\ntons of rock overhead And it melts, and\nthe pressure just builds and builds, until all\nthis magma is pushed upward. And boom. So we came here\nand we saw, wow-- look at what these forces that\nare happening way down, so many miles down in the Earth. Look what they're doing here. And look at the consequence\nto human beings.  Right. We belong here. So the best thing to do is\njust to n and get on with life, I suppose. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThe same subduction forces that caused the\nRabaul eruptions also unleash undersea earthquakes. When that fault slips in\none of these deep trenches, it displaces an\nenormous pulse of water. It's a release of energy more\nthan 3,000 times the Hiroshima bomb, creating a tsunami. [radio chatter] [sirens] We could save a lot of lives if\nwe could predict these events. But we need to know a lot\nmore about what's happening down in these deep trenches. So we need the machines\nthat can go down there. JAMES CAMERON: Surface,\nDeepsea challenger. I am on the bottom. Depth is 12,164 feet. Over. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nI'm 2 and 1/2 miles down. Same depth as Titanic, which\nI've been to plenty of times. But always in subs\nthat were built by big government programs. No privately-built sub\nhas ever gone this deep. And then I've got to remind\nmyself, this is only a third of the way to where I'm going.  Oh, got us a critter. Got us a real critter here. Yes sirree, Bob. Time to zoom in on this one. That looks like an octopus. Yeah, love those deep octopus. I wonder what the\nhell he's thinking. [snapping sound] Oh, that's not good. That's not good. That snapping sound is not good. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWell, Don Walsh always says, if you hear a\nloud bang and you've got time to think about\nit, you're going to be OK.  Something just imploded. He's chasing me. You're a mighty\nwarrior, aren't you? JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): Each\none of these chance encounters is a gift from the ocean. And I'm grateful. This is my church. Down here alone,\nI feel the power of nature's\nimagination, which is so much greater than our own. [rhythmic music playing] Here we are with our\nhigh-tech equipment, diving in one of the wildest\nplaces on the planet. The rainforests of\nPapua New Guinea were the inspiration for\nthe landscapes in \"Avatar.\" So there's no way I'm not\ngoing to go ashore and explore. [chanting] We've been invited\nby the Baining people to witness their\nsacred fire dance. The ceremony suggests to me\nthe spirits of this land shaped by fire, by the\npowerful and dangerous forces deep in the earth. But the spirit\nworld doesn't cause the Earth to erupt, or cause\nthe sea to rise up in a tsunami. The only true path to\nunderstanding nature is science. That's why we're out here. That's why we're diving. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: In clear feet. Clear four. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nToday's dive is 27,000 feet, over five miles down. So this is the\nbig test before we can go on to Challenger Deep. And we're going to\nstart to squeeze all the submersible systems\nwith this extreme pressure. And we're also going\nto go to the limits of our communications\nand tracking.  Pulling out line.  Oh, no. That is getting pretty\nclose to the ship here. That's not good.  She's getting close. Hold it there. JAMES CAMERON: Guys, guys, guys. Come on. Guys, I'm looking right into\nthe starboard props here.  Keep it coming. Get it tied.  I bet they didn't intend that. JAMES CAMERON: And\nrelease, release, release. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): When\nthe dive begins, it's exciting. You know, the divers become\nlittle tiny stick figures, and everything just\nkind of disappears. And then you just\ngo into darkness. And you can see the\nplankton going by. And you just fall for\na long, long time.  Everybody says I can't\nstretch my arms out in here. I can stretch to\nthere, and to there 18,000 feet here in a second. It's the depth Bud Brigman\nwent to in \"The Abyss.\" I'm doing it for real. It's cool. Surface, Deepsea Challenger. Do you copy? Over. Surface, Deepsea Challenger. Do you copy? Over. JOHN GARVIN: ACOMMS, we're still\nreceiving Deepsea Challenger, but he is not acknowledging\nour transmission. Over.\n- Yeah. Copy.  I have no voice comms. OK, that's not too promising.  He's not hearing us\nor responding to us.  Depth gauge is not changing. Whoa. Just lost my thrusters. See, look.\nThis is not good. This is not good. My thrusters are running\naway, and they won't respond. Then they drive by themselves. I think we've got a problem. We get a lot of failures here,\nand I'm coming up to my depth. Without thrusters\nI can't even stop. This is not good. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nAs I'm going along things are starting to fail\nand glitch, one by one. Everything is going haywire, and\nI'm getting deeper and deeper. JAMES CAMERON: Plug's stopped. My depth gauge has stopped. Everything's stopped. Speed's 1.9 knots. I still can't stop from that. I'll hit the bottom too fast. I've got just a couple of\nminutes to sort this out.  We need to really know\nif this is an emergency.  This is going to be a mess.  ACOMMS, Mermaid ACOMMS. We have received\ntelemetry, but no vital--  I'm going to have\nto drop some shot. I'm going too fast. I'm going 2 knots. And dropping shot. Here we go.  270 feet. He's getting really close.  Oh, [bleep]. Stop. Surface, Deepsea Challenger. Descent is aborted. [chatter] JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): When\nyou're down to 27,000 feet, and one system goes,\nand another system goes and another system goes. And pretty soon, you\nrealize you're in this kind of dead, metal coffin. And if the weights still\ncome off, you're toast.  OK. Moment of truth. [applause and cheering] [laughter]  The good news is,\nit's now officially the deepest diving\nsubmersible in the world. Bad news is, never\nsaw the bottom. Had about five major\nsystems failures that prevented me from going on. What we've got to do\nis go through the tape and see exactly what the\nnature of the failure was.  We did take water ingress in\na couple of battery modules. So these are going to have\nto be taken off the sub, and repaired or replaced\nbefore the next dive. WALT CONTI: This is a prototype. And even though we might\nhave 100% spares on items, we're working\nthrough those items as we have problems on the\ndive Could come to a point where I could say I\ncan't repair this. JAMES CAMERON: When you\ndo these kind of projects, you hit so many hurdles. Well, I have to say, guys. I picked you guys,\nbecause you're smart, and you can do this. And we're going to\nhit hurdles like this, where we think we're stopped. That we're dead in the water. And we're going to think\nour way through it.  Touchdown. Surface, I am on the bottom. Depth, 26,970 feet. Lights are working, cameras\nworking, thrusters working. We did it, guys.  A lot of very\nhappy people up here. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): So I'm five miles down in the\nNew Britain Trench, a place that's never\nbeen explored before.  Oh, what's that? JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nAnd bang, right off the bat, I find what could be a\nnew species of jellyfish. [radio chatter] JAMES CAMERON: Copy\nyou loud and clear. I'm at the trench wall. I am working a steep rock cliff. Over. It's like the Alps\ncovered with snow here. That's cool. Tiny, little anemones\ngrowing out of the rocks. Look at that, huh? Beautiful little garden,\njust hanging out here at 27,000 feet. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nSo we've discovered this diverse ecosystem\nliving five miles down in the New Britain Trench. [chatter] JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nBut the biggest surprise comes from the\nlander, when we see what was attracted to our bait.  Holy cow. Amazing. Wow! This is really amazing. This whole trip,\nwe've only caught a trickle of small, tiny\namphipods, and maybe an isopod here or there. And now we have many\ndozens of giant amphipods. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): On one dive, the lander brings\nback four species, which might be new to science.  That really paid off. I mean, that's pretty amazing. I just can't believe it. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nOn the lander camera, it's a feeding frenzy. They're like deep sea\npiranha, devouring a chicken. JAMES CAMERON: Oh, look at that. SUZY AMIS CAMERON: Yeah,\nthat is clean to the bone.  This was a full chicken. But look at this. Look at how neatly they've\npicked every morsel of flesh off that skeleton. Look at that.  Absolutely perfect.  I mean, that's nice work. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThe five-mile dive was our last test. We're as ready as\nwe're going to be. It's time to go to the\ndeep end of the pool. The Challenger Deep is in the\nheart of the Mariana Trench. It's 1,300 miles farther north. It's a pit in the trench 40\nmiles long and two miles wide that's so deep, you could put\nMount Everest on the bottom with four Empire State\nBuilding stacked on top. And not even break the surface. OK, so we're coming\nup on the dive site. And we've got a problem. We were supposed to be\nout here a month ago. But now the trade winds\nare blowing every day, and the sea state's\ngotten pretty ugly. JAMES CAMERON: I've been\ndreaming about this place since I was a little kid.\nYou know, it's interesting. It just looks like any other\npiece of ocean anywhere. But it's knowing that\nseven miles straight down, below our feet, is the deepest\nplace in the world's oceans. The conditions are\npretty marginal. Probably about the\nabsolute limit that we can launch it right here. We're going to test\neverybody to the limit. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): So we're doing an unmanned launch\nto see if we can actually get the sub back on the ship.  OK, get lines nice and tight. Steady. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nIf it gets away on us, it's a 12 ton wrecking ball. JOHN GARVIN: Let her stabilize. Let her Stabilize. Goldy, line out. Steady now. Keep her steady. Take in all the slack. All the slack.\nCome on, Harmon. Get it in. Tight now, Gavin. Gavin, tight. All stop. Take her back into deep sea. Back into sea. Goldy, let your line out! JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): The\nonly way to stop it swinging is to drop it back in the water.  Keep it coming. Goldy, let her out. Let her out. Please, everyone,\nlet your lines out. All lines out. Get it out! OK, steady. Hold her there. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWe're over the limit. If the sea state\ndoesn't come down, there's no way I can dive.  Well, it's just\nthis weather window. It's like a gift from\nthe sea right there. Gives us a shot. It's already well down. Mid-afternoon, down holding. Past midnight, and then\n06:00 the following morning. That's when it starts\nto rocket back up. So that's our hard out. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): So\nnow it's finally the big dive. And we're going to launch\nat night in a heavy sea, which we never trained for.  Knowing that somebody's\nlife is at stake is-- is very, very stressful. And then you compound\nthat with an incredibly aggressive schedule. There are calculated risks. JOHN GARVIN:\nComplacency is a killer. The ocean can turn on\nyou in a heartbeat. So it's very important\nthat everybody is on their main game. [chatter]  OK, just get lines\nnice and tight. Steady. Hold that.\nStop. All stop. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nIf we don't dive now, then we've wasted our time. JOHN GARVIN: OK, steady there. All stop. All stop. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nBecause we're out of time. This ship's got to go back. JOHN GARVIN: Tighten her. Steady. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWe've got to dive. Even if it means we've got to\ndive at night, which we'd said we wouldn't do. Even if it means\nwe've got to dive in a 2 and 1/2 meter\nsea, which we said was beyond our capability. Now is where we\nreally have to pit ourselves against the elements.  And there it goes. Down. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nSo we're supposed to be trying to dive by\n0400, which is in 20 minutes. I predict we'll be about-- I'll be descending\nby about 4:30. A little bit late, but not much. Where I'm targeted right\nnow should be the deepest place on the planet.  There's, of course, an\nelement of fear in it. Because it's-- it's a risk. And-- but if you don't go\nout and do something in life, nothing happens. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): I'm\nonly minutes away from diving the Challenger Deep. And the guy who\ninspired that dream is right here on board with us. Don Walsh is back at the site\nof his own dive, 52 years later.  Thanks, baby.  Have fun.  It will be fun.  I love you.  Love you, too, baby.  All right, Jim.  Hi, buddy. See you in the sunshine.  OK. See you when you come out. All the best.  Godspeed below. Hustle up.  Yep. Got it.  And hold. Final checks. - Leads clear.\n- OK. Lower away. OK, Steve. When you're ready,\nman, you just pick up.  Coming up.  Keep running. Nice and tight, Donnie. That's a good angle, Donnie. That's great.\nGood. Well done, guys. Good. Stand by for that\ntransition, guys. Stand by for that transition. She needs to be taken up, Gavin. Good. Keep going, guys. Goldy, a bit more out, please. Careful, Donny. Hang on, Donny.  Here we go. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: Deepsea Challenger, you are 100 meters due north\nof your intended drop point. Over. JAMES CAMERON: Yeah,\ncopy that, Tim. Thanks. Hatch is not leaking. Hatch looks good so far. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE\nON RADIO: Yeah, Jim, we're going to-- if\nyou're comfortable, we'll pump both bags\ntogether once you're ready. JAMES CAMERON:\nSay again, please. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: Deepsea Challenger, five minutes to drop zone.  Copy, five minutes\nfrom drop zone. JOHN GARVIN: Deepsea\nChallenger, surface check. JAMES CAMERON: Yeah, copy that. Vision 1 is 20, 19, 19. Carbon dioxide, 0.5%. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: Looking good, guys.  Oh, man. We got a hatch deploy\non the soft ballast. JOHN GARVIN: The soft\nballast bag is deployed. The hatch popped.  Yeah, roger that. I can see that. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThe soft ballast as a key safety system. And if it blows, we're supposed\nto pull the sub out and fix it. But if we do that, we\nmiss our dive window.  All right, tell the\ndivers to cut it away. We're going without it.\nOver. JOHN GARVIN: Yeah.\nRoger. Standby.  Take everything.\nThe hatch, too. Over. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE\nON RADIO: Deepsea Challenger, your position update\nis two minutes to drop point. Deepsea Challenger, SO. Ready when you are. JAMES CAMERON: Yeah. Ready for descent. JOHN GARVIN: OK, just confirmed\nthe divers are in position, and then we're doing the launch. JAMES CAMERON: OK, ready\nto initiate descent. And release, release, release.  Had a bit of a rocky start. 4.6 knots. We're going like a\nbat out of hell here. Just the way we like it. Surface, surface. Deepsea Challenger. Depth 2 tick 0 0 feet. Speed, 4.2 knots. Over.  Deepsea Challenger. Copy. Understood.  Depth, 11,580 feet. Speed, 3.2 knots. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): I used to think Titanic was the\ndeepest place I could imagine. Now I'm sailing past\nthat depth like it's the foot of my driveway. 16,000 feet. That's the depth of\nBismarck, the deepest I've been before this expedition. But it's less than halfway\nto where I'm going. JAMES CAMERON: Surface,\nDeepsea Challenger. Depth, 1 8 0 0 0. External temperature,\n34.4 degrees. It's getting cold. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): So\nyou're doing all these things as you're going down. It's all on the checklist. You do this at this depth, and\nyou do that at another depth. And, you know, you're\nsetting up the cameras and booting up the sonar. Checking battery status. Testing the thrusters,\ncomms, navigation. Everything that needs to\nbe ready before you land. And it's all by the numbers. And then for the first\ntime, on any dive, I'm through my checklist. 27,000 feet. That's deeper than any other\nsub in the world can reach. Beyond any hope of rescue. And there's still\n9,000 feet to go. There's nothing to do but sit\nand think about the pressure building up on the hull. It just gets really quiet. It's peaceful. It's lonely. And you feel\nyourself just getting farther and farther and\nfarther from the world that you came from. JAMES CAMERON: Vertical\nrate is 1.3 knots. Time to shed some shot. Get some speed off here. 35,200 feet. 488 feet to go. Turn everything on. And number three. That's all lights facing down. Let's get the spotlighting down. Altitude, 110 feet. 100 feet. 78. Should be seen\nsomething pretty soon. Going down. There we go. We have bottom. OK, coming down. Easy, easy, easy. A little braking. Touchdown. [exhales] Surface, this is\nDeepsea Challenger. I am on the bottom. Depth is 35,756 feet. And, um, life support's good. Everything looks good  Oh my God. [applause]  Whatever I thought I was\ngoing to say at that moment, wasn't going to be that.  I bet this is\nhow the NASA team must have felt when the Eagle\nlanded this is just great. SUZY AMIS CAMERON:\nDeep sea Challenger. Deep sea challenger. Godspeed to you, baby. I love you.  Love you, too, baby. All the way from the\nheart of the ocean --heart of the ocean.  Oh! [laughter] JAMES CAMERON:\nSurface, be advised, I'm starting my\ntransect to the north. Over. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nGoing deeper into the ocean is going deeper into\nthe subconscious. So we have this fantasy\nthat the deeper we are, the bigger the monsters.  It's just flat\nand featureless. I don't see any animal tracks. . JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nIn reality, the deeper we go, the smaller the lifeforms.  No critters. No signs of critters. No tracks on the ground. Unbelievable. Like the moon. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nI know there are new species of bacteria in that sediment. But I have this powerful\nfeeling that I'd dive deeper than the limits of life itself.  All right, let's get\nourselves a sediment sample. Be advised, I'm taking\nmy contingency sample. Over. I see a lot of hydraulic\noil coming out. Looks like we got\nourselves a big leak. All right. I'd better get my\nsample while I can. I think we might\nhave a sample there. OK. Let's get a look at this watch. It's still ticking. Oh, yeah. 16,000 pounds per\nsquare inch, no problem. Uh-oh. This is not good. Oh, this thing is just dying. Yeah, hydraulics\nare completely dead. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nMost of our lives, we huddle together in the\nwarmth of human company. Down here alone,\nthere's a purity. You sense the vastness of\nall that we don't know. JAMES CAMERON: Oh, I think\nmy horizon just came up. I believe we have found a slope. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON RADIO:\nDeepsea Challenger, surface. Comms check. JAMES CAMERON: Surface,\nDeepsea Challenger. I am at the north slope. Over. That's cool. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE\nON RADIO: Copy that.  That's a little\navalanche there. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nSomebody has to go. A robot can't tell\nyou how it feels.  I did not come all this way\nto not see it with my own eyes. Well. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nIt's important to physically be here. To bear witness to the things\nthat have never been seen. To that little kid\ndreaming of going to the bottom of the ocean,\nall things seem possible. I wonder what\nother kids will do. Where they'll go. What they'll see. What new worlds await them.  Oh yeah. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): I hope there's some kid\nout there right now who's already\ndreaming of exploring worlds we can't even imagine.  Something feels wrong\nwith my thrusters. Ah, see. Look. I got three dead horizontals. All I can do is turn. Turn in a circle. Yeah, it just spins me around. JAMES CAMERON\n(VOICEOVER): It's time to go back to my own world.  Surface, Deepsea Challenger. Preparing to ascend. Over. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER): I\nhate this feeling, when you've got to leave and\nyou know there's still so much to see out there.  Weights are coming off. Boom. There they go. Surface, Deepsea Challenger. Weights are off. On ascent. Over. JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nWell, I'm just going to have to come back. Exploration is never done. JOHN GARVIN: You know,\nwhen you look around, and you see the faces\nof the guys who are just so proud that they've\nbeen part of this one man's dream and this\nadventure, it's pretty unique. You know, he's\ndriven us hard But we care about him immensely.  All teams stand by for\nrecovery on the starboard side. [applause and cheering] UNIDENTIFIED VOICE ON\nRADIO: Deepsea Challenger, Deepsea Challenger, SO. JAMES CAMERON: SO,\nDeepsea Challenger. Go ahead.  All right. Good to have you back, Jim. JAMES CAMERON: Copy that. Good to be back. JOHN GARVIN: Deepsea Challenger,\nwe're coming to get you.  You guys are my\nheroes in real life. [chatter] JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nThis sub is not just a machine. It's the hopes and dreams\nand will of all the members of the team made manifest. They are the soul of the\nmachine, and it is them. Only the people that\nare on this expedition will ever understand what it\ntook to accomplish the goal. And that will bond us together\nfor the rest of our lives. [applause and cheering]  We did it. We all do it. I was just the unlucky son of\na bitch that had to get crammed in here to go take the ride.  Hey, baby. [whistling] We did it, babe. That's a good kiss.  Did you see my shot? [laughs] Did you find my shot\npiles down there? JAMES CAMERON (VOICEOVER):\nI think every explorer has the same thing inside. They know that the risk is\nworth it because they're widening the pool of knowledge. It's important for us as a\nspecies to not lose that drive, whether it's in the oceans. Whether it's out in\nspace, going to Mars. Going to the outer\nplanets, to the icy moons. Whatever it is, we need to\nkeep that part of us alive. [music playing]"}
