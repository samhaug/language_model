in this video I'm going to teach you how to make Quito cheesecake this is a low-carb sugar-free blueberry cheesecake that I made over the holidays this year I was actually really delicious this cheesecake is pretty simple to make do you know how it is on keto sometimes you get those sweet cravings it's way better to make a low carb cheese Capon something then eat a regular cheesecake which can easily have up to 50 grams of carbs a slice so let's get into it so we're going to start off with making the crust we're gonna take 2 cups of almond flour we're gonna add it to a medium-sized Bowl cress is being made with almond flour which is really great alternative to using regular flour it's super low carb next we're going to take about three tablespoons or your favorite sugar-free sweetener I like to use swerve we're going to add that to the mixture and then we're gonna add about half a cup of melted butter to the mixture [Music] lastly we're gonna add in one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract I couldn't find my teaspoon so I'm gonna have four quarters of a teaspoon to the mixture thank I still laugh because I'm missing a lot of equipment for baking I don't have an electric mixer I'm gonna be using a wooden spoon so you're gonna mix that entire mixture up until it becomes really crumbly pretty much like a crust and if it's too crumbly and you don't think you can like push it together then I would say to just add maybe a little more butter to the mixture but next thing we're gonna do is take about a 9-inch pan I don't have one of the springform pans but ideally you would use one of those and we're just gonna grease the pan I'm using some coconut coconut oil Pam I'm sorry and grease it really good just to make sure that the crust doesn't stick when we try to take the cheesecake out and so the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to pour the entire mixture into the bottom of the pan and we're gonna Pat it flatten it evenly with a wooden spoon or spatula or your fingers or whatever you want to use you're just gonna Pat it evenly around the bottom and this is gonna make the crust of the cheesecake typically a normal cheesecake would you usually have a Graham crust but because we're doing keto we're gonna be using this almond crust feel free to add like spices and stuff if you wanted to have a different flavor to the crust I'm just doing a basic almond flour crusts with just some butter and vanilla so after we do that we are going to put it in the oven at 350 degrees and we're gonna cook it for about 15 minutes and then we're just gonna set it aside and let it cool down while we continue and go ahead and make the filling so the next thing we're gonna do is make the filling for the cheesecake I'm gonna take another large bowl about two and a half cups of full fat cream cheese it's about two and a half bricks philadelphia cream cheese if you use that and i'm going to take one cup of sour cream add that to the mixture and i'm using full fat sour cream i'm just gonna get that in there like i said before i don't have a mixer so please don't laugh i'm going to be using it wooden spoon and it might be a little difficult with the brick cream cheese so you might have to soften it in the microwave a little bit just to be able to mix it so we're gonna take about one cup of sweetened air I'm using swerve and we're just gonna mix up that entire mixture and make sure everything is smooth and so this might take a few minutes to do especially if the cream cheese is a little harder if you have an electric mixer just please feel free to use that I'm just using my wooden spoon gonna mix it up as much as I can try to get it smooth as possible so we're gonna take three eggs and we're going to beat them into this mixture one at a time so one by one we're gonna mix each one and then add the second and then the third and just try to make sure that you know you're getting all the lumps out try to get the mixture as smooth as possible because we just don't want any lumps in our cheesecake [Music] then we're going to take one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract again we're going to add it to our mixture again I forgot or I couldn't find my teaspoon so we're using four quarters again we're gonna mix that into the mixture and blend everything evenly then we're gonna take one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and if you don't have lemons or if you use the bottled lemon juice that's fine too you can just take a tablespoon of that add it to the mixture and at this point we're gonna mix everything together and by now this is all we're gonna put into the mixture if you taste this it should taste like cheesecake so we're gonna just mix everything up and make sure everything is blended smoothly and yep I'm tasting it and it tastes amazing so now we are gonna take out the crust and you can see that it's nice and cooked and we're just going to take our mixture and we're going to pour it into a pan on top of the crust and so we're just gonna make sure that its place in there evenly as you can see I forgot to spray some coconut oil to make sure it doesn't stick but yeah you should do that before I'm just gonna mix everything in there into the pot and get all of that batter in there and then we're gonna take the cheesecake and we're going to place it into the oven again at 350 degrees and cook it for about 45 to 50 minutes depending on your oven now we're just gonna get started on the blueberry topping this is optional it's a simple blueberry topping we're gonna take two cups of blueberries into our saucepan now we're going to take about one tablespoon of lemon juice again and as that I'm gonna take about a quarter cup of water to add to a mixture and we're also gonna take about three tablespoons of your favorite sweetener I ran out of Mysore so I'm just going to use xyla but you can use any sweetener that you prefer and if you haven't made a blueberry topping or any type tempura for topping before it's really easy you just take this saucepan you would just put it over medium heat and you pretty much just watch the sauce being made in front of your eyes the whole mixture will start bubbling up and then it'll turn into a sauce after it starts bubbling up you just put it on low let it simmer until it thickens and then you have yourself that I just feel great topping so now we're gonna take the blueberry topping and pour it on top of our baked cheesecake so we're gonna get it all on top of there make sure everything is even and the thing with cheesecake is that you can't eat it right away after comes out of the oven you have to let it refrigerate and be chilled for at least four to five hours before you should eat it because it's not set and so the best thing you can do is leave it overnight and our final result was this amazing decadent sweet and like amazing cheesecake it honestly doesn't taste like it's like sugar free or anything like that it tastes is like your regular cheesecake and if you didn't want to have the blueberries on top just to like get the carb count down lower that's totally fine this is an awesome awesome cheesecake I gave it again to my family they were blown away when I told them it was sugar-free I'm gonna leave the entire recipe in the comments don't forget to give a thumbs up if you liked this video and please subscribe for more videos and more recipes and keto vlogs you", "avByUWeY1e8": "(upbeat music) - If you love lemon and blueberry, then you are going to\nlove this cheesecake. It's thick, creamy, so delicious, and with the addition\nof some extra egg yolk, it really makes the lemon flavor pop. Cheesecakes can be a little confusing and not really complicated,\nbut time consuming, so if you haven't done one, I'm gonna show you\nexactly what to do today. I'm Lindsay from Life, Love and Sugar, and today we're making\nLemon Blueberry Cheesecake. (upbeat music) \u266a Oh, oh, oh \u266a \u266a Oh, oh \u266a - All right, so first up is your crust. We're making a graham cracker\ncrust for this cheesecake. So you're gonna put your\ngraham cracker crumbs into your bowl first. You can often actually\nbuy those already crushed which is really nice. And we're gonna add a little bit of sugar. And your melted butter. So mix all that together until\nthe crumbs are nicely coated. If you find you have any\nchunks left in there, you're gonna wanna take those out because those can kinda break\nup your cheesecake crust and make it a little more\ncrumbly when it's done. I like to spray the inside sides of my springform pan with a baking spray so that things don't stick, and then I line the bottom\nwith parchment paper to help make it easier to slide the cheesecake off the pan later when it's done baking. Then we're gonna add our crumbs. All right, you're gonna\nwanna spread them around. I like a nice thick crust that goes up the sides of the cheesecake as well as being on the bottom. So I'll push some extra\ncrumbs out to the side. And then you could grab a measuring cup or anything with a nice straight side, and then I use this to\nactually shape my crust and press it into the pan. So I'll start with the bottom and then work my way over to the sides and push the crust up the sides. And because this has a nice\nstraight side and good corner, it give gives me nice\ncorners in my cheesecake. All right, so once that's\nall pressed in nicely, I'll use my fingers to just\nkind of finish up the tops. All right, once everything\nis pressed into your pan, you can pop this in the oven for about eight minutes to bake. All right, so while your crust is baking, you can go ahead and\nstart on your filling. We're gonna start with our cream cheese. This should be softened. It's very important that this be softened, not too cool, because\nyou're gonna wanna mix your cheesecake filling on low speed so that you don't add too\nmuch air to your batter which can cause cracks in a cheesecake. So if this is not cool enough, you're gonna have to do more\nmixing than you wanna do in order to smooth it out. The warmer the better. Room temperature or warmer. Next, we'll add our sugar, and a little bit of flour. So again, we're gonna\nmix these on low speed and combine them until their\nwell combined and smooth. You can always scrape down the sides of your bowl\nand the beater blade to make sure that everything\nis getting well incorporated. I even like to scrape down\nin the bottom of the bowl, just so you're not getting\nchunks of cream cheese that stick down there and end up leaving lumps\nin your batter later. So once everything is combined and smooth, you're gonna wanna add your sour cream, your fresh lemon juice, and lemon zest. And then again, we'll\nmix everything together until it's nice and smooth. Next, you're gonna\nwanna add your egg yolks and your whole eggs. We've got two egg yolks here. And I like to use some yolks\ninstead of just all whole eggs because the egg yolks really amplify that lemon flavor and make it pop. Then again, you'll wanna\nmix everything together until it's smooth, and keep it on low speed. Now I'm just gonna gradually\nadd the other eggs, scrape down the side\nof the bowl as needed, and just kinda incorporate them, and then add the next one. Once that's all well combined, I like to make sure I give\neverything one final stir, and then we're gonna stir\nin our fresh blueberries. All right, so by now, your\ncrust should be baked and ready, so we're gonna grab our cheesecake crust and pour our filling into it. Okay, then I just like\nto take my offset spatula and smooth it around. The other thing to keep in\nmind with cheesecakes is one thing that can cause cracks is if you have chunky stuff in your filling and it rises to the surface. I'll actually push them down a little just to keep cracks from happening. So once you have this all spread in here, you're ready to go. You actually wanna prepare\nyour pan for a water bath. I know not everyone loves a water bath, but it really does make\na better cheesecake. One of the biggest\nproblems with a water bath is your pan leaking. As much as all springform pans claim that they're leak-proof, I've met maybe one ever\nthat was leak-proof, and it didn't stay that way for long. So I have a way of setting\nup my pans for a water bath that actually helps make sure that water's not gonna get it. The thing about aluminum foil is it's really easy for that to get tiny little cracks in it when you're wrapping your pan with it, so even though it seems\nlike water shouldn't get in with the foil, it actually does. A bag isn't gonna get tiny little cracks so you actually can set\nyour cheesecake in the bag, and then I wrap some\nfoil around the outside just in case, and then I put\nthat inside my water bath. Now that we've got that all wrapped, we're gonna set this inside a larger pan and fill it with warm water, and that's what actually\nmakes up our water bath. Just be careful not to\nget any of that water into your cheesecake. So this is just tap water, and you wanna make sure\nyou fill up the pan that you're pouring the\nwater into about halfway. You'll actually see that when you take the\ncheesecake out of the oven, a lot of it has evaporated. So you wanna make sure\nthere's enough in there. One other little tip that I have before you put your\ncheesecake into the oven, if you happen to notice some air bubbles rising to the surface, 'cause that does happen, you can use a little toothpick\nand actually pop 'em, and then you don't have\nproblems with air bubbles. Now we're gonna pop this\nin the oven and bake it. It's about an hour and 20 minutes at 300 degrees in your oven, and then there's kind of\na slow cooling process which helps this bake and not crack. You're actually gonna leave\nthe door of your oven closed, turn off the oven, and let it keep baking, but also let it start to slowly cool for about half an hour. And then from there, you're\ngonna crack your oven and let it cool for\nabout another half hour. While your cheesecake is in\nthe oven, you can go ahead and make your blueberry\nsauce for topping it. We're gonna start with some sugar, and then some cornstarch\nto help thicken things up. And then we're gonna add\na little bit of water. I'm just gonna add a couple teaspoons. You can add anywhere from\ntwo to four teaspoons. It just depends on how thick\nor thin of a sauce you like. Then we're gonna heat this until it all kinda starts to melt. So you're just kind of looking\nto get that sugar melting so you don't end up with\ngraininess in your sauce. All right, so the sugar\nis looking mostly melted so we're gonna go ahead\nand add our blueberries. And so now we just wanna\ncook our blueberries, again, over medium heat, until they start to pop\nand release their juices. Once the juices are coming out and you've got kind of a nice sauce going, keep stirring and letting it go until it starts to thicken. You just wanna be sure that you don't let it thicken too much. You gotta keep in mind that as it cools, it's gonna continue to thicken, so take it off when it's\nstarting to thicken, but not too thick so that you don't have like a chunky sauce, unless that's what you like. Okay, so now we've got our cheesecake. It has been baked, slowly\ncooled in the oven, and then cooled in the fridge\nfor about five to six hours so that it's nice and firm. This is actually a great\nrecipe to make ahead because you could just\npop it in the fridge and leave it there overnight and then finish it off in the morning. Let's go ahead and remove the sides. This should be firm enough that you can actually just\nslide it off of the pan, but if you're having trouble, you can use a little offset spatula. Just kind of run it along\nthe bottom to loosen it. You should feel it kinda loosen. And then I actually can slide\nthis right off onto my hand and pull off the parchment paper. Your cheesecake should be firm\nenough that you can do that without it falling apart. And actually, you can\nsee the parchment paper is actually coming right off on its own. If it doesn't, you can\nhold onto the cheesecake and pull it off, but often, it\njust slides right off for me. See, I'm just holding this, you could pull it off if you needed to, and then you can place this\nright on your serving plate. Once you've got your cheesecake on your serving plate and ready to go, we're actually gonna\nmake our whipped cream. You'll take your mixer bowl, you're gonna wanna use\nthe whisk attachment. We'll add our heavy whipping cream. You wanna make sure it's nice and cold so that it whips up well. We'll add some powdered sugar. This not only sweetens it a little bit but it actually helps\nstabilize your whipped cream so that it's not gonna wilt when it's sitting on\ntop of your cheesecake. I can actually leave this\nwhipped cream on a cheesecake in the fridge for like a full\nweek and it won't deflate, so the powdered sugar\nreally helps with that. And then some vanilla\nextract for good flavor. Then we'll just pop this on our mixer and whip it until you get stiff peaks. All right, so it's looking pretty good. When you lift this up, if your whipped cream stands up straight, you've got stiff peaks. Here's our piping bag. I've got a nice closed star tip. It's a large one, not too large. It's the 844 Ateco tip. And now you have your finished\nLemon Blueberry Cheesecake. Ready to go, perfect for\nserving for your guests or hoarding for yourself. It's thick, creamy, delicious,\nand so full of lemon flavor. It's perfect for spring and summer. I know you're gonna love it. For the full recipe, head\nover to LifeLoveandSugar.com. (upbeat music)", "B3EPwblxZ5Y": "hi guys larvae tally on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how to make a blueberry cheesecake ice cream does not require an ice cream machine which is perfect and it's kind of like a cheat ice cream I love love this cheesecake ice cream and then by making like a beautiful blueberry compote it just takes it to a whole new level I have shared with you how to make plain cheesecake ice cream about a year or so ago but I figure we elevate things up a little bit we are nearing the end of summer so you know mean and I think I know you we need to get our fair share of ice cream in here before the summer is over so let's start with a cheesecake mixture - cheesecake ice cream portion first you'll need cream cheese has been well softened at room temperature heavy cream sweet condensed milk and a little bit of lemon zest that is it so the first thing I'm gonna do is I am going to use my handheld whisk here to whip my heavy cream to stiff peaks that's it that's the first step how hard is that perfect I want it to be really nicely whipped now I'm just gonna take a spatula and just kind of give my cream cheese just a little schmear here to make sure that there are no lumps because I don't want it to be hard at all if your cream cheese is not to room temperature which should be otherwise it's all lumpy what you can do is you can pop it in the microwave of course take it away take it out of its package in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time and then you just keep testing it until it's ready I prefer to take it out the morning I think I'm gonna need it and just leave it out for several hours and it just spins up working the best so that's why I do it this way I'm pouring in my sweetened condensed milk which as you probably know has me salivating right now and I'm really trying to get every single little bit in my my bowl here with my cream cheese because otherwise I will eat it oh and then you just need a little bit of lemon zest the lemon says I like to put it in just about any cheesecake like really it brains things up you don't notice it a whole lot but this is not a lemon flavored cheesecake mixture but it definitely it takes things a long way I'm not gonna add any vanilla to this right now because I'm gonna add it in a little bit now I'm gonna do is I'm just going to bring my mixture back my little whisk here and just whisk this until it's nice and creamy and well combined that looks saving that for me this looks really creamy and beautiful no lumps no nothing now all I need to do is fold my whipped cream into my cream cheese a sweet condensed milk mixture now this ice cream you just kind of fold it in at this point now what you can do if you do have an ice cream machine and you want to get things moving along a little bit quicker at this point of course you would need to pop your ice cream into the insert your ice cream machine in the freezer the night before but what you could do at this point we go from here show your ice cream machine make us mix mix until it's frozen I'm not gonna do that I've got other things to do today and I don't really plan on eating this till tomorrow so it's not necessary but now what I'm gonna do to my mixture now that it's all light and gorgeous or just love it I'm gonna pop this into a container that has a tight-fitting lid pour it right in and now this needs to go into the freezer for just a few hours not until it's frozen solid otherwise what we're gonna try and do to it will not work just for a few hours so I'm gonna do that I cannot wait to lick the bowl so I'm gonna pop this in you're gonna have to go for a few seconds and then we'll proceed alright so now it's time to make our blueberry sauce now all you need is fresh blueberries a little bit of water what I've got here is some vanilla sugar and I've got a few pieces of the dried vanilla beans in there but sugar with a little bit of extract we'll do a touch of cornstarch and some lemon how you like my purple spoon this is my berry spoon every time I make a berry sauce a berry compote anything to do with heating up berries this is a spoon I use because it's faint so my base then it's Betty Betty nice get a very very nice in here in a saucepan we put your blueberries along with touch of water your vanilla sugar like I said if you don't have vanilla sugar which you should always have on hand you can use regular sugar which is a touch of vanilla extract but I really like having the nila sugar in hand because even if all you're doing is making like a cappuccino or something like that and you could just had a little bit of that in and it really gives you a beautiful aroma sort of subtle vanilla hue without it being too overpowering so that's why I love to always keep it on hand I'm just gonna pop this on the burner and cook this I would say for about four to five minutes or until most of my blueberries have popped and you've got a really nice sauce going these look fantastic you can see a lot of them have popped but some of them still retain their shape which is what I want to my little bit of cornstarch I'm gonna add a little bit of water mix that in want to dissolve the cornstarch what you're making is a little slurry to thicken these juices up a little bit not a lot because I mean it will thicken as well as they sit as the sauce sits in the fridge and cools completely and now all I need to do is cool this mixture for a cool cook this mixture for another minute or so and then I'm gonna pour it back into this jug and put it in the fridge to cool completely ice cream was in the freezer for about four hours or so it's not frozen solid but it's where we wanted my blueberry mixture once it cooked for another minute or so when we added the cornstarch slurry I put it back into this little jug and popped it into the fridge to cool completely and this is how easy this is you take your blueberry mixture not too much and try to focus on trying to get most of the chunks of blueberries and I like to put most of it in and then save some of the blueberry syrup to serve if you're gonna serve it in a cup put this on top tomorrow and then I kind of just swirl it in see that there's no specific way to do this you kind of just want to swirl it in that's pretty much it I don't want to add all of it because otherwise it wouldn't set the way I wanted to I'm gonna pop this into the freezer to set overnight and I'll show you what it looks like para or in a few seconds for you my ice cream set overnight I just let it come to room temperature for about five minutes or so I have it snacking on it you call me what can I do it is what it is so this is so good I cannot even tell you and I'm going to show you a couple of the ways that I really enjoy serving this you of course can just serve it take a big ice cream scoop obviously or whatever sighs first of all I want you to see just how gorgeous the color is - it's a pretty I just love it you do want us to come to room Shepherd temperature for a few minutes probably should have waited 10 minutes because ten minutes is like the golden the golden time for ice cream to come to room temperature you room temperature but you know what I mean and I want you to see this because I think this makes the biggest difference you see how yes there's blueberry so just running through it but there are still chunks of blueberries I think that is so important because you want to be able to still have a bite of a blueberry do you know what I mean cuz it can be really bright it can be really fresh it can be really mouth its watering it can be really just delightful so one way you can serve it is they sit like this and then you can do some crushed graham crackers on top or graham crackers cut them in half serve them with that great fantastic everybody's happy everybody loves it okay second way is you can make a little ice cream sandwich using graham crackers because get it you make a cheesecake crust using graham cracker so the two together like the ice cream with the graham crackers works super super well so that is what I'm going to do just kind of scoop out a large scoop trying to get the bottom two so that we've got some of the vanilla base as well the color of that there's that beautiful then you just pop that on there like so put another one on top gentle gentle gentle squeeze but press firmly cuz you want them to stick love it love it love it love it and then the third way you get these small little sugar cones from your regular grocery store they carry mull over the place I love these for entertaining because it makes that ice cream go really far because you don't need a whole lot and then you take a small ice cream scoop here and then you just look you pop that right in you just dump that in and you know I'm gonna go with this one because that's just what I like like a big scoop how cute is that it is so good I've been snacking on it it's it's really to die for mmm it's like really creamy really velvety but really bright as well hmm and now leftover blueberry sauce if you want to you can drizzle some on top some one there but really I make extra because it keeps in the fridge for a few days and it's fabulous over pancakes or waffles or just plain ice cream or whatever everyone loves it I'm just gonna dig into this but you get the idea make the ice cream serve however your heart desires take it from one ice cream lover to another which I think you are this is necessary on your table this weekend trust me hope you enjoy spend time with me to the recipe of course is al re and make it two not common at sea hi you", "_rujbPY4A44": "[Music] hi I'm Manju welcome to sharing cooking secrets today I'm going to show you how to make a vegetarian baked cheesecake no gelatine no eggs and it's a wonderful easy recipe so this recipe especially for my mom she loves my cheesecake the first step is to prepare the tip so I'm using the steel ring you can use it a loose bottom tin as well so how to prepare this I got some point over here and I'm kind of doubled it so a truck likes to shoot something and I'm going to cover the base with my foil like this make sure it's tight I just want to grease it my hands are washed so I'm just taking a little bucket and I'm just very lightly not too much butter I'm just greasing it so I'm actually just greasing the the Rings so this paper will stick nicely [Music] okay I hope you can see this now the second part is preparing the biscuit paste so I've got here about 160 grams of digestive biscuits I like digestive biscuits if you want to use any other biscuit like ginger nuts or Oreo whatever you want to use okay so you can do this in your mix E or your food processor but this is another way of doing this so I'm just going to put the biscuits in here and just with my rolling pin the spatula stop kind of should look like son I have here 25 grams of butter which a lot of people skip this part but I like to roast the biscuits a bit so add the biscuits and just roast this for about 10 minutes on a low flame this can easily burn so be very careful keep stirring and you'll know when it's done because you get a lovely aroma coming out from the biscuits once they roasted so I think this is done now I need another tray like this and I'm gonna place this in here [Music] press the biscuits down you can put this on the side as well if you want and you can use the back over of say a bowl or something press it down like this [Music] press it down firmly and now we're going to put this in the fridge for about an hour now let's prepare the batter for the cheesecake so this is like one packet it's about 227 grams so we're using this so put that in there this is 20 grams of flour 75 grams of powdered sugar and 100 ml of cream this is double cream [Music] now all we need to do is just beat this all together so again I just like to mix it a bit before I put this on [Music] again team decides once so you get a nice uniform batter you want to mix this for a good five minutes something that's done so this is the butter or the cheesecake so we're going to now put this cheesecake mixture over the biscuits now with an offset then to palette knife just spread it all over try and make it as level as possible you get some water and we're going to put this in the trick so the water should come about halfway up this is a water bath so now we're going to bake this in a preheated oven 150 degrees for about 40 minutes so oven is preheated and carefully lift it [Music] 40 minutes on 150 so I think our cheesecake is ready so let's try and take it out [Music] now I want you to see the Cheesecake now how do you know it's ready we've baked it for around 40 minutes and it should be a little loose little soft on top so if you kind of move it you may feel that it's wobbling can you see it bubbling it should be like this because after this stage we have to keep this in the fridge overnight or minimum four to five hours so our cheesecake has been in the fridge overnight and now we're going to remove it and try and take it out of the tin so first of all let's take off the foil paper like this now you have to do this very patiently remove it and just be very careful and put it on a plate or a base and now gently we need to remove the ring so if you want you can use the help of some hot water get some hot water and a knife and this kind of loosen it a bit from the sides and wait a few minutes because it's been in the fridge so it's um it's a bit cold so let it just soften for about 15-20 minutes outside and that will help you to release it from the tin easily now what you need to do is maybe just stretch the tin slightly like this just trying to loosen it okay put your hand on top and just lift the ring up very gently you don't want to damage you your cheesecake okay so this comes up and now we just remove the butter paper make sure you get all the paper out so if you feel you need to just check the finishing just dip your knife pallet knife into the hot water and you can just like fix any part which has become a bit messy so here I have my blueberry filling and you can put strawberry filling blueberry filling apricot filling what whatever you like it's no hard and fast rule always make what whatever your family likes and your friends like not what you like so just spread this all over [Music] put a nice generous layer [Music] it's fine thing that's perfect you don't really need any garnish on this but I have this chocolate flower ready so I'm just going to place it here [Music] [Music]", "tH6jmAXaBLo": "this is what we're making these look awesome that is what we're making today we're making Kido cheesecake minis or just mini cheesecakes now cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts but I've never actually made a proper Kido cheesecake the first step in this recipe is making a blueberry sauce or kind of a blueberry jam and it's really easy it's just blueberries and swerve swerve confectioner's so that's people look at sugar as a natural ingredient and they look at something like erythritol or even stevia as artificial but the thing is those are natural as well they're not like aspartame that's more of like a chemical erythritol and stevia are both natural products so using them in place of sugar isn't a bad or worse thing it's just a different thing that cuts out the calories and cuts out the carbs blueberries are okay blueberries are pretty low carb so for the whole cup of blueberries is about 21 grams of carbs before the serving size that it's gonna go into it drops quite dramatically berries tend to be more keto friendly than some other fruits so if you wanted to go with strawberries or raspberries or even blackberries those would all be totally fine and what heat are you using here so this is a medium heat mm-hmm then we just let it come to a boil make sure all that confectioner is mixed in there until it dissolves and then we can actually let that simmer for a few minutes once it got hot and bubbly we let it sit and simmer for about ten minutes to burn off any excess moisture and really condense it into a jam there's thing for a crust we have our fine ground almond flour the great thing about almond flour is that it's a one to one for regular flour so any recipe that calls for regular white flour you can substitute almond flour instead and then we have brown swerve brown swerve yeah so we use swerve confectioner over there and this is a different swerve product right so this would be like your placement for brown sugar you can find swerve online as well as retail centers like Walmart but the brown swerve specifically Kay said was a little bit harder to come by so you may have to pick that one up online and then we're gonna use a quarter cup the full fat butter we put the softened butter almond flour and brown swerve in a state mixer and just spun it up on a low speed until it was all combined this made for like a wet sand consistency and I think looking at it it's gonna make for a really good crust what we're gonna do is go back to check on the blueberry sauce yeah yes our blueberries are cooked way down and now we can take it off the heat on the stove add it into the blender okay so like this is just to kind of get all the clumpy blueberries out right you want it pretty smooth after cooking they're still gonna be some larger chunks of blueberry so we put that in a blender to really spin it down and smooth it all out all right so we're just pouring into cup letting it cool okay so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna prep our pan to go into the oven so what I have is a 1/2 baking sheet and then this is a mini cheesecake pan see the bottoms come out that's so cool so it's pretty easy if you don't have a mini cheesecake pan you can also use a cupcake or muffin tin and use liners these disks are great but it's not quite a perfect seal so you do want to line the bottom with tin foil just in case there are any leaks the tin foil will also protect the mini cheesecakes from the water bath that's added later and we're gonna use avocado oil spray to make the cheesecakes easy to remove you want to use a nonstick spray we're using an avocado oil spray that is actually just avocado oil there's no chemicals or additives pure avocado oil how much are we putting in of the crusts so what we're gonna use is this is a 1 tablespoon scoop okay and we're just gonna fill it and then flatten it out do it what it kind of tightly packed or what's tightly packing and then while you're doing that I'm gonna go behind you and I'm using a wooden pestle you could even just use a spoon or a scoop that will fit in the pan just to get them flattened I used about half of the mixture for these 12 mini cheesecakes because this recipe will actually make two dozen mini cheesecakes or one 9-inch cheesecake you're gonna wipe the top off before we add in the actual cheesecake filling yeah I see all the oil on top we want to get all of them burn and then here you can actually have the option if you want to precook your cross you can put in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes if you want a more golden crust or we can just set this aside for now and start making our cream cheese filling let's do the filling and now for the best part the filling this is the Cheesecake two 8-ounce blocks of cream cheese that are room temperature 2 eggs room temperature temperature about 3/4 cup is a swerve as well sort of confectioner's its worth on everything vanilla and then what's this this is lemon juice lemon juice yes of course there was the cream cheese and vanilla extract but I didn't realize lemon juice was a part of most cheesecake recipes and then for the sour cream we are going to do 3/4 cup I think all those flavors help kind of balance each other out so it's not really cream cheesy it kind of has that fun tang enos that you get with a cheesecake locking it in place slow slow we're gonna add in 2 teaspoons each a lemon and vanilla you want to use pure vanilla imitation you're gonna need to use more and then it's just gonna water down your recipe and we're gonna add in the confectioner then we're gonna add in one egg at a time one thing Kay told me to make sure to never do is never over mix your egg you over mix them it can cause the Cheesecake to crack in the oven slow and steady that's what they always tell you in grade school slowly steady wins the race yeah to make this easy we put our cheesecake filling in a squirt bottle can actually cut the tip off so a little bit more comes out but this may pouring it into each little cup really really easy so wait now can I eat this are you like like it's gonna egg in it how do you feel about that I'm not scared that's gonna be so good some sugar substitutes tend to have a weird aftertaste but I didn't notice anything with the swerve it tasted just as sweet and good as regular sugar you want to fill each cup almost to the top these do expand a little bit in the oven but after they cool they settle back down so really where you fill it it's how big they're going to be it's like a really runny mayonnaise so if you really like mayonnaise you can put your man he says squeeze by like this I have to tip off to just make sure you label it to top these off we're gonna add that blueberry sauce just a little bit goes a long way and this adds that nice pop of color and a little bit of blueberry flavor to the Cheesecake Kate taught me this really cool marbling technique that really makes a cheesecake stand out just add a couple dots of the blueberry sauce to the top of each cup and then swirl it with a toothpick and sort of like a figure eight pattern however you want to do it get creative but this adds that marble texture and look to the top of each cheesecake that really sets it apart the last step before putting these in the oven is to boil some water and add it to the tray around the cheesecakes this hot water is gonna create a water bath and all that water is gonna steam in the oven keeping the Cheesecake nice and moist so you probably want a nice baking sheet for this and I wanted like the lopsided vent ones right hey yes so you definitely want to keep it flat when we can open up our oven we have it preheated at 350 you can use the bottom rack or you could Center it and all depends on your oven and then it will be perfectly done in 20 minutes 20 minutes that's it exactly easy now that the mini cheesecakes are done baking we have to let them sit out on the counter for about 30 minutes to an hour to let them kind of cool down and set after that pop them in the fridge for another three to four hours overnight is even better to really let them set and firm up and cool off oh these look so good yeah so you see how they flatten out once you let them set for a while yeah halva that they rose in the oven now it's all like back down after they cooled for what like four hours yeah they look so good can we try them of course debating I want the whole thing or just a little bit these things are delicious they taste just like the real thing and there are about only four net carbs per mini cheesecake so it makes a great snack or even dessert oh there's like the perfect keto dessert I love the like the graham cracker kind of crust that you would have normally on like a cheesecake well I'd done with flour that's so good I know like the keto fat bombs are really popular all right but this is like sort of the same thing just in a more traditional kind of recipe this is this is fun doing it kind of outside the box doing something fun some special that tastes just like the real thing but as keto friendly and you only really had to swap out two ingredients couldn't be easier this it's nice to know that when it comes to keto and specifically keto desserts you can have your cake and eat it too that's cheesy that's how you David wants to make sure his cheesy joke makes it into the Edit", "VGQFEiyMe-M": "Put the blueberries and sugar in the pot Turn on the light and cook over medium heat When it boils, reduce it to low heat and boil it while stirring Boil it until it thickens Add lemon juice and boil a little more Grind gently in a blender when cool Remove the cream, pour the melted butter in the crumbling Oreo and mix well Place in a 15 cm mousse and flatten Cookies can be used for other things (I chose the colors for Oreo and Blueberry) Leave it in the fridge for a while Leave soft cream cheese at room temperature If you take it right out of the fridge, it's soft for about 10 seconds twice in the microwave. Add sugar and mix Add plain yogurt and lemon juice and mix well Soak it in cold water for 10 minutes to remove the water and spin it in the microwave for 10 seconds to add melted gelatin and mix quickly. Add the whipped cream (slightly whipped blade) and mix gently I'm going to use half of the dough first so I transferred it to the beaker to see the amount. Pour half the dough into the mold Sprinkle the blueberry puree you made freely Pour all the remaining dough over it Sprinkle blueberry puree freely on top of it Stir the top slightly with chopsticks and harden in the fridge for about 30 minutes Mix the blueberry puree with fresh cream Add gelatin melted in water and mix The color is so pretty ~~ Pour over flat cake, flatten, and harden in fridge for 3 hours Cover the mold with a steam towel and melt it slightly Please lift the mold and remove it. The top is decorated with blueberries and rosemary. I like the look like an elegant necklace ^^ It's a cheesecake that loves color and tastes like What about the cut section? Pounding The puree sprinkled in two is naturally gradated and slightly flows to stimulate the salivary glands. The power of blueberries with beautiful colors without coloring! Rich flavor of sweet and fragrant blueberries! It's really delicious but ... Did you have fun? Always be healthy and happy ^^ Then see you again ^^", "iCmnGUY-UoA": "hi everyone and welcome back to my kitchen today i'm going to be sharing one of my all-time favorite cheesecake flavors and i'll be making my blueberry cheesecake with blueberry whipped cream on top and this cake is just bursting with berry flavor we're going to be adding blueberry preserves and fresh blueberries directly into the cheesecake batter then top the cake off with a light and fluffy blueberry whipped cream that you are going to want to eat with a spoon it is so good now i'm going to making this cheesecake batter with a combination of cream cheese and ricotta cheese which just makes the fluffiest and lightest cheesecake ever you guys are gonna love it let's get started and i'll show you just how easy this recipe is to make and i'm going to get things started with my graham cracker crust so into my food processor i'm going to add an entire package i think there's nine crackers in this one just going to drop it right in you just want to pulse these cookies until fine crumbs form and then into my cookie crumbs i'm going to pour in a quarter cup of melted butter and i'm using unsalted butter today and then pulse this again just until the crumbs are well coated and before i transfer my graham crackers into my spring farm pan i'm going to wrap the bottom of my pan with a large sheet of foil this is extra wide foil it's typically labeled as grilling foil because it's a bit nice and big size and this way you don't have any leaks so just wrap the sides and i'm doing this because i'm going to be using the water bath method for baking my cheesecake and i don't want any of that water seeping in and ruining my crust transfer the crumbs right into the pan and then to level off the crumbs inside the pan i'm using a potato masher and it just makes this process super easy you want a nice level crust press it firmly into the bottom of the pan and today i'm using a nine inch springform pan my crust is all ready to go so i'm going to set it aside for now and get started on that cheesecake batter so i have three eight ounce packages of softened cream cheese i let it stand at room temperature for about an hour so it's really nice and soft and i'm going to drop it into my mixer bowl and the last of my cream cheese is going into the mixing bowl and now for mixing the cream cheese so i like to mix my cream cheese with a whisk attachment on medium speed for about seven to nine minutes and i scrape down the mixing bowl very often to get all the cream cheese incorporated you want to get that cream cheese really creamy and smooth and stopping to scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl is really important otherwise you might end up with clumps of cream cheese in the cheesecake batter and nobody wants to bite into that so make sure to stop and scrape down frequently my cream cheese is so light and fluffy just how i want it and now i'm ready to add the rest of my ingredients so into my mixing bowl i'm going to add in 1 cup of white granulated sugar 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 4 large eggs just drop them right in and i'm going to mix this again for about three to four minutes and i'm going to stop every minute to scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl until the eggs are really well beaten and now for my next ingredients i have a one cup of whole milk ricotta cheese i'm going to drop that in and this ricotta cheese really helps the cheesecake stay super light and fluffy you guys are going to love this edition and i have half a cup of blueberry [Music] preserves i'm going to mix in the ricotta cheese and the blueberry preserves for about a minute [Applause] and this cheesecake batter is so smooth and creamy and now i'm ready for the last ingredient and that's my fresh blueberry so i'm going to drop in about a cup and a half of fresh blueberries and then grab my spatula and fold them right in and this batter is all ready and i'm going to pour the cheesecake batter in over my prepared crust and now this next step is optional but if you wanted to garnish the top of the cheesecake before it goes into the oven you can add little bits of blueberry jelly on top now what i did was i just grabbed a couple tablespoons of blueberry jam and i thinned it out with a little bit of water so it's a little bit easier to pipe i'm going to just add little dollops of that on top and now i want to show you how i prepare my water bath and this step is actually easier done when the cheesecake is on the oven rack i just wanted to show you guys here on the counter so it's easier to see i just place the cheesecake onto a large baking sheet and i'm going to fill it up with water so you want quite a bit of water in there because it will evaporate as the cheesecake bakes but this extra moisture in the oven is just going to help keep the cheesecake level and help prevent any cracks from forming on the top and this cheesecake is ready to go into my preheated oven it's going to bake at 315 degrees fahrenheit for about an hour and 45 minutes to two hours when it's done the center will still have a little bit of give but slightly wobbly at that point what i like to do is turn off the oven and then prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon just so it doesn't shut and i let the cheesecake cool completely in the oven it usually takes about two to three hours until it's completely cooled and this way it's not going to crack as it cools and it's a really nice slow cooling process once it's cooled i'm going to place it into the refrigerator and let it chill overnight and i'll come back to add our blueberry whipped cream on top next i'm going to be making my blueberry whipped cream so you want to make this once your cheesecake is chilled and you're ready to serve i have two cups of chilled heavy cream i'm going to add in about one cup of confectioner's sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract and i'm going to grab my hand mixer and whisk this for a few minutes until stiff peaks form and the last and most important ingredient is the blueberry preserves i'm going to add anywhere from a quarter cup to half a cup of the blueberry preserves straight into the whipped cream and then grab your mixer again and mix this just until the blueberry preserves are incorporated it takes just a few seconds [Music] and this blueberry whipped cream is just so light and fluffy check that out i'm just transferring it into a pastry bag i've tipped it with a star tip we're going to pipe it on top of the cheesecake now this recipe makes quite a bit of whipped cream it's extra whipped cream that you could serve on the side if you don't want any extra just cut this recipe in half and i have a second cheesecake that i baked last night just so that i could show you guys how to take it out of the pan and how to decorate it this cake is all cooled i let it chill in the refrigerator overnight and today i wanted to show you guys how to remove the springform pan without the cheesecake sticking to the sides for this little trick you're going to need a kitchen torch we're going to use a kitchen torch and just heat the pan along the edges and that just helps release the cheesecake from the side so when you take off the pan nothing sticks to it so let's do it and when you're doing this you want to make sure that you're not touching the actual pan because it's going to get very very hot so let the pan cool for a few minutes after you do this and then to transfer the cheesecake onto a stand i'm going to grab a flat cake spatula and slide it underneath the crust to kind of work my way around make sure that the crust is completely disattached from the pan then we're going to carefully just let the cheesecake slide right off and now let's garnish the top with that whipped cream today i'm using a taco tip number 847 i'm going to pipe generous dollops of that cream on top [Music] all right let's cut into the stunning cheesecake to see what it looks like on the inside and it's just such a beautiful cake all right let's check this out i love that there's actually whole blueberries they've kind of settled at the bottom this is going to be so so delicious [Music] and that is it guys for my blueberry cheesecake for the full recipe don't forget to head on down in that video description box i've left a link there that'll take you over to my website so you can print this recipe off and share it with your family and friends and i absolutely love how this cheesecake turned out with that extra blueberry whipped cream on top it just looks so stunning time to dig in and enjoy now i do have quite a bit of whipped cream left over so again if you're not going to be having extra whipped cream on the side you can just cut the recipe in half i'm going to grab a little bit of that whipped cream this cheesecake is just so light and fluffy it's just unbelievable oh there's a little blueberry on the bottom gonna grab that as well wow this is so good you guys are going to be blown away with the flavor of this cheesecake there is so much berry flavor bursting in every single bite i love the whole berries they've kind of sunk down to the bottom of the cheesecake but if you do get one of them they're just so delicious and then the cheesecake itself is flavored with the blueberry preserves and then you have the blueberry whipped cream on top you cannot ask for a better blueberry cheesecake if you love berries this cheesecake is definitely a must try i also really really like the texture of the cake

fine crumbs I do not want like a fine powder but you know there are those big crumbs as well inner 120 ml of melted butter I prefer unsalted one because generally biscuits do have a little bit of salt in it and a little bit of sure it kind of balances out when the butter doesn't have salt in it now just mix it you don't have to make a dough out of it it will be little crumbly and that's good I like that texture to me so our biscuit base is ready now let's prep for the moon what I'm doing is I'm making individual cheesecakes so in the market we get these thick plastic strips which you can just fold like this and just place them now if you do not get these strips do not deprive yourself of making this cheesecake what you can do is you can make this in a loose bottom pan as well that's it all right let's go to one spoon and each okay take anything that is flat and you can use to just push it down press it tightly as tightly as possible die a biscuit base is in the mold we can keep it in the fridge just for a while very prep for the cheesecake filling so for the filling let's start with 250 grams of melted white chocolate to that add 100 ml of melted unsalted butter now give this a gentle whisk alright next we need 200ml of whipped cream alright next we need 350 grams of cream cheese okay we'll just little bit soft inner it needs to be active in temperature we add around 100

today we are cooking pancakes i know some of you are going to be really happy about this video because i have received some messages some inquiries about pancakes okay so i'm going to give you guys we're going to start with some tips and um some recommendations okay so as always make sure that you are prepared with all of your ingredients the tools that you need as um being prepared as much as you possibly can um this takes away from the angst um yeah that's all i got it just does that all right so um i'm gonna do something today and i don't want to um i'm gonna just say it like it is this is a wow factor it most certainly is and it is semi homemade and i want to tell you why it's on my homemade today because we are making blueberry cheesecake pancakes that's what we're making they will be based out of a regular um a regular pancake that doesn't have the topping and the cheesecake component so this can you know you can most certainly use this um pancake recipe without the blueberry cheesecake component but that is what i'm doing today because that's what i have a taste for now it is semi-homemade because i am not making my own no-bake cheesecake filling today i'm still resting my hand up as much as i can um but philadelphia makes a wonderful wonderful product this is a new discovery for me okay it is called the no bake cheesecake filling all right i tried it this is my second time trying it it is absolutely delicious homemade is phenomenal but this is delicious too so um don't fret when there is a store brought item that you can purchase that tastes really good and it possibly can save you a lot of time and minimizes um you know you purchasing a lot of ingredients that you might not normally purchase and you may have leftovers and they you know possibly can go to waste because it's not something that you cook with often certain things like this you most certainly can go and buy this was i think it was like five dollars or something like that and it's 24.3 ounces there's a lot that you can do with this you can put it on the topping for pancakes like we're doing today put it on a waffle um put it on ice cream um what else can you do with it that i can think of the top of my head you can make a no-bake cheesecake you can go and actually get a already made graham cracker crust that is in the bacon aisle put this in there put it in the refrigerator let it get you know um more solid maybe if that is what i didn't try it so i'm thinking maybe that's what you can do you possibly no no it says that you can spawn it into a pie crust smooth it and then ready to serve it in under two minutes i mean hey it doesn't get any more simple than that uh i would think that i probably wanted to be as cold as it possibly can be um especially if i was going to top it with a topping i probably would put this together put it in the fridge you know plan ahead to put it in the fridge then i would either you know make a topping or also you could buy a can topping put it on there and then i would put it back in the fridge just to try to give it as much structure as it could be see look at that we will be talking about pancakes and what did i do went into completely something else typical right um and listen i am also going to be stirring every now and again my blueberry combo which is a part of our what's going to be a part of our blueberry cheesecake pancakes um but i am going to have a separate video for you guys for the blueberry compote okay so sorry about that i went completely off topic but i think it was helpful so you know no harm no foul all right so let's get into some recommendations all right krusty's lightning fluffy sweet cream now there is a chef that i am following on instagram his name is chef otis he made this recommendation shout out to you chef otis i absolutely fell in love with this pancake mix after um you posted it and i went out and found it i found it in my area at full king you know what's crazy i'm noticing that a lot of items that i have been looking for recently um they're at full king which is not a market that i necessarily frequent but it's happening more often now happy about that okay so this is the new pancake love of my life and waffle as well the sweet cream by krusty's this before i found out about krusty's was my baby this is the stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix i find this at macy's on macy's website and then also giants some giant food stores actually carry a few stone wall kitchen items you can find that this there as well they also have some really good syrups some really good aiolis i actually like um stonewall kitchen what they had to offer all right but i'm not using this on wall kitchen because right now i'm i'm really in love with this it's not replacing it this is kind of my second one and a half 1.2 this is where that is but i will tell you that this is the closest that i have found for a pancake waffle mix that resembles cracker barrel to me um i really do love to go inside of cracker barrel and um eat pancakes when i go there they're really really good um and i believe that i like them because you can taste the cornmeal and their pancakes it's really really good but again we're doing the sweet cream presses today and i actually am going to follow the instructions on the back i'm going to follow it um almost close to what it says we're going to make a few tweaks but it's not going to be you know so much i promise it's going to be really close to what they recommend okay so i get my measuring cups out because it says to make six to seven pancakes you need one and a quarter cups of mix and two thirds cup of cold water now i am going to turn our griddle on right now because for pancakes you want a nice warm hot griddle okay first thing that i did well i will tell you that my first ingredient that i added to this was butter melted butter this is a half a stick of melted butter i put it in my pyrex measuring cup i popped it right in the microwave for about what 45 seconds and we had melted butter so now i kind of comply with the instructions right it says two-thirds cup of cold water i am going to use two-thirds cup of cold milk so let's recap real quick half a stick of melted butter which was not on the instructions and then i'm swapping out the cold water for cold milk okay so i do have a half a stick of butter in here i am i'm gonna do the right thing guys i'm gonna do the right thing and i'm gonna get another measuring cup and measure out two thirds and again to start out we are following the instructions closely as possible just with a few of the alterations again i added the butter and i swapped out the water for the milk but i am keeping the measurement of the two thirds right now so i combined the cold milk and the butter and now i'm gonna go for a tablespoon of vanilla now the only reason why my vanilla looks probably looks a little different than the packaging that yours comes in is because i made mine and i will um i think i promised you guys that video before i i am still going to do that i promise you um but i make my own vanilla and um i have about four jars of it that i try to keep in rotation um but yeah i promise i got that one coming for you guys um it's very simple to make i promise you it is um and i don't know if you guys can see what the size of my jar um i can almost promise you that it is much more affordable to make it yourself okay so i have the butter the milk and the vanilla right okay so now i'm going to take our spoon and i'm just going to give everything a light little stir just to try to combine everything together as much as we can and then i am going to add our mix and it says that we are going to add one and a quarter cup okay and you see i can i have been using it almost it's really good so i'll go in with the cup measure that out dump it right in take the quarter cup do the same thing dump that right down okay now i get to stir i stir it lightly okay i don't know how many times i just maybe about 10 times right now what i do i need a so let's recap again the instructions say one and a quarter cup of mix which we used two-thirds cup of cold water we actually used cold milk i added a half a cup of melted butter i mean i'm sorry half a stick of melted butter and now i'm gonna take one egg put that right in and i'm just going to stir it around after we beat this a little bit i'm going to see what our consistency is when i'm making pancakes my biggest suggestion is to evaluate the batter on consistency and thickness to see if you possibly need to add any other ingredients i'm actually really happy with this consistency right now but what i will tell you is you want a kind of pourable batter like this if you beat your batter and you notice that it is too thick i would say to add a tablespoon of milk at a time until it reaches the appropriate consistency that you are looking for and your consistency is um assessed on the thickness of or the texture of the pancake that you actually like um let me show you guys this is kind of let's see if i can show you guys really good this is kind of the texture of what i like my pancake better to be just like that but again if you like a more thicker pancake you may want to add more of the mix if you like a thinner um pancake or you know you possibly may fancy some type of a crepe you want to have a thinner batter okay and it is very important that you don't um over mix or over beat your pancake batter um and that was the reason why i added the egg in at the point that i did to try to minimize some of that over beating um of the egg which would affect the overall texture of our batter okay so i'm going to turn you guys a little bit over to the griddle and i'm going to take some butter our griddle is warm i'm just going to turn the heat up a little bit and i have my pancake spatula here and i also have my pancake serving tray which i am going to place our pancakes on when they are done all right okay so we just take some of our butter and we rub it right on the griddle that sizzle gives us the indication that our griddle is hot which is where we want it to be i go back to my batter and it has thickened a little bit and let me let me show you guys something so at this point i need to lower the heat you see this that has thickened on me and it has thickened from the heat that's in the kitchen um and with it being sitting for just just a few minutes it has expanded some it happens at that point we just make an adjustment right so i assess the thickness where i want it to be i think i really only need about one tablespoon of milk so i'm just to do a quick little dash like that and i'm going to give it a stir just a couple that's what happened when you wear puffy sleeves in the kitchen let's see it's getting better maybe like a teaspoon now just a little teeny okay all right okay i'm back where i want to be that consistency there so now i go back to the griddle i turn the heat back up turn the heat back up and now i lay down our pancakes okay right from the measuring cup i lay them right down just like this and i pour them to the point where i have space to flip just like that i'm gonna put one right here then i'm gonna put another one right here now we let them rise from the heat your pancakes will tell you when they are ready for you to flip them they will begin to bubble and then you will see this turn from a liquid to more of a solid it's going to do with the bubbles are going to start in the middle then they're going to go out to the edges and you just give them just a couple of minutes to really you know for the heat to activate those ingredients and turn it again from a liquid to more of a you know a form of a solid and a lot of cooking is um a patience game and let me tell y'all i struggle with having patience it's so funny that i bake which takes patience and cook which also takes patience and i i struggle with it it's so funny okay but our pancakes now have bubbles they have bubbles all throughout the pancake for these two as a right now these two they're they're working on it so um that kind of tells me that the heat is kind of uh being dispersed to the left side of the griddle um at a higher rate than on the right side so i'm just going to look at them i'm going to check them real quick so i just give it a nice little lift on the end and there this one is time to flip i take this little trusty little spatula scoop it right up flip it um i'm going to zoom in and show you guys because these are those crispy edge pancakes that the majority of us actually love and i'ma check these two which they don't have as many bubbles but they are good to go as well and again it was really important to leave yourself flipping room okay let me see how far i can bring you guys in you see those those are the crispy edge pancakes yummy i'm a big crispy age pancake fan so yes um i attribute the crispy edge pancakes to the butter that i lay down on the griddle i have um received some comments to let me to share their experiences with pancakes and some have told me that they use oil some say that they use cooking spray i'm a butter girl and i receive my best results with using butter butter is my method and these are our crispy edge pancakes and they have a very very lovely light texture um because we did um refrain from over beating which is a plus um so they are very very light and they are very easy to um cut with the fork and and i'll show you guys once we actually assemble our pancakes um with the cheesecake filling and also the blueberry compo okay so we are going to get situated we're going to clean up a little bit um and then we'll come right back to finish out our blueberry cheesecake pancakes okay so i will be right back with you guys so that we can eat breakfast okay all right okay guys so we are back and we are ready to assemble our blueberry cheesecake pancakes okay we have our pancakes lovely brown edge light fluffy pancakes we have our philadelphia no-bake cheesecake filling and then we also have our homemade blueberry compote we have another recipe for that you guys should go check that out as well so now we're just going to we're going to stack them so what i will do is i will take a knife a butter knife for our cheesecake i'm going to take pancakes i'm going to lay one down i'm going to take some of our cheesecake filling look how soft and pliable that is it is like whip to perfection and it smells good too so i take that i'm gonna put a dollop of that right in the middle of our pancake now i'm going to take a little bit of our blueberry compote make sure you guys can see me see what we got going on okay i'm gonna take a little bit of the blueberry compo and a little bit of syrup and i'm gonna put that right in the middle too just lay it right down okay i'm gonna take another pancake do the same thing cheesecake filling just a little dollop just like that compote lay it right down another pancake another dollop a little bit more compost and our last pancakes just like that okay and i'm gonna move it over okay now for the top i am going to top with blueberry compote only for aesthetic purposes okay so i take a nice nice nice nice dollop of our compote and i'm going to put it right on the top just like that and i'm going to let it go where it may now i am going to try to help it to not topple over but i'm okay with some that fall off all right so that is where we are i actually had a little bit of a spill so i'm going to clean that up a little bit and i'm gonna try to go back into the pot and get a little bit more of the syrup okay syrup only if i can to get a drizzle nice drizzle coming off of the top of our pancake tower and i'm going to go back and get a little bit more one more time and i'm actually i'm running low on syrup honestly our um our liquid actually did reduce down to a really a really really nice syrup all right guys there you have it let me let me bring you guys in for a close-up couple close-ups let's see this angle is i think kind of the best look at that we have a blueberry cheesecake tower of pancakes made with our homemade blueberry compote which we do have a recipe for that that you guys can check out as well we had the the cheesecake again that's provided

notification bell when you subscribe so you get my latest videos and now let's get started yay say hello everybody always says the milah looks Moody but it's just his face he's actually very very happy dog oh you happy dog yeah jinsol food first we're going to make our base so I'm using some walnut halves and adding them into a bowl and these are organic and they are so so yummy then I'm gonna add my medjool dates you can use any dates you like I do like me Joel they're my favorite they're really thick and fatty and so sweet make sure you take out the seeds then we're gonna make our base so in a food processor add your walnuts with your dates and then add coconut shreds and I'm using unsweetened vanilla extract and just a tiny pinch of salt then we're gonna close the lid and list everything together for a couple of minutes until it's all combined and kind of becomes you will see like a crumb mixture when I take it out it needs to be quite sticky and it should all come together just like that when you press on it so that means it's ready take it off and you can use any container or shape form for this recipe I've posted some pictures with small ones and large cakes so just up to you just make sure you cling film the bottom of your pan and then add your base first and it's not a really thick base but it's quite nice and you know good ratio of your blueberry to your crust so spread it evenly and just using a spoon and press it down so it's nice and sticky and then place it in a freezer for 20 minutes or so while we make our blueberry filling right here you can see my organic cashew nuts which have been soaking overnight so I'm just gonna drain these now and then place them into your food processor we're making our second layer then add your maple syrup and then I'm using one lemon squeezed just the juice and add your blueberries you can also add more blueberries if you wish next I'm going to add vanilla powder which is actually from Madagascar which is amazing and you only need a tiny tiny pinch you can see it's all being processed together the whole vanilla stick into a powder which is amazing so just add that into your cheesecake mixture and then I'm using a coconut organic extra virgin oil and we don't need too much just you know a tablespoon a large one and I'm gonna melt it in a microwave until it's nice and melted just like that so then add this into your cheesecake mixture this will help our dessert to set and be nice and sort of stable and then I'm adding some coconut milk and this is the top of the can so just the fatty part again this will help to stabilize the dessert so just add all that and just bliss it again until it's nice and smooth my blender is you know quite strong but not the most powerful so I think I've listed for about five to six minutes until it becomes super super nice and smooth obviously the longer you blitz it the better will be then just take it off and pour your blueberry cheesecake mixture on top of your nutty date base then I decided to add more blueberries inside you don't have to do that just put them all inside and dip them into the Cheesecake so you can't see them so we're gonna hide the blueberry little surprise then shake your cake just to make sure there are no air bubbles at the bottom and place your cake into the freezer for a couple of hours and till it's nice and set guys and girls you can find my recipe on Ally's yummy food on my website it will be on a front page today and of course as I blowed new recipes the blog will update itself but you can also search for any recipes that you want and check out all the other delicious cakes and treats that I have on our website just click on a picture and you will have the full recipe with video directions next I decided to make a blueberry jam to complement the cake so add one cup of blueberries and one cup of sugar and we're going to cook this on low heat until the blueberry starts to soften this can take from five to eight minutes just keep mixing it together if you're using frozen blueberries do not add any water as there really contain quite a lot of water and then you can see the mixture starts to become nice and sort of smooth and beautiful in color just set this aside to cool down once your blueberry cheesecake is done take it out of the freezer and then gently using a sharp knife just loosen the edges and gently take out your mold from the cake then place it onto your presentation plate and I'm adding my blueberry jam right in the middle again you can spread it around all over the entire cake if you like use your imagination do whatever you like however you want it and then I'm adding more fresh blueberries on top and just filled raspberries just for a bit of color you can add some fresh mint here some strawberries anything that you like and there you go my blueberry blitz cheesecake is so delicious you can see they cuts through really nice and well it's not too hard it's quite a soft cake so it doesn't need a lot of time to defrost and afraid and then you can plate it I'm adding more blueberry jam onto each slice just like that and spread it around and guys this cake is to die for honestly it's so so delicious so fresh I do think that the blueberry jam adds the extra brut blueberry flavor and it goes through nice and well it's really creamy in the middle and really kind of nutty and crusty crunchy at the bottom this cake will definitely be a hit guys check out all my other videos and I'll see you soon [Music] [Applause]", "_PS4h8JYeVM": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Natasha Kravchuk of natashaskitchen.com. Today we're gonna make a basic cheesecake, said no one ever. This is by no means basic. This cheesecake is super\nimpressive, it's tall, it's kinda like a New\nYork style cheesecake. It's delicious, and it's\npretty easy to make. I think you'll be surprised. So let's go over the\ningredients real quick. You're gonna need about a a cup and a half of graham cracker crumbs. You're gonna need six\ntablespoons of unsalted butter. One tablespoon of regular sugar. Five eight ounce blocks of cream cheese, at room temperature, very important, to get those five sticks of\ncream cheese at room temp. A cup and a half of white sugar. Seven large eggs at room temperature also. A fourth of a cup of sour cream. And then a teaspoon and a\nhalf of vanilla extract. Alright, first things first. Preheat the oven to\n350 degrees fahrenheit. Then get started on melting your butter. So I got our butter nice and melted. And measure out your graham\ncracker crumbs, cup and a half. And your tablespoon of sugar. So go ahead and pour the\ngraham cracker crumbs right in to that butter and add the sugar. And we're just gonna mix it together, until all of the graham\ncrackers are moistened. Alright so what we're gonna do next, is transfer that to a spring form pan. This looks like a nine\ninch spring form pan, you see it's got that tall wall, and the base comes out, which is great for serving the cheesecake. I wouldn't recommend any other\nkind of pan besides this one. So just transfer your crumbs into he bottom of your spring form mold. And then even them out on the bottom. Now this part doesn't have to be perfect. You just want them to be pretty even. And when you're putting\nin the graham crackers, try and let them go up the wall, just a little bit, to make sure that we seal the edges, and we're not gonna be\ngetting cream cheese seeping through the bottom. And we're gonna pop this in the oven, for eight minutes at 350. Alright, the crust is\nready and it's perfect. So you wanna let that cool\ndown to room temperature. And in the meantime, crank your oven up to 450, and get started on your\ncream cheese filling. We're gonna start with our five sticks of softened cream cheese. Now, again, super super important that this is at room temperature, because if it's not, you can have clumps in your cheesecake, and we don't like clumps\nin our cheesecake, no. So put those in, and then add your cup and\na half of granulated sugar. And you're gonna mix that together, on about medium high\nspeed for five minutes, or until it's nice and fluffy. And scrape down the bowl as you need to so you don't get chunks of cream cheese. (whizzing) Alright, we're gonna scrape her down. Make sure there's no clumps. Okay and crank it back up to finish off that last five minutes, or the rest of the five minutes. Alright, five minutes later, you can see how nice and\nfluffy that cream cheese is. We're gonna kick it down to medium speed, and add your eggs one at a time, until they're nicely incorporated. (whizzing) And it's a good idea to go ahead and scrape down the bowl right now too, just so you don't get any globs of cream cheese on the sides, it's all well incorporated. So just scrape her down. (whizzing) Now we're gonna kick it down to low speed, and add your fourth of\na cup of sour cream, and your vanilla. And just keep mixing\nuntil it's well blended. (whizzing) We're ready to transfer\nthe filling into the crust. Yum, check that out. Woo, that looks perfect. So velvety smooth. It's huge. Look at this, it's\nfills up this whole pan. Smooth out the top with a spatula, and then you're gonna bake\nat 450 for 15 minutes, then turn down your heat to 225, and bake for another\nhour and five minutes. Now also super important, do not open your oven while it's in there, otherwise it's more likely to\nform the cracks on the top. Now this one, sometimes it still forms a little crack. But that's perfectly fine, because we have a\nblueberry topping coming, that's just fantastic. Once the cheesecake comes out of the oven, it's gonna be, oh yay tall. Maybe half an inch, sometimes\nan inch above the rim. Which is what it's supposed to do. And then as it cools, it sinks back down. So you want this to cool. Just take it out of the\noven when it's done, let it cool to room temperature\nin the refrigerator, or if it's cold in your garage, just pop it in the garage. Let it cool down all the way. And that's why I like making\nthis cake in the evening, is because it can really, you're not gonna eat it anyways so, why tease yourself all day? So first things first, we are going to take your knife and run it around the edges of the cheesecake. Just to loosen it from the pan. So that's what we're gonna do. Just run it around the edge. La-di-da. Okay. And then you can release the\nsides of your spring form mold. Ta-da. And then you're gonna take\na thin edge spatula like so, and just slide it under\nthe base of the cheesecake. You can just serve it right on the base of the spring form mold, and that's perfectly cool. So push it through along the edges, and then once you're done doing that, you can transfer it to a cake platter. Now be very careful, because the base of this, the cookie crust is very slippery. And when I made this\nfor Thanksgiving dinner, I have a disaster story. So I was carrying it to someone's house, and as soon as I got out of\nthe car, it just like (whoosh) right onto the floor. It was really a disaster. (laughs) True story. So just be careful, because this thing is kinda slippery. And what I love about the topping on this, is the border kinda create a bowl for that blueberry topping\nthat we're gonna make. So let's get working on that real quick. It's fast and it's easy you guys. You're gonna love this. So we start out with one\nfourth of a cup of water. Cold water. Two tablespoons of sugar. Two teaspoons of corn starch. And a tablespoon of lemon juice. And you're just gonna whisk that together. You wanna do this cold, not on the heat, because if you do it on the heat, that corn starch before it's\nmixed into the water real well, it'll start to turn jelly-like, and then you get chunks in your sauce. You don't want that. Alright, mix that together. Put that on the heat, over a medium heat. You see how it's starting to thicken? Let's go ahead and add in the four cups of frozen blueberries. Alright, and once those are in, you wanna just continue to mix it, until you see a light bubbling. You want to get rally hot, but you don't want it to boil, because if you boil blueberries, they kind turn to mush, and we want these to keep their form. Alright, that blueberry topping is done. And it's perfect. And you know, this is great, not just for cheesecake, but you can put this\non pancakes or waffles. It's delicious. Alright, now the important part, the taste test. So we're cutting big slices here. And there's two ways to serve this. You can, especially if you\nhave cracks on the top, which this one doesn't, it's perfect, but you can put the blueberries on top, and just make a topping out of it, or you can serve individual\nslices of cheesecake, on the plate, and then top each slice\nwith some blueberry sauce. And that's the way I like to do it. (upbeat music) Mm. This is delicious. Wow. I hope you guys love this recipe. It's definitely a family favorite.

i've been wanting to try a slightly healthier take on a no-bake cheesecake since i love the dessert so much and can be often found binging on it so i have lightened it with some greek yogurt but you will never be able to tell it still has that rich creamy delicious feel to it nothing like a low calorie treat i've also added some fresh blueberries that i had in my fridge but you know what you can add any fruit which you like or just keep it simply plain so let's get cooking to make the blueberry no-bake cheesecake first we set up the base and the base is generally made of a biscuit base what i normally do is i take digestive biscuits and actually crush them so what i have is basically a fine powder or digestive biscuits here instead of making a crumble which is made out of flour and butter i think it's very easy and it's better and faster to actually buy in a ready-made digestive biscuits custom into a food processor or with the rolling pin we just crush it and get a fine powder now if you want you can also add flavoring in this now so you can add cardamom powder you can add cinnamon clove powder you can add fennel seeds they all work well they give a very nice flavor but there's one trick i'm going to show you now is the color is quite light but i want a dark color because the cheesecake is going to be very creamy and white in color so i want a dark base to contrast so for that it's a very very simple technique all you do is basically put cocoa powder in them so get unsweetened cocoa so literally a heaped teaspoon of cocoa should do the trick you just or mix together the cocoa powder and the crumbs the biscuit crumbs and you can see the color is already taken on into a dark shade now this is quite loose right now if you put them into a base of a cake tin or into a mold to set it'll not really set well it'll break so when you cut the cheesecake it's going to actually break off so you need to bind it together so very much like a short crust pastry has to be crisp and the trick for that is by adding melted butter so you add in the melted butter into the cocoa powder and the biscuit crumb and just stir it together and it will become literally like a dough now you got to keep in mind that butter is basically fat and when you put them onto a layer of the cake tin and you set it in the fridge for some time the butter solidifies and becomes hard so what you would get at the base is a very nice thick layer or a crisp layer of base i mean you can use any kind of biscuit there if you want to use a dark brisket like an oreo even that would work well so just mix it together and see there you have it it is like a dough so this is ready and i'm going to now i have a caked in here any extra butter from i'm going to put it on the sides of the cake tin i'm greasing the sides and i have a greased butter paper on the base here so when i take out the cake near the end it'll come out quite easily then goes in my biscuit base [Music] now again the thickness of the base is entirely up to you i like to keep it quite thin if you like the dough part and you want to make it uh thicker you can always double up the quantity of the butter and the biscuits and make a thick base and then all you do is you spread that as at the base and make it smooth the biscuit has all been spread at the base very evenly you know this is now going to go into the fridge for approximately 20 to 25 minutes for the butter to harden and what you will get is a nice crisp dark biscuit layer at the base for the no-bake cheesecake we're going to use just soft cheese and i'm going to set the cheesecake with some thickener like a gelatin you can use agar agar it works perfectly fine normally when you do a cheesecake which is baked you add egg yolks in them and then you bake the whole thing in the oven and it works well which is indeed very nice but i find it very very heavy for the no-bake cheesecake you need to leave your soft cheese outside for a good 35-40 minutes from the fridge for it to come to room temperature and the reason for that is it then is easier to then whisk the cream together otherwise if it's cold cream cheese it does not mix well you see that it's been lying outside for a while and instantly as you whisk it it becomes nice and smooth and creamy now the base of this is cheese i am going to lighten it up and i'm going to use something very unusual you normally don't put into a cheesecake and that is actually yogurt but first i put in some green sugar i'm going to whisk the grain sugar and the cheese just want to melt the sugar basically [Music] the cheese is nice and smooth the sugar has melted you can see it's got a nice gloss because the sugar is melted into it and then i'm going to add yogurt you normally add just a cream into it but i am going to do a mixture of cream and a mixture of yogurt so it's going to be a little lighter but first let me just whisk the yogurt to make it smooth and then goes in the cream i'm using a whipping cream or you can use a cooking cream or a double cream use a thick cream is better the mixture is now ready it's nice and smooth and that's very important to note that all the stuff which goes into the cheesecake should be nice and smooth you don't want a grainy texture or coarse texture over the cheesecake the cold cheesecake should have a nice smooth texture the cream cheese yogurt sugar and cream all whisk together so it's got the sweetness into it now what i'm going to do i'm going to actually add berries in this i'm going to add blueberry the blueberry i think will give a very nice color it'll also give a very nice flavor to the dish and i'm going to reserve a little at the end and i'm going to use it as a garnish and we'll talk to you about that but first just fold this berries into the cheesecake and then i'm going to add in this my setting agent which is going to be gelatin take out all the extra stuff and get my gelatin organized to set the cheesecake i'm going to use jalen powder you can use gelatin leaves if you're using gelatin leaves you've got to soak them into cold water for them to balloon and then melt them down and add to cheesecake i just find that when you use a powder it's a lot easier you can also use agar agar which works perfectly fine so warm water and gelatin and you just whisk it together till the gelatin melts here we have gelatin is melted it's nice and smooth and you need to put it straight away inside the cheesecake if you let it rest for a while on its own it will become quite hard and then again you're going to warm it up maybe in the microwave and again liquidify and then add it so best is to at this stage is to pour the gelatin when it is still slightly warm and all you do is you mix together the gelatin with the cheesecake mixture and because it is slightly warm the cheese softens up further but that is perfectly okay it's not going to split it's not really hot just form a smooth mixture you see that [Music] the gelatin has to spread into the cheesecake mix there we are this cheesecake blueberry set let's get in our cake tin with the biscuit base and you can see it is nice and firm at the moment it's really hard and the butter become hard and all you have to do is now just pour the blueberry cheesecake on top of the biscuit base [Music] spread it across [Music] i'm going to lightly tap cheesecake mixture and that is now ready to go in the fridge for another 30 minutes to solidify and then set to be served there are many ways to garnish your cheesecake you can add chocolate chips you can make chocolate flowers you can make chocolate strands you can do shorter chocolate you can make tui you can do spun sugar there are many many variations you can do but for a very simple use i'm going to show you how to do a little bit of a blueberry which you can slightly transform in a very simple manner you could probably make it into a or a puree and you can sprinkle it that will also work well but a very simple is way to enhance a very simple dish and keep it very rustic it literally by cutting your blueberries into half and adding a tiny quantity of icing sugar yes just plain simple icing sugar and all you do is you lightly toss them together and you gently crush them slightly now what happens when you crush them very gently they begin to release their flavors and their color of the blueberry which is actually very nice and this can just go like a little like a soft like a salsa or like a fruit salad kind of a topping on top of the cheesecake very simple very good effect to have on to your cheesecake and also very nice flavor so i'm going to let that rest for 8 to 10 minutes at room temperature and once the cheesecake is set we're going to slice it into a wedge and maybe into a rectangle i'm not sure how i'll do it but we'll make it interesting there you are cheesecake is now ready i'm going to demold it and there's a little trick i'm going to teach you how to get it out very easily i've got a high caked in or smaller in diameter than this one here the best is to just keep this on the board or the table and you put your cake tin with the cheesecake and just press it down instead of lifting it up it's a problem so just press it down and voila there you have the cheesecake is now removed off it goes and now i'm going to take it off from the bottom and then slice it and have a nice veg of my no bake blueberry cheesecake the cheesecake is done i'm going to get a nice wedge so wipe off the extra get a nice clean [Music] wedge oh the sound of the cutting of the cheesecake the brace is so nice you can wipe it off and let's have a look [Music] there you have and then it goes on to the plate now the cheesecake is so delicate the flavors are so balanced and simple and you don't need much to go classically a cheesecake should be has on its own i'm going to only add on top of that is my blueberries the final garnishes are going to be my blueberries which were lightly dusted with the icy sugar and they also have released their own juices which is quite nice [Music] i'm going to put one more piece and that is it and lastly the little garnish of silver leaf and that's about it so here you have my no bake cheesecake flavored with blueberries and the base has got biscuit with cacao powder simple dish elegant but lots of flavor do try it at home make it for your friends and family and don't forget to leave your comments on the section below until next time bon appetit and happy [Music] cooking [Music] you", "hjUdS8Ew0mk": "okay guys to get started with our lemon blueberry cheesecake I have a cup and a half of graham cracker crumbs and to that I'm just gonna add one tablespoon of white sugar and I'm gonna give that a good mix [Music] try to just get it done spread out as evenly as you can and then I have a quarter cup of melted butter give them a quick stir [Music] you're looking for the consistency of Kombucha damp or wet sand pretty much all my cheesecakes have a cookie or a graham cracker crust that consists of the exact same measurements a cup and a half of whatever crumbs you decide a tablespoon or two of sugar depending on what your crust is and a quarter cup of butter then I have my 9-inch springform pan here and I'm just gonna dump out the crumbs and I didn't get them mixed up completely that's okay they're gonna get kind of mixed into each other when I spread them out and then I find taking a cup a mug something with kind of a flat surface bottom and just kind of squishing the graham cracker crumbs out to the middle or out from the middle to the sides I don't go all the way up on the sides it's kind of however many I have whatever it will allow that's not my main concern here [Music] alright once you're happy with that I'm going to preheat my oven to 350 degrees and I'm gonna pop this in once it's preheated for 10 minutes and then I'll take it out and I'll bring you back for the next step all right guys while my crust is cooking in the oven the next step we have is our blueberry filling I guess it's almost in fact is kind of just like a blueberry pie filling only kind of not so much I have 1 cup of blueberries fresh I prefer fresh but if all you have is frozen I won't uh I won't judge you for it but they are washed and drained and dried to that I have 5 tablespoons of cornstarch and we're just going to kind of it always wants to cling to the bottom of the bowl just going to kind of mix those around this will help thicken to that I'm going to add two tablespoons of lemon juice all right maybe a little more and I'm going to turn on my heat kind of a medium-high heat or even just a high heat and I'm just gonna start squishing my blueberries with a potato masher I don't want them too awfully mashed cuz I kind of like to bite into a berry once in a while and they will for sure cook down and get softer and easier to mash I promise just kind of stir it as the heat starts to warm your pot or your saucepan [Music] start turning that beautiful blue and purple color to this I'm going to add I know it sounds like a lot if you're watching categories this is probably not the Cheesecake for you but I have a cup and a half of sugar [Music] and we're just gonna start stirring that around the sugar will actually dissolve and make the sauce a little less I guess a little more loose and then it will all cook down and it's gonna taste delicious in fact if you want to stop right now and just put this over ice cream I would be okay with that it is delicious my husband I actually made this cheesecake for my gonna put into a birthday I was trying alright this is a medium to high heat I'm going to basically babysit this because we want it to thicken up we want those blueberries to open up and it will eventually be similar to a blueberry pie filling but unfortunately that's gonna take about five to 10 minutes so I will bring you back when this has reached the consistency that I'm happy with okay guys we are at what's called a roaring void rolling boil means basically it cannot be stirred down I'm gonna reduce my heat by about half we'll put it on well maybe just low I kind of got to watch it because it will boil over you can kind of see over here mine did pop a little bit and go overboard and at this point you just want to let it simmer low once you can find that perfect temperature on your stove where it's still cooking however it's not boiling over and I think we're kind of cooling down enough now where it is it's gonna get very very thick almost like well like I said it's pretty much pie filling this stuff is great on blueberry pancakes waffles ice cream it's delicious but we're gonna use it for our blueberry cheesecake all right we're gonna want to let this pretty much simmer for ten minutes so I'm gonna let this hang out stirring occasionally we want to watch it babysit it so it doesn't boil over but let it just kind of hang out and simmer for about ten minutes and I will bring you back to assemble the cheesecake part of this okay guys we're back my crust is finished in the oven and I'm just gonna set that aside my blueberry sauce has finished cooking it's reduced and gotten quite sticky as you can see it kind of sticks right to my spatula here and it should kind of form like when you drag it it'll like kind of create a divot and hold that divot that's kind of when you know that you are done it's quite sticky and quite delicious I'm just gonna set that aside let that hang out whoops and we're gonna get ready to make the cheesecake portion of our lemon blueberry cheesecake to start off with I have four bricks of cream cheese softened and to room temperature I have one and a quarter cup of white sugar and at this point I am just going to cream together my cream cheese and my sugar I like to do this step simply because I feel like all of the lumps kind of get mixed out of the cream cheese because I when I first started making cheesecakes in the past I would always end up with lumpy cheesecakes ever since then I I really beat the heck out of my cream cheese make sure it's smooth and therefore I get no long in my cheesecake so I'm gonna kind of speed this process up because it's quite noisy and I don't want you guys to have to listen to all that [Music] all right all of the lumps have been beaten out of my cream cheese I add my sugar I have three tablespoons of cornstarch it never wants to there we go I have a cup and a half of sour cream [Music] this I think just adds to the richness and the decadence of the Cheesecake and then I have two teaspoons of vanilla of course I don't have my teaspoon measure so I'm just going to eyeball it and then I'm going to add two tablespoons of lemon extract I know it sounds like a lot but I really love the lemon flavor in fact if you like you tart lemon I might even go ahead and end three but for this I'm just gonna add two [Music] and then I'm going to add two teaspoons of lemon juice whoo well there we go and then I'm gonna go ahead mix this really really well and then we'll add our aides okay my cheesecake blend has mixed really well all of my eggs need to be added a one at a time so it is three whole eggs and one egg yolk but you need to add it mix it add it mix it don't ask me why but this formula works and I'm not going to mess with us with with what works so I will speed that process up but just remember to add them one at a time okay it is now time to assemble all of our delicious parts of our cheesecake I have my crust which I've already baked and then I'm going to add almost all of our cheesecake filling but not quite all I'll show you why here in just a minute [Music] all right I reserved all maybe just under a quarter spread that out as evenly as you can [Music] it's okay if it gets a little messy just Bowl out of my way here we go [Music] all right now I've got my blueberry sauce over here and I let this cool a little bit it's not quite as hot you don't want it scalding hot simply because it'll start cooking the eggs too soon in the Cheesecake so let it kind of hang out a little bit get cool I have a spoon just a super cereal spoon and I'm just going to kind of dollop every so often some of our blueberry mixture I don't think we'll use all I didn't last time but guess what the leftovers are amazing on pancakes or ice cream or [Music] if you want to put some additional on it when you go to serve it that would work too all right now I've just got a plain butter knife and I'm just gonna try to get that swirled in to the cheesecake filling as best I can [Music] I want to mix it I just want to swirl it so it's not a ton of blueberries with every bite but just enough [Music] okay as far as baking times I'm going to preheat my oven to 350 I'm going to put this in the oven in my water bath for 15 minutes I'm gonna turn it down to 325 degrees for one hour in 25 minutes once that stir cooking time is up I'm gonna turn off my oven and I'm gonna let it rest for an hour in the oven now once it's out of the oven at that point we like put it on the counter let it come up to room temperature completely and then we're gonna store it in the refrigerator I like to store it overnight but 6 to 8 hours should be sufficient but I will out bring you back when it comes out of the oven and just to show you and hopefully there's no cracks I'm guessing that it's gonna crack here but you know it can't be helped I am NOT a professional cook I just like what I like alright I will bring you back when it is out of the oven alright guys my cheesecake has finished baking in the oven now I will admit I did leave mine in after I turned my oven off a little bit too long I got distracted by my adorable niece on FaceTime and I guess the alarm didn't go off for some reason I set it on my phone but I don't know I either I didn't hear it maybe I hit ignore I don't know she's cute the top of cheese kicks a little brown I'm happy with it time well-spent I'm just taking a butter knife and kind of running it along the edges so that way as the cheese cake cools because the pan is still quite warm in the middle of the cake is very hot yet as it cools it'll want to like pull away from the sides of the springform pan and when it does it might crack and so we don't want that so I'm just running a butter knife a lot edge and so that way as the cools it's already been separated from oh the outer ring of the the 9-inch pan at this point I'm just gonna let this guy cool now right here whoo that is still pretty hot I'm gonna let it cool out cool on the top of my oven I've just put a dish towel under it it's it's the stovetop is completely safe to put it on it's made for high temperatures I don't know for us to have it it's gonna hang out probably a couple hours until it's completely cooled to the touch and then once it's cooled I will put the rub pan and all right into the refrigerator and I'm gonna let it hang out overnight in there and tomorrow morning I will get the camera out and I will show you how I'm gonna finish off our lemon blueberry cheesecake but as of right now this is smelling wonderful so I will see you tomorrow then all right guys it's the next morning my cheesecake is chilling in the refrigerator but right now we're gonna make a white chocolate lemon ganache I have 1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream that I have just popped in the microwave for 45 seconds and to that I'm going to add one cup of white chocolate chips [Music] and I'm just going to stir it around just a little bit to kind of get it covered white-chocolate does not melt at the same consistency or temperature or rate as regular brown chocolate does and that's why I'm not using a a saucepan to melt my white chocolate I'm just going to stir it around try to get all of the white chocolate melted if I find that the cream is cooling off too quickly I'm just gonna pop it back in the microwave with the chocolate in it for about 20 more seconds watching it very very closely this is quite a mess to clean up in the microwave so please treat this with kit gloves just kind of stirring it all right guys one thing I should mention before we let it cool for about five minutes the chocolate is at the consistency that I'm looking for it's kind of like thick soup I'm going to add one tablespoon of pure vanilla extract [Music] and give that a good stir try to get all that extract combined with the chocolate this is delicious the first time I made this I made a little too much and that was a very happy accident we like having leftovers all right once that's combined well now I'm gonna let it sit for about five five to 10 minutes and then we will get our cheesecake out of the refrigerator and pour this stuff right on top all right I'll be back for that part well that's life now I've got my cheesecake on my serving platter that I plan on serving it on I'm just gonna gently drizzle my ganache on top I don't want this to pour over the sides a whole lot because it just ends up making one giant mess at the bottom of the serving dish I'm just gonna kind of pour it start from the middle and kind of gently let it kind of work itself out to the sides and I'll add more if I feel like it needs more but if it doesn't I'm not gonna put more than needs to be on top the little drizzles over that's fine mmm I'm not gonna be upset at that but I don't want a ton just kind of pulling at the bottom of my cake stand kind of what happened last time [Laughter] just kind of helping it work [Music] all right I'm happy with this I'm gonna let this hang out just like it is for about oh maybe 10 15 minutes and then I'm just gonna pop it in the refrigerator and then I'll bring you back I'm just gonna put some blueberries on top and I think it's it's a simple look but I think it's a good look so I will bring you back when I'm ready to put my blueberries on I did pop it in the fridge for about Oh 10 more minutes at this point I really the first time I made this I went all out and tried to do something very elegant on the top and it didn't turn out I think more like a rustic look is good here I have literally just the rest of my blueberries leftover washed and dried and I'm just I'm literally just gonna sprinkle some on top and I think the simplicity of it looks better than trying to do something fancy here everyone's gonna realize that there's blueberries in the cheesecake they're gonna smell it cuz I can smell it in that lemon is just very potent but in a very good way I love lemon if you like lemon your I love this cheesecake and I kind of like being able to bite into a whole blueberry in the contrast between that sweet blueberry and kind of the tart lemon is in my opinion a perfect combination it's like they were made for each other [Music] and there you have it that is my lemon and blueberry cheesecake I'm really really really hope you guys give it a try I think it's one of my better cheesecakes lemon is my all-time favorite flavor if I'm gonna pick between a lemon dessert and a chocolate dessert it's always gonna be lemon I get a rogue blueberry there we go if you guys liked today's video please give me a thumbs up and if you like what I do here please consider hitting that subscribe button so you don't miss out on any future videos I'll see you in the next one guys [Music] you", "qs6oFC6KXZ0": "[Music] what's going on everybody welcome back today I'm gonna provide you and your taste by cream with a dessert that combines two of my favorite things french toast and cheesecake to create a new berry styled cheesecake french toast let's get on with the recipe here we go this pot I'm adding blueberries water lemon juice sugar and of course cornstarch you know cornstarch is a funny thing that's used in so many ways for this part of the recipe it's used to thicken the juice it's leftover from heating up the blueberries the natural pectin of the blueberries combined with the lemon juice will thicken it but I'm looking for a pie filling consistency for the base of the cheese caper mixture I'm using whipped cream to give it some airiness so that you can consume more without feeling heavy and the thing about this mixture is that it's very important to introduce the whipped cream to the sugar and cream cheese mixture so that at first all the whipped cream doesn't break down and second you have to treat the ingredients like a blind date you want to warm them up to one another before they go on for the second date and before birthing some sort of delicious recipe for the base of the french toast and trying to achieve a and crust now what I mean is I want to add an effect of a pie crust but in french toast form to this dish I'm whisking up some eggs and adding some cream to the other dish I'm using some crushed up graham crackers now crushed up graham crackers have sugar in it and that alone will give me the crust that I want to represent a classic cheesecake pie crust in order to make sure the natural sugars in the graham don't burn dry each side for about two minutes or until it starts to change color ever so slightly when playing this dish it's important to make sure the fresh toast layers are fully cooled to room temperature otherwise when adding the cream cheese filling it might melt and ruin the entire thing this recipe is for two slices of french toast which is more than enough the fact that I'm using three layers in this video is purely for effect and because I was hungry that day [Music] are you serious look at this ridiculous creation whipped cream mixed with some cream cheese and sugar to provide that awesome cheesecake layer I use crushed graham crackers to coat this thick cut Texas toast to create a graham cracker crust french toast which basically acts as the crust of a traditional cheesecake and for the topping I created a super easy four ingredients blueberry pie filling guys look at this thing it's insane it smells delicious but what does that mean to you it doesn't mean anything because I need to taste it and explain the taste exploded this is crazy it's full of cheesecake and french toast the cream cheese mixed with the whipped cream and powdered sugar gives you that tartness that you know and love from every cheesecake and on top you got some blueberry pie filling that is so incredibly easy to make hope you guys like this video I hope that one day you could try and recreate this recipe if you want the instructions click the link down

      ", "GZK48HOaVBI": "hey guys I'm going to make my no-bake blueberry cheesecake bars today we're taking him to a barbecue my in-laws house so I thought I'd show you how I make them since they're so simple and this is all you're going to need for the crust you'll need a little bit of sugar a bunch of graham crackers crushed you can use your food processor but I'm just going to use my nutribullet because I'm lazy and then I'm going to melt one stick of butter and I'm going to grind it all up in the nutribullet and then press it down into in where a baking pan okay that was not as easy as I thought it would be with the nutribullet so I won't do that again but I'm just going to dump it all out into this pan and press it in it needs more the nutribullet is meant to have liquid so that's why it was a little bit tougher instead of just having a little bit of that butter which isn't solid or liquid enf but anyway so use your food processor or stick it all in a bag and crush it with like a can or a rolling pin and it'll work out just fine yeah okay I just broke up some of larger pieces that didn't break up with my fingers and I'm just going to press it down and it'll make a nice thick crust because this is just a 2 quart baking pan and 8 by 8 inch pan so if there's a couple of like bigger chunks of it doesn't matter because it's the crust so I'm just going to smooth this out and get to making my blueberry sauce and I'm just going to make my blueberry sauce recipe I have that recipe on my blog we use it for waffles or pancakes or anything like that and it's perfect for this as a topping on this cause I'm going to make the filling the cream cheese filling and then the blueberry sauce you just want to kind of get this sort of evenly smashed out mashed out okay now for the filling you're going to need two packs of 8 ounce cream cheeses of 16 ounce of cream cheese about a cup of powdered sugar and then coot 2 cups of heavy whipping cream or a pint and then I like to add a dash of vanilla so I'd say depending on how much you like vanilla maybe about a teaspoon or a little bit more and you're just going to whip and I also add a squeeze of lemon juice I always add lemon juice to whatever cheesecake I'm making because I find it we like the flavor and I find it just cuts the sweetness for me of it and I'll show you how I do it right now all right so you want to start with the cream cheese two 8-ounce blocks and then the powdered sugar you want those to blend first before you add the cream if I can over open this you want the cream cheese to mix with the powdered sugar first and it's just a cup of powdered sugar and start slow because sometimes I forget and I go fast and my stuff goes everywhere see and I'm going to mix that I'll be right back so now I'm going to add the two cups of heavy whipping cream and a dash of vanilla and again just do vanilla to taste I would say maybe about a teaspoon we love vanilla so I tend to overdo it with vanilla sometimes and you're just going to mix it on you don't want to mix it as fast this time around so I'm going to pour that in there I should probably open this up doesn't that look pretty get in there cheese okay and then my dash of vanilla sometimes I just use the cap as my measurement which is why I have vanilla dried all around the cap just a dash of that and then I'm going to do my squeeze of lemon I'm using just a Meyer lemon because that's what I have for my tree use whatever you have probably about a good tablespoon is what I use okay and I mix that up again on much lower speed so I turned it to medium-high after it kind of thickened a little bit so that it doesn't slosh right out of the mixer and it's going to get it's going to get much thicker than it was to start with so don't stress out in the beginning case you've never made this foot with something like this before so it's already I don't know if you can tell it's already much thicker now so I'm going to let that go for another minute or so so then when I pour into the crust it's not going to be really soupy okay and then I just while I wasn't filming I squeezed about another tablespoon of lemon juice in there fresh lemon juice because I tasted it and it was not quite as tart as I like it okay it is nice and thick as you'll see see how it's now stiff and I'm going to pour this right into the pan and an even layer I'm going to cover it and refrigerate it for about two hours or actually I'm probably gonna refrigerate it just until before we're leaving and I'm going to go ahead and make the blueberry sauce let that cool and refrigerate it and pour the blueberry sauce on before we leave just so it has time to also set up a little bit as well you can pour it on individually if you like on individual slices but I like it like this and I think it looks pretty when we put it on a whole square pan all right ooh I want to eat that somebody lead it much you do want to lick this silence is nobody around Munchie do you want to lick this cream cheese cake stuff hi peachy okay I just kind of can you see watch the bowl down and I'm just going to dump it in here and spread it out evenly sorry for this hand shop but you'll see how it's like and the bars aren't meant to be like super stiff tooth cake you know sometimes you can get a cheesecake that's super firm it's not supposed to be like that it is a softer bar type it does set up more but it don't look for it to be completely hard because it's not going to get there so just evenly smash that out mash that out see how high it is it's really thick so these bars you might think like Oh bars not enough like with Cheesecake you don't really need huge slice I mean go ahead and have at it if you want but you don't need huge slices okay so there's there will be one two three four five six of us well five and a little one today and this is enough for everyone it's more than enough okay and I'm going to cover this and refrigerate it for two hours okay guys so for the blueberry sauce all I've done so far as I turned it on to like medium medium high to get the blueberries to simmer so I have the blueberries the sugar which is about three tablespoons of sugar you can add more if you like it sweeter and lemon juice so I'm bringing it to a boil and then I'll turn it down to simmer and then once they still sort of start to pop and create their own juices and I like it a little thick anyway so I like them to be I let this sauce to be slightly chunky so you have like the bits of blueberry but then once they simmer you're going to mix the cornstarch which is one and a half teaspoons of cornstarch together with two tablespoons of cold water and add that to the berries and mix it gently together and then you're going to add the vanilla at the end and simmer for an additional couple of minutes so you'll start to see it'll start to sort of get you know more soft like so it's been about a minute and I can actually when I start to stir I kind of like to stir it along as you stir you'll hear some of them start popping from the heat and so I'm just going to do that for another couple minutes okay now it's been about two more minutes do you see how it's become really like a saucy a bunch of them have popped open and release the juices and so I added the cornstarch water and vanilla and I'm going to let this simmer for about two or three more minutes and I'm going to stir it give it a stir now and then as well and scrape down the sides it's already taste tested it it's so good alright so I'm going to turn it off now it's simmered for another two or three minutes and it's going to thicken I'm just going to take it off the burner and let it cool and then once it's cooled a bit I'll stick it in a bowl into the fridge to refrigerate until it's time to take the cheese take over to my in-laws and saw pour it on top and keep it refrigerated over there until we eat it you", "B90i1PNQypQ": "hi guys welcome back to CJ's kado kitchen tonight we are beginning our four week series on holiday baking cooking holiday recipes that you will be able to enjoy with your friends and family and you can also take them to gatherings or work parties wherever you need any kind of festive dish and sometimes with this lifestyle it can be difficult to find things that keep with the season so that you can feel included and so that's what our goal is with this four week series so tonight we are going to start off our series with blueberry cheesecake and this is a little carb ketogenic and sugar-free so it would be also good if you were diabetic or had any other reason why you needed to avoid sugar let's go ahead and get started so with this cheesecake there are several options that you can consider you can do different berries you can also do cranberries when they're in season and you would treat them just like the blueberries you would cook them sweeten them and puree them also you could do raspberries or strawberries so it's very versatile you can also change your springform sizes I'm using an 8-inch pan tonight but you could also use a 10-inch if you wanted a slightly smaller profile my profiles gonna be quite thick on my cheesecake but that's a personal preference you could also use a pie pan so you wouldn't need to use this break form pan at all although they are readily available now and pretty cost effective the other thing I changed with the original recipe is that it required very little sweetener in the actual Cheesecake batter and CJ and I like our cheesecake a little bit sweeter than that so you can also adjust the sweetener within your cheesecake batter so those are some things that might be a little different but I'm also going to walk through those steps and they'll also be notated in the P and in the description bar so come along and let's get started making this cheesecake so to start our cheesecake we need to prepare a springform pan and I'm using an 8-inch pan and I have cut a piece of parchment paper to put in the bottom and I have also greased it with a little bit of coconut oil spray so it's ready to go you also need to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees so the first step we're going to make our crust and that begins with a cup and 3/4 of almond flour and I'm using blanched and to this I want to get the lumps out a little bit because almond flour can be a little bit lumpy so to this mixture I want to add about one and a half tablespoons of sweetener and I'm using monk fruit and your throat all blend and I'm using the granular and then I'm also going to add a couple of shakes of ground cinnamon just to give the crust a little bit of flavor and I'm just gonna stir that all around in my bowl and this is just going to be reducing source ready for us or our cheesecake and to make I'm going to add one stick of melted butter and so that is 1/2 a cup but it's one stick and I'm just all together so that we can press it into the bottom of our springform pan our cheesecake pan and you would not have to have a springform pan for this if you did not want one you could do this easily do this in a pie pan okay I'm going to take our springform pan so I'm just gonna dump this into our springform pan and I'm just gonna take my clean hand and warp it in there holding onto my parchment paper so that it stays where I want it to the parchment is just going to help us remove the crust from the springform pan when it's time and it's not really essential that the crust go too far up the pan because our cheesecake is going to to form you know the lip the actual back of the cheesecake will be cheesecake not crust so we don't need to take it up too far just a little bit up the sides you just want to make it as even as you can you can use a spoon - that helps just even your crust so we are going to put this in the oven and bake it for about 10 minutes and just kind of let it set up a little bit before we add our cream cheese mixture into it so I'm going to put this into the oven and I'll be right back our next step why our crust is pre cooking a little bit I am taking four packages of Philadelphia Cream Cheese and I have let this sit out for multiple hours because you really want your cream cheese to be as softened as you possibly can have it be it's going to incorporate so much better if you let it sit out at room temperature as well as the eggs I have brought mine to room temperature in some warm water for about 15 minutes so if you don't remember to get your eggs out and let them sit you can bring them to room temperature with some warm water so I'm going to start mixing up this cream cheese and just getting them all incorporated then you want to start out slowly so you can see our cream cheese is nice and soft and creamy and that's what we want I'm going to add a little bit of bourbon vanilla just about a capful at this point I also want to add my sweetener and I'm going to be using the powdered your risk for tall blend and I just find that powdered products incorporate into baked goods a little bit easier than the granular so if you don't have powdered you can always roll it in your food processor or your mini bullet or whatever you use to make it more of a powdered consistency but I'm going to be putting a half a cup in and we're just going to combine this into our cream cheese mixture okay I'm going to scrape my bowl just to make sure that I got all of the sweetener off the bottom and now we are going to add our eggs and we're going to do them one at a time and let each one get incorporated before I add the second one the first one in blue we got a double yolk that's a good look okay so that first egg is well incorporated now we can add our second one today okay our mixture is nicely incorporated and very creamy as you can see and that is the consistency that we are looking for all right let's get our crust out and check on it and we're not looking for a lot of doneness we are going to continue to cook this but see it is a little bit brown on the edges which is nice because then it's not going to get doughy it smells nice and feminine okay so we have our cheesecake batter ready now we need to prepare our blueberries so I have blueberries here and I'm going to put about a cup of them into my mini processor and these were frozen and I've let them thaw because we're going to swirl that on the top of our cheesecake we want these to be stopped so if you buy frozen which this time of year is more than likely you need to let them either thaw or put them in the microwave because you won't be able to swirl as well if the blueberries are in a frozen state so I'm going to put half of these blueberries in my mini processor you want about a cup sort and I'm going to sweeten these just a little bit with some monk fruit erythritol they're pretty sweet on their own but I'm just going to sweeten them a little bit so about a tablespoon [Music] so we've just pureed them they still have some texture I'll show you there's still blueberry texture in there it's just going to help us swirl a little bit okay so what bring our crust over here so we can start some wings okay so we want to put our cheesecake filling into our springform pan it's nice and creamy just just bread that all around and now we're gonna take our little berry mixture and just drop it intermittently on the surface of our cheesecake and then I'm going to take a knife and start swirling doesn't you know have to be super difficult you just kind of want to play with it this is your chance to be artistic you can create a masterpiece here how does that look does it look swirly and blueberry ish you could do this with other types of berries blueberries aren't your thing also because this is a holiday themed series if you wanted to do cranberries when we get a little closer to cranberry season closer to actual Thanksgiving you could also use frozen cranberries in this it would be very beautiful also it would make a very pretty red cheesecake so we are going to put this into our 350 degree oven and we're going to cook it for at least 40 minutes you don't want it to get too Brown on top but you want it to be mostly set it can still be just a tiny bit jiggly in the center because it's going to finish solidifying because we need to refrigerate this for at least two hours but preferably overnight so we're going back into our oven for at least 40 minutes but keep an eye on it you still jewelry gasket strictly we can it can't be that jiggly yeah so it still has just a slight amount of give which is fine you want that it's going to solidify when it cools for your two hours in the refrigerator or overnight because if you let it keep going then you risk getting the top to brown and it's also going to shrink down as it cools so it won't be quite this full so I ended up taking this for another 15 minutes but I turned the temperature down to 300 and instead of 350 so that's just something you can do if you want it to continue cooking if you were still getting too much jiggle you can always take the temperature down a little bit and and let it go 10 15 more minutes it all also depends on if you decide to make this in a pie plate or if you make a bigger springform and so you won't have quite as thick of a lip on it you can adjust your temperature in that way cuz it might cook faster because it's more spread out I ended up doing mine in an 8 inch so I'll have a thicker lip on my cheesecake so then consequently it takes a little longer to cook it because it's thicker it looks awful pretty so it's the next day and I want to show you what our finished cheesecake looks like you can see that it has shrunk down quite a bit which is what it's supposed to do so when I open up my springform pan if you want to take a knife and run it along in between which I've already done just to make sure that it's all loosened from the sides of the springform pan but you can see that it's very thick and has made a nice lip for our cheesecake which is what we wanted it to do and the top is all settled so now we're going to cut into it and serve and CJ's gonna do a taste test hi CJ hi welcome to our four week holiday recipe series you know taste tester extraordinaire oh I know that you have already tasted the batter for this delicious blueberry swirl cheesecake yes yes so the batter is good and lets the cheese taste so this is our blueberry swirl cheesecake that's what we'll call it right here tonight it may change really creamy really cheesecake II that's super sweet so that might be

"m_7qvjVj5Q0": "what is up guys welcome back to the channel welcome back to my kitchen as most of you know we make a variety of meals on this channel some are hearty like the spaghetti we just made the chili dogs the chicken sandwiches but there's a percentage of my audience that only shows up when we're making dessert not sure what that says about you but i'm not judging personally if i'm looking to indulge just a little bit a nice baked good like a cookie a slice of cake a moff fern really hits the spot but the problem with those things is that they're loaded with sugar you can't have just one because that sugar kicks in a craving you have the whole entire plate and three there's no protein and they helping us stay anabolic helping us stay lean or helping us towards our goals but today ladies and gentlemen we're gonna change that in this video we'll be making anabolic blueberry cheesecake muffins delicious little protein packed muffins filled with a nice cheesecake center this recipe is wicked simple takes minimal ingredients and minimal time to prepare so next time that sweets craving comes in knocking on your front door yank that son of a gun open and this is sparta kick him out into the street cause i'm telling you this recipe just might change your life and as always if you got that rjf anabolic cookbook link in my description it's been updated this recipe's in there along with every other one of my super simple anabolic recipes if you're tired of doing a diet for 8 or 12 weeks maybe making some progress but ultimately falling off because it wasn't sustainable then i'm telling you this is your best shot man long-term success eating foods you love just making the better choices you get it one time to get every future recipe for free so if you guys are ready to get another epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Music] we'll start this off with a little physique update i like to do these accountability checks because you guys know especially if i'm on instagram that this is how i'm eating every day right and people are just waiting on me to get fat they don't think you can eat bread you can eat these recipes and maintain a lean physique so i'm here to prove all of them wrong boom no pump this is just me chilling man 2500 calories a day eating foods that i love i always tell y'all man how can you lose when we're eating like this i mean come on the results don't lie anyways let's get to these muffins first thing we're going to do is get a food scale and set a mixing bowl on top of it and the first thing we need is 66 grams of this martha white blueberry cheesecake muffin mix these are like 88 cents and they have them at every grocery that i go to so i always buy a few of them and keep them on hand just gonna dump it in here weigh it out and watch that scale next up we're gonna add about 31 grams of a vanilla based whey protein powder i'm using that final boss cinnamon toast swirl we just had a full restock on the site so we wanted to try it go check it out ends up being about one scoop and then next up we need about 170 grams of greek yogurt non-fat plain this is my favorite brand currently if you add a flavored brand to it just keep in mind it's going to add a little bit of sugar and affect the overall flavor we keep it plain that's going to keep it more anabolic now we need 112 grams of fat-free cream cheese and in a lot of recipes i'd sell you to let it get to room temperature because it mixes better but we don't got to do that here because as we mix this up it's going to create a bunch of little mini cheesecake pockets so when these cook it's going to leave gooey centery pieces and a lot of these muffins man just you wait ramble get you right and then finally all we need is five grams of zero calorie sweetener i prefer sucralose personally and then three grams of baking powder just to help it rise and boom and this is all of our ingredients in a bowl told you guys this was easy now let's get you a spoon go in and mix everything up until it's all combined you can break that fat-free cream cheese up a little bit if you want but don't worry about getting it fully incorporated because having those little chunks of it is what's gonna give these their creamy bursts [Music] once our batter is all mixed up we'll just grab a mini muffin tray and honestly you can make as many muffins as you want i like to do with this recipe about 16. let's hit it with non-stick then we'll just take our batter and slowly spoon it into every one of these molds until they're all filled up now all we got to do is throw these in the oven on 400 degrees for about 10 minutes quick easy anabolic let's go whoop whoop and ladies and gentlemen when i return it's anabolic cheesecake muffin time let's go and boom after just 10 minutes our blueberry cheesecake muffins are ready to go take a look at that man it's nice it's soft loaded with blueberries and let me show you the best part so if i just cut this right down the middle and we just open it up can you see that gooey center that's those little cream cheese pockets i'm talking about man look at that gooey creamy protein filled muffins man you really can't lose with a recipe like this especially when i tell you how many calories and macros is in this thing so if you made it this far into the video guys smash that thumbs up button for me subscribe if you're not subscribed and ladies and gentlemen i think it's time to pull up a chair strap on the old feet bag and try these things together you guys ready let's go all right boys and girls let's get this show on the road i'm saving so hard not to eat these before we got here but we made it one final thing to do finally man we've been out of stock on like everything forever i'm final boss finally got our aminos back in man the atomic bomb sickle so this might be the last can on earth as of like three hours ago when we restock so good stuff man a little bit of caffeine you can mix it with your water two scoops flavors a gallon you know what it is don't even gotta chase that one available at finalbossformats.com could already have ten ten percent so we're just going to hop in here with one of the ones we cut in half ma'am you guys should be able to see that man that little cheesecake blast right in the middle that's what makes these great like they're great without that but that little change up in the texture is what makes these things perfect man so let's do this three two one wow these never cease to amaze me man you got that blueberry flavor the cheesecake flavor they just combined to create something magical and that texture is perfect wow check it out man got another one here little cheesecake pocket right in the middle of it how can we lose how can we lose these really turned out way better than they have any right to ma'am and what i love about making the mini muffins as opposed to big ones it's like a mental trick you get more right wait 16 muffins i mean you're going to be full after but what that does to your brain you're like i got to eat 16 muffins yesterday how am i dieting what if you took one massive muffin let's say you went to starbucks at one of their massive muffins that's the same amount of calories that's in all this with no protein like i always say man we're making better choices around here eating foods we love these are so freaking good and really besides that muffin mix packet you should have all the ingredients at the house like i said every grocery store near me that i go to has those packets they're like 88 cents and you can use one of those packets it'll last you for three of these recipes so stock up on them and i assume you already have protein powder plain greek yogurt if you're following the anabolic diet you got a lot of these staples just kind of sitting around so ain't nothing stopping you but get in there and whip this up i'm telling you man you you eat this one even if you ain't a fan of some of the actual more meals like the meats the proteins the pizzas things like that if you dislike the desserts this one could change your life those little cream cheese pockets are just the best so in this entire recipe if you make it exactly how i did it for all these mini muffins 16 of them what you end up with is 588 calories only 8 grams of fat 55 grams of protein 74 grams of carbs 0 grams of fiber so 588 calories for all these muffins and to be honest i'm like pretty satisfied right now i can save these for later but i'm a little behind on calories so i'm just gonna eat them all but like i always say with these right split it into portions for me 588 calories is a meal so i sweat in that but if you maybe are a woman you're on a lower calorie diet you don't do as much cardio you don't even train that much you just need more of a calorie deficit eat half of them eat a quarter of them right make it make like four of them a mini snack just think ahead a little bit man you'll be good down to the last four final one perfect you guys saw with my physique update earlier man i mean on average i do five videos a week and i am following this diet a hundred percent all week long man i'm not just gonna magically eat some pastries i wake up tomorrow and i've lost my ass my physique went to crap man that's not how this works if you make the right choice there's no such thing as good or bad foods you gotta hit your protein goal and your calorie goal every day depending on what that goal is for you you do that you hit those goals your body has no choice but to make a change man people out here trying to dress this whole process up like it's got to be this complicated thing like you got to have your veggies you gotta do this you gotta do that but i'm telling you forget what you think you know man just try it out take some accountability man do a little bit of tracking and i guarantee man something's gonna happen and it's gonna be positive you already know rjf anabolic cookbook link in my description we just added this recipe and to be honest man i i think we got the best cookbook on the internet because it accomplishes multiple things if you're a foodie like me if you love food if you used to live for your cheat meals on old diets and the reason you couldn't ever stay in shape was because you loved food so much this

next time ladies and gentlemen i'll see each and every one of you at the next video see you guys about to just go whip up another bathroom off", "yt-ZxWsOmHY": "so that I will be sharing how to make Nobby blueberry cheesecake for the ingredients we need 18 pieces of Marie biscuits or any plain biscuits 110 grams of butter that we're gonna melt 2 tbsp of sugar and 2 tbsp of desiccated coconut so I crushed the biscuits and I melted the butter we're gonna combine the crushed biscuits the sugar and the desiccated coconut give it a mix and then once it's totally mix add the melted butter adding the butter don't add it all at once just check the consistency of the mixture if you find that it's too dry add more butter you know that it's correct but if you press the mixture and it clumps up together just like this I have a 9-inch springform pan lined with parchment paper on the side and at the bottom then just dump in the prepared cross press it until it's welcome back today and then just put this in the fridge while we move on to the next step now for the filling we need 1 cup of whipping cream 500 grams of cream cheese 1 cup + 1 tbsp of icing sugar that is sifted two and a half tablespoon of water two and 1/2 teaspoon of gelatine one teaspoon of lemon juice one teaspoon of vanilla so to begin we just kind of bloom the gelatine so combine the water and the gelatine give it as a mix and then set this aside now with the cream cheese it's important for it to be at room temperature so we just kind of beat the cream cheese first using an electric mixer use the spatula to scrape down the side of the bowl and then continue mixing at this point you can add one cup of icing sugar or powdered sugar with the sweetness of the cheesecake it depends on you you can add more sugar or you can add less if you don't want it to be too sweet occasionally stop the scrape down the side of the bowl at this point we can add the vanilla give it a quick mix before adding the lemon juice with the lemon juice it's optional but lemon juice makes the Cheesecake thicker set this aside for a while while we move on to the whipping cream so with the whipping cream whip this until it reaches soft peak stage just like this and remember the bloom gelatine it is now time to melt this in the microwave for about 10 seconds or until it becomes liquid again just like this and then if the cream cheese one quick mix just to loosen it up a little bit and then we're going to add the whipped cream into additions using the folding method if you want don't want to use gelatine you can put this in a cup and it will be this thick now it's time to add the gelatine all at once make sure that the gelatine has cooled down don't add it when it's hot seeing it since it comes from the microwave and this is now ready to be transferred into the prepared springform pan use a spatula - I'm smooth the top but it doesn't need to be perfect since we're gonna put blueberry pie filling on top and then we're gonna place this in the fridge for about four hours or overnight so once the cheesecake is said you can release the cheesecake from the springform pan [Music] [Music] now for garnish this is optional this is half a cup of whipping cream half a teaspoon of vanilla and one and a half tablespoon of icing sugar by the way all the icing sugar should be sifted [Music] and then beat this until it reaches stiff peak stage just like this transfer this into a piping bag I use one M Wilton tip but again adding whipping cream on top or whipped cream on top is optional it will just serve as a border for the blueberry pie filling so I'm just piping the whipped cream on the top side and then add blueberry filling so I'm using a store-bought blueberry filling and then add about four to six heaping teaspoon of the blueberry filling or you can put as little or as much as you like now just move the blueberry pie filling to cover all the spots of the cheesecake and this is the finished product and since it is the festive season I decided to put a little bit of holy sprinkles on the top this is optional again [Music] [Music] [Music] so easy to make and this is the decorated finished product [Music] and just to show you what it looks like when you slice the cake the first one is always the hardest to slice but once you pass the first slice you will cut a cake perfectly thank you so much for watching and I hope you give this a try this cheesecake recipe is so easy to make and very delicious thank you so much for watching bye", "si4ZbtKs2EI": "[Music] hey everyone today i'm going to take you step by step through our keto blueberry cheesecake muffins i could not find the original source of the original part of the recipe that we used for this you can look it up on pinterest several people have done it this is our variation of it and we're going to make it into mini muffins because we're doing it to go with something else we're going to do our hashtag casserole with that that i did remember in film a couple of years back i think and the link is going to be up here for the hashbrown casserole recipe but today as you can hear we're fixing to bake muffins step one before you do anything else go ahead and lay out your cream cheese to start softening it's going to take an entire block of cream cheese you can use less cream cheese if you want to as you just heard my oven was beeping that is let me know that it is preheated to 350 degrees also double check to make sure that your oven is empty before turning it on next go ahead and make sure that you have your muffin pans laid out i am choosing to do mini muffins this time because like i said i wanted them to be bite-sized for the meal that i'm making them to go with you actually can buy little mini muffin liners to go with these kind of mini muffin pans at walmart so we bought these we're going to line each of these with individual ones also check the holiday section at the holidays they have different color prints for each of the holidays that i've seen so far we also checked out some at aldi's that were christmas print back at christmas time just to let you know you can use any size muffin pan that you want you can use full size i am like i said i'm using the bite size this time you can also use the mega muffin pans and we have also made them into mini loaf pans first ingredient that you're going to need is almond flour you can use any nut flour you want and making it truly keto check your carb count on your bags before you purchase them we have used both the nature eats and the crusties brands of almond flour we're going to start with measuring out three cups of almond flour next we're going to add two tablespoons of baking powder this baking powder is certified to be gluten free so we are going to there it is we are going to use this baking powder specifically because the other goal for this is not just to make a keto but to make it as a gluten-free snack next you're going to add three-fourths of a teaspoon of salt you can use any salt that you like i prefer sea salt especially for this recipe i also prefer the fine sea salt when baking [Music] next we are going to mix all of our dry ingredients up i'm going to choose to use the spoonula for mixing this since i'm going to be mixing and eventually scraping into the muffin pans this moonlight comes from star pack it's a brand that you can purchase on amazon and i will link it in the affiliate below but like i said next we're going to just mix the dry ingredients until they are mixed together next we're going to start adding our wet ingredients you can choose to do wet ingredients in a separate bowl i did not because i did not want to have to wash the second mixing bowl just to be honest first what ingredient that we're going to add is an entire pint of heavy whipping cream we choose the heavy whipping cream from aldi's because it is the only brand we found that has zero grams of carbs next we are going to use a 1 4 or a quarter cup of the tarani sugar free french vanilla syrup this syrup will work as a vanilla flavoring and it also works as our sugar substitute for this recipe and lastly of our wet ingredients we're going to be adding three large eggs [Music] next we are going to stir in one cup of frozen blueberries you can use any brand of blue frozen blueberries that you want i have been preferring to get the season's choice from aldi's because in my local area is the cheapest best quality of unsweetened blueberries that we can find the next step is the part that's completely optional for you we actually prefer to take the cream cheese cut it up into teeny tiny chunks after the batter it has been poured into the muffin cups push the teeny tiny chunks into the center of each of the muffins that way it is a cream cheese bite to go in the center of each of these if you're doing it for gluten free and not low carb you can slightly cover these in powdered sugar or confectioners sugar to go in there before you place them in to give it a little bit more sweetness flavor but because again the goal for this was to do keto and gluten free we are not going to do that if you choose not to do that then you need to cut up your cream cheese and add it before adding the blueberries in and mix it with a blender you can also again choose to sweeten your blueberries with sugar before adding them to the recipe but if you're going to blend your cream cheese up make sure you cream you add the cream cheese before adding the blueberries the reason i didn't say that now because we're just now fixing to use our cream cheese and we're going to cut it up into tiny chunks and add it as we're putting it into our muffin cups by the way this will not do just this pan this will do several batches and i will try to let you know at the end how many batches of these we are going to do but the next step is we're going to come over here where we had our tablespoon measuring cup used we're going to dip it in and try to make sure that we at least have one blueberry in each cup which again if you wanted to you could also opt to putting individual blueberries into your muffin pans as you go and add it as you want you will have to keep track of how much you're using if you're wanting to keep track of the exact carb count but i like taking my measuring cups that i've already used or measuring spoons in this case and just filling up with batter if it becomes too full then use your one quarter teaspoon one to take a little bit out and put it into the next cup instead so we're going to fill all these up then we are going to cut up our cream cheese and get them ready to place into the up here's about the size of the cream cheese chunks i'm going to put in each one of these probably could go a little bit smaller but i'm going to just literally place it like that and then you push into the center kind of make sure the batteries cover a little bit then you move on to the rest of them here is what the first batch of two dozen mini muffins looks like and here is how much batter is left so it will make quite a bit of it normally i can make i can't remember if it's two one or two dozen plus a mini loaf pan of those whenever i'm baking them for like regular sized muffins the muffin timing will depend on what size you're doing i think i'm going to start with 12 to 15 minutes for these the regular ones take 15 to 20 and loaf pans can take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes depending on your oven and the size of your loaf pan here's what they look like out of the oven for 12 minutes let's put one on a plate and cut it in half so to do a quick recipe wrap up when you make the mini muffins it made three batches which for me a batch of muffins is usually two dozen per batch because when i do regular size muffins that's how much it seems to make per batch this is two dozen so it made a total of 30 let's see 72. it made 72 muffins so it made 72 mini muffins and i think it made just exactly that much and it used the entire block of cream cheese so keep that in mind when you're making it like i said before sometimes we've made them and then have like a mini loaf pan left over so it just depends on how much you're making and how you make it but they tasted really good i am going to try with more egg next time when matt was cutting it apart he's like why is it so crumbly and i said well most keto muffin recipes are that way that i've made and he said well i think we should add more egg because i think that if we have more egg it won't be as crumbly so i was like oh that's a good idea so we're going to try it again with more egg and i'm not going to do another recipe video for that but i might like throw it up on instagram or something um but i'll let you know but anyways let us know if you try the recipe let us know if you add more egg to it if you like it better that way or if you like it crumblier some people like their muffins crumblier i don't know let us know if you like it though thank you so much for watching and we will see you next time", "5Jmce2tUn88": "Hey guys This time I\u2019m going to make blue berry and matcha cheese cake with homemade yogurt. Homemade yogurt is actually very easy to make and it\u2019s delicious so please give it a try. First, add the yogurt starter culture (or live yogurt) and fresh milk in a jar, and leave it in a room that is between 25 \u2013 30degree Celsius for a day, or follow the instructions of your yogurt starter culture. Next, I\u2019m gonna make blue berry jam. All you need is blue berries, sugar and lemon juice. Add the blue berries and sugar in a pot and heat them up until the sugar melts. Then, add lemon juice and wait for the jam to cool down. Next I'm gonna make butter. You can just use unsalted butter to skip this step. Put the double cream in a bottle and shake it for about 5 minutes. Pour out the butter milk and you\u2019ll have fresh butter left in the bottle. Next, chop the white chocolate and melt it in a bowl. Sieve the matcha powder. Split the white chocolate in half and mix the matcha powder in one of them. Pour the matcha chocolate in a tray and draw lines with white chocolate like this, or you can draw however you want. Press a cookie cutter or a glass into the chocolate to make a lid we\u2019ll use later. Place the chocolate into the fridge to harden. Next, whisk cream cheese, yogurt, and butter milk in a bowl. Mix half with matcha powder and half with the blue berry jam. Pour the cream in a glass and keep it in a fridge. Next, add the agar* powder and water in a pot and boil them. Again, mix with matcha powder and blue berry jam. Then, pour it on the cream cheese. Next I'm gonna make a buttercream flower. Whisk the butter and white bean paste with blue berry and matcha powder. This time I\u2019m using a tip and small turn table like these. Fill the piping bag with the icing and now you\u2019re ready. Stick baking sheet on the turn table. Squeeze out the icing like this to make it into a flower shape. You only need one of each but I made extra. Next, I\u2019m going to make spun sugar. Boil sugar and sugar syrup in a pot. When it becomes gold, cool down the pot to thicken the sugar. Then, shake it with a fork. Place your cups inside larger vases. You can decorate the chocolate lids however you want. For a fun effect and to keep the cakes cool, put dry ice between the cups and vases and pour water into it. Then put the lids on and done! Gochiso sama deshita! Do you want to try the blue berry?

crackers under former few of the ingredients and we'll get started we're going to be using condensed milk any cream or whipping cream grain crackers vanilla and for the blueberry sauce is going to be blueberries sugar lemon and we're going to be using some corn starch so what we're going to start with first we're going to make our blueberry sauce so it will be cool enough to add into our ice cream and before you get started on that put a bowl for mixing your whipping cream in your freezer because you want that nice and cold for when you're starting to whip off your cream so let's get started stove top to make our memory table okay so we'll start with making their blueberry sauce and then because we need that nice and cool or at low temperature at least so that we can mix in our ice cream this is a delicious recipe by the way you're going to love it two cups of blueberries it could be frozen or fresh if it's frozen in a little bit first before you put it into your little saucepan and next we're going to be adding in 1 tablespoon full of cornstarch and now we're going to be using 3 tablespoons of white sugar we're going to be using tablespoonful of lemon and it's lemon zest now you can eyeball it pour it into your your measuring spoon or you can just eyeball it whichever is easier but right now I'm just pouring it into the bowl and then some sense and this this is it a nice piece and like I said citrus citrusy and sweetness mix well together especially for this dish so wouldn't breathe into just a few great of that so this sauce is not going to take very long we just need this to all condensed down and it probably takes maybe between five of seven minutes just to turn into a nice sauce but so let it cook there on medium heat and then check it after okay so there is your sauce nice and creamy and you want to keep the very phone you can sell to mass room unless you want to let's pour it back into a measuring cup and then we're going to put it on ice and then after that we'll start whipping up our cream okay so let's say we're going to put on a bowl of ice I got to put it into the side and mainly decks because I want for it to go to room temperature because we can mix it in with our ice cream this is all made ice cream made with whipped cream condensed milk next the factor that we're going to be using for our cheesecake in there not necessarily cheese in this but I'll show you as we go so we're going to be using three cups of heavy cream or whipping cream so we're going to be using three cups of whipping cream and and we're going to put it into a cold bowl again said in the previous clip I'm going to put in a little bit more you need three cups for ice cream but I want to put in a little bit more because I want to have a little bit extra left over for when it's frozen to dog on the top and I'll tell you more about that so I'm going to put in an extra half cup so that's three and a half cups but just to have a little extra so what I'm going to get doing now is starting to blend our looking cream you're going to need a nice speed blender so I'm going to turn this on low medium ty and we're going to get this blending into nice sauce peeps okay so this is what its gonna look like okay so this is what your whipping cream is going to look like and again you could use any cream whatever you got on hand so what I'm going to do now is start mixing in or folding in the condensed milk and the not so I'm going to show you that what we do first we'll add in a full can of condensed Mac to scrape it all into your whipping cream you want to do all this well fairly quickly put that to the side and we're going to be putting in a teaspoon full of vanilla you can go real vanilla or vanilla extract whichever you got on it on hand so you're going to fold this together you don't want to stir it because folding it together is going to give us that consistency of a cream cheese and it will look absolutely delicious and it'll taste delicious as well okay hold it in so you only need to fold it until you start to see almost the condensed milk combined in which your whipping cream so now what we're going to do we got four full pieces of brain crackers and and what we're going to do is crack it into pieces like this and you're going to fold them into your mixture and when I say four so still be four full ones and it's go to to be about one cup of together we don't want the ones that's already cut for you you want to do it yourself because you want to put it in chunks like this now the grain crackers is going to give it that texture inside this ice cream but it's also going to have a little bit of a crunch but not much because once it's frozen you're just going to spin off to that that texture and that nice flavor brain crackers but this is how they sort of look like there so now I'm going to show you what we're going to do next so again you want to make sure that your blueberry sauce is at room temperature because you go while it's hot you don't want to know your whipping cream mixture for your ice creams that it feels won't ever touch me so now I put this inside only a sheet of pressure paper on one you know please keep in 8x5 pen or you can use the round pen exactly matter whatever you want to shave them your ice cream I wanted wedges because I wanted to comment in a chunk and then I can cut it in slices so this is what it's going to look like they're pretty much you want that little bit over the top so you can fold over it so what we're going to do now we're going to pour half of our lecture into this hole and I want to take a little dollop of this into a bowl because we're going to use this to put over the top of the screen when it comes out frozen so I'm going to put that to the side or you can just use whipping cream that's fine as well you don't need to have all of that mixture so we're going to spread this in the pan and then we're going to take nice big dollop of our blueberry sauce and you're going to put directly in the middle Azamat about making a mess and then you're going to take your knife and just give it a little swirl around like this because you want to mix it in between but yet have a little bit of a design there that's going to look like okay and we're going to do the same again we're going to put some more over the top and you go to spread it across into your pen again you can use 8 by 5 on 10 by 5 whichever you got bread pan or you could use around 10 whichever you want to make your expenditure the way you like too much container so you put some more out your blueberry sauce in there and it's going to be at room temperature not hot or disallowed melts into your parents probably still be okay I don't know but this is the best way to do it this is what it's going to look like here okay so this is what your blueberry cheesecake ice cream which grain crackers is going to look like we're going to put this in your freezer you could leave it there for overnight pick it up the next day if you want to use it put it in for 6 hours colors in accident and then let it go the duration whichever way you do it it doesn't matter you don't actually worry about spoiling it so put it directly into your freezer like this and then wait until it's frozen and if you've got any of the mixture that's left over you can put it into small servings if you want to but you won't have any leftover going to it'll fill the full pan I'm going to put this in the freezer and I got one done in advance so I can show you what it looks like okay so now I'm going to show you what the frozen on the cover look like so the reason why is a convert X term over the top like it's good to forget it would it's not a big deal but just loosen this away from time it's just wasn't very here overnight thank you my to comment take this out and I'm also going to take it out of the paper so people see what this beautiful chunk of blueberry cream cheese ice cream is going to look like so this is what your in screen is going to look like and it's absolutely delicious so what I'm going to do now I'm going to cut it a slice off and I've got some waiter bowls that I'm going to be putting it into but you could do this well you can make a scoop of ice cream if you don't want to add it you know in pieces but this is what it looks like inside edge looking delicious okay so I got a couple of wafer bowls that I'm going to be putting they're taking us out and I'm gonna cut this self in another put it into the way for a bowl now you can do this same mixture if you want to use some other flavor if you don't want to do with blueberry which I'm already recommend America that's what I'm doing today you could use lemon you could use strawberry whatever you like to use so I'm going to delve a little bit of that whipped cream over the top of each one and then I'm going to add some fresh blueberries over the top of course my mother is just drooling in now because it just looks so good and I can't wait to taste it and then just a little bit of the soft that you could have left over or could be in the pan that you cooked it in so I'm going to put that on there and this one right there and that's what you're all made blueberry cream cheese ice cream with graham crackers it's going to look like and to top it off you can put another piece of grain crackers there with it you can break it in pieces or you can just put it in one big piece it doesn't matter but that's just that extra crunch so this is it this is after you made this all made ice cream I don't think you'll never color by any more in the stores because this is absolutely delicious the denser episode of my native kitchen and I hope you found this episode helpful for you today please try

tea biscuits to form a nice little crunchy base and then a cream cheese blueberry and of course our white chocolate filling so so much going on so many awesome flavors but start with your drooling

chocolate into the bowl yep okay and to that I'm gonna add a knob of butter and our caster sugar now if you need all these exact measurements they're all available down below know some of these troubles to accidentally not make it into I might accidentally have already wet on and weighed it out ha ha ha we need to melt it's about 56 seconds yeah in the microwave that'd be just fine now we've got those bashed up which has melted butter so if you can just stir that through and they're awesome now in the microwave you see how easy is if you haven't got one just in a pan of simmering water as ever it will do the same job but Jeff if you can pass the cream and the cream cheese whoa thank you so our cream cheese goes in our cream goes in like that and then all you don't in fact probably easier with a whisk Jamie is tell that's nice and smooth get rid of all the lumps meanwhile Barry and I will do the buttery visible base now we've got like a poaching egg rinses there is no bottom to it which is absolutely fine alternatively a loose bottom cake tin or something you can do one big one you want about a third biscuit base to two-thirds cream cheese cheese about the right ratio perfect come back to that Jamie you've got your bit nicely mixed at which point we'll add our white chocolate sugar and butter mix so make sure we get all that in there this is you eat some leave none of it in the bowl it was just that there we go mix that in a tiny drop on the vanilla extract and with exception of a few we'll keep that for later all of our blueberries roots out really nice you can begin to crush some of those if you want they don't have to break up but some of the breaking a bit marble take much fun this is right take your whisk down without making a mess mess is optional as always now this is a really cream cheesy mix and that's going to go in there so it makes you got plenty of those blueberries in there get in there as well acted about this awesome awesome dessert up right at this point they need to go into a fridge to set up so Jamie into the fridge I think you'll see one in there that is already made no do this way no oh perfect now at this point because it hasn't of all we need to just push out so warm up the edges warm hands mm-hmm and then just gently push the whole thing out now Jamie think we've got a nice blue plate to reflect the wonderful

combined my favorite dessert and favored berry to make my blueberry cheesecake macarons and these are so good they taste just like a bite of cheesecake I'm topping my macaron cookies off with graham cracker crumbs and creating a blueberry cheesecake filling for the inside let me show you how to make these I'm going to start things off with my dry ingredients first I measured out 120 grams of almond flour and 200 grams of confectioner's sugar and just sisto's into a large mixing bowl and I also have these ingredients in cup measurements on my website just head down into my video description box for my meringue I've measured out 100 grams of egg whites and 50 grams of white granulated sugar and then make some high speed just until stiff peaks form click transfer the meringue into the dry ingredients and now this next ingredient is optional if you don't have it your macarons will still taste a really good I'm going to add half a teaspoon of cream cheese baking emulsion it's going to add that cheesecake flavor and then I'm going to fold and mix in the meringue into the dry ingredients facing through the bottom of the bowl to make sure you get all the dry ingredients combined and then finish mixing the macaron batter until it reaches lava stage I've lined two baking sheets with silicone mats you can also use parchment paper transfer my macaron batter into a pastry bag and now I'm going to pipe my cookies onto the mat and I'm going to sprinkle the top of these cookies with some graham cracker crumbs once you have your macarons piped give your pans a few hard taps against your kitchen counter to release any trapped air bubbles and then let the cookie stands for one hour at room temperature to allow a thin shell to form on the outside and then bake the cookies at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 18 minutes while my macarons are in the oven I'm going to prepare my blueberry cream cheese filling I have four ounces of cream cheese that I've softened at room temperature go to use my hand mixer for blended together until it's fluffy then adding 1/4 cup of blueberry preserves at 1/4 teaspoon of the same cream cheese and Multan that are used for the macarons a pinch of salt and give that a mix next add in about 1 1 & a half cups of confectioner's sugar and mix that in once your cookies are baked you want to let them cool completely on a wire rack and then pipe on that blueberry cream cheese filling and then sandwich these duties together and that's a guy from a blueberry cheesecake macarons once you have the cookies assembled you want to keep them refrigerated for two to three days in an airtight container and when you're ready to enjoy them just bring them up to room temperature now it's time to enjoy one I've already been nibbling away at one they're just so irresistible hmm you guys are going to fall head-over-heels in love with this new macaron flavor I love the distant as a graham cracker crumbs on top of the cookies and that blueberry cream-cheese filling is so good perfect combination of flavors and so delicious you're looking for a new macaron flavor you've got to give these a try and that blueberry filling is also really good I think I'm going to have to use it in one of my cakes coming up soon hope you guys have enjoyed this video recipe and I'll see you next time", "XR5D5H1wWyA": "hi guys i'm jenn johns welcome back to the channel and welcome to the canadian wilderness behind me is the Purcell mountains and a glacier-fed lake this is a really popular spot for picking huckleberries that's something that local people around here really like to do and usually we're making like huckleberry jam or even huckleberry pie but I'm going to show you how to make huckleberry cheesecake now I've had Ruby out with me picking she's uh taking a break in the lake here and I'm going to finish picking fill up my bucket here and then I'm going to be heading back to the kitchen to show you guys how to make the cheesecake if you don't like huckleberries or you can't find them you can also substitute it for blueberries so let's get pickin and heading back home [Music] we're going to start with making the crust it's a really simple Oreo crust so in here I have one bag of Oreos completely crushed up I use the food processor it's about the equivalent of three cups of the crushed cookie crumbs and we're also going to need about between two tablespoons and a quarter cup of melted butter so all I have to do is take my melted butter and I'm going to pour it into my cookie crumbs let's like that and then just using a spatula I'm going to mix it up until it's all combined once the crumbs and butter are combined we're going to place them into a 9-inch round springform pan the springform pan makes it really easy for you to pop out the Cheesecake afterwards so I'm just spreading it here with a spatula first just getting it kind of evenly as even as you can to start and then I'm going to take the bottom of a flat glass and I'm just pressing it down once I've got this completely pressed down I'm going to pop it into the fridge until I'm ready to use it so you want to let the butter solidify the cookie crumbs into a nice hard crust once the crust is completed we are going to make the huckleberry filling you can also use blueberries if Huckleberry's aren't available for you you're going to need one cup of the berries and you can use fresh or frozen we're also going to need two tablespoons of granulated sugar and we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of liquid honey so I have my huckleberries in a pan I'm going to turn my heat up to a medium-high heat and I'm going to take a masher and I'm going to mash the berries and it's going to flatten them down a bit they will break down while they're actually cooking and it will be easier so this is something that I will do throughout the cooking process just get them started off there a lot of those little ridges there now we're going to add the other ingredients so I'm putting in the sugar and top and then the honey as well it's going to drip out of here so all that lovely honey I'm going to use my spatula to kind of help that get out here there we go and the honey and the sugar is just force weakness the huckleberries and the blueberries can be a little bit tart so we're just adding a little bit of sugar and so I'm just going to continue to stir this and I'm pressing down while I'm stirring them because I want the berries to turn into like just kind of flatten and get that nice juice is coming out of them and while they cook that will be a lot easier as well so I'm going to continue to let it cook and I'll be back half way through the process once the mixture starts to boil it's going to be a lot easier to match up the berries so I'm using my masher here just trying to get them you won't get them all and you'll still want chunks anyway so we're not worried about getting a really smooth mixture here just going to get the most of it here and we're going to let the mixture boil until it starts to thicken once the mixture has thickened what we're going to do is turn the temperature down and we're going to remove the berry mixture from the heat you're going to let it cool completely before using it in the Cheesecake we're starting on the Cheesecake layers now and what we have to do first is bloom some gelatin so here I have half a cup of water that I've just boiled I've got two envelopes of unflavored gelatin and that's about 14 grams of it and then here I have half a cup of cold water which I'm going to pour the gelatin into first so I'm just mixing that up and it's going to stir it here so because this is a no-bake cheesecake we are using gelatin to hold the Cheesecake layer together when you're doing a no-bake cheesecake you need to have some sort of something that holds it together and that's we're using this gelatin mixture for so I'm just going to that's about mixed all the clumps are gone now I'm going to take my boiling water and then add that in here and that's going to dissolve the gelatin we're just going to set this aside because we need it to come down to room temperature because we don't want to add this hot liquid to our cream cheese mixture to start the cream cheese portion we need a brick and a half of cream cheese and so that is about 12 ounces of cream cheese we're going to need three tablespoons of granulated sugar and we're going to be using one teaspoon of lemon so what I'm going to do first is take my hand mixer and I'm going to beat my cream cheese once the cream cheese is soft I can add in the granulated sugar and I'm going to add in the lemon juice the lemon juice just helps to kind of cut through any of the sweetness of the berries and give it a little bit of tart so I'm just going to continue to mix that to light and fluffy and then we're going to set it to the side the second part of the cream cheese mixture needs a 375 milliliters of whipping cream which I'm going to pour into a medium sized bowl we have that poured into there and then we also need to add into it half a cup of icing sugar and I'll put that on top as well and then I've switched my hand mixer to whisk whisk attachment and I'm going to whip it until the whipping cream is stiff so I have my cream cheese mixture and my whipping cream mixture here and I'm going to dump my cream cheese or my whipping cream mixture into the cream cheese just like this we're going to combine them now I'm just getting that all in there and then I'm going to take my beaters again and mix it into completely once I've got those two mixed together I'm going to take my gelatin here with my water pouring it into the cream cheese and whipping cream mixture and I'm going to beat that until it is completely combined once we've got everything mixed together ready to pour our mixture into our springform pan with our Oreo crust I'm going to put about half of it into the bottom here it makes about 5 cups of mixture so you want to put about 2 and a half to 3 cups here down here in the bottom so once I've got this mixture in I want to solidify this layer before I go on to the next step so I'm going to pop it into the freezer for like five to 10 minutes until it has a crust that's not going to allow the blueberry or the the huckleberry mixture to be poured into it and like dented and indent it once this first layer has solidified we're going to spoon on our huckleberry mixture I'm just going to put it kind of just randomly here I just want to make spreading it out a little bit easier and I'm going to be using an offset spatula to do that so you can see the huckleberries are a really beautiful dark color they taste absolutely delicious as well if you've never had one definitely want to try to seek one out and find them so now I'm going to take my offset spatula and just spread it gently going towards the edges I don't want to press into that first layer at all though if it does go it's not a huge deal I'm just trying to keep it more like a distinct layer in between the Cheesecake and the berry part I'm going to just smooth it out kind of probably about like that just using that offset spatula and then I'm going to take the remaining amount of my cheesecake mixture here and we're going to pour it on top it's going to go around pouring that getting that all on top now this is going to have to go into the freezer again for about 10 minutes while I prepare the next layer there's one more layer to go the top layer of the cheesecake is a jelly layer so I have one box of the grape jello here in my bowl and I'm going to add in one cup of boiling water into it I'm just preparing the jello layer just as you would from the box itself so I'm just mixing that together letting that part dissolve and then I'm going to take the cold layer or sorry the cold water and add that to this layer here I'm pouring in the cold layer and then I'm going to let the jello come to room temperature you can even put it in a little bit of an ice bath but again I don't want to add this to the cake without it cooling down a bit or I'll just melt that cheesecake layer once the cake has set this top layer we're going to add our jello layer here and I'm just pouring it onto a spoon just to help prevent it from digging into that cake like if you were to pour it in a solid stream you do risk making kind of like a little hole where you're pouring that in so I'm just going to start with about that much and then I'm going to drop in some extra berries cut it just one by one and the as I see that the larger huckleberries aren't quite covered with the jello I'll pour a little bit more in but I'm going to fill up the top here just kind of placing them all around in different spots just getting them make it look really nice like just kind of scatter them all around so the final thing that we have to do is put it back into the fridge and you want to let it solidify for at least two hours you want to make sure it's nice and solid and then you just have to pop it out of the springform pan and you'll be ready to slice and serve it so I'm going to come back when that is ready so

into a plate add powdered sugar you'll eat just 1/2 cup take out the dough that was resting for treat for us you may use an ice cream scoop I used 1/8 measuring cup this ensures equal size roll it out and then roll in the powdered sugar [Music] place it on a baking tray lined with a baking paper don't forget to preheat the oven to 175 degree Celsius place the tray in the preheated oven for 12 minutes or maximum 15 minutes take the tray out and while it's still warm place some chocolate chips on top or a small piece of any chocolate and then so it can be head walk or after cooling down I love it warm [Music] it has a fuzzy texture and it's absolutely divine [Music] next is a really soft and moist dates cake with caramel sauce and for this of course you will need soft and fleshy dates almost one cup you may add more dates and reduce the amount of sugar it's up to you here I have used 1 cup pitted dates to this add four teaspoons instant coffee powder [Music] add one cup hot water give a mix and cover keep aside into a ball sift 1 and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda and quarter teaspoon salt into another large mixing bowl add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of vegetable oil I have used sunflower oil you will even use melted butter then add 3/4 cup of tightly packed brown sugar it's okay to use white sugar if you don't have brown sugar beat for a minute then you'll need to ex adding one at a time then add vanilla essence 1 teaspoon [Music] meanwhile the dates have gone really soft add that to the bout and beat for a minute then add the sifted floor adding half at a time beat on low speed for three to four minutes or until well combined take a baking tray spread some oil or butter all over pour the batter place it in a preheated oven at 180

over the cake while it's still hot slice and have it it's really soft moist and tasty next is strawberry cream cheese parfait which I had shared a picture on my Instagram so here's a recipe for the simple treat into a blender add some digestive biscuits almost 8 to 10 biscuits pulse it few times then add a quarter cup melted butter and again pulse few times so this is what you get and then keep aside [Music] here I have taken fresh strawberries you may use frozen if you don't find the fresh ones chop them into pieces [Music] keep a few aside for garnish add the chopped strawberries in a saucepan [Music] do this add half cup sugar keep on medium-low heat and let it boil into another ball add 1 cup cream cheese to this add 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla essence and whisk well whisk till it becomes really smooth and creamy and the sugar is all dissolved meanwhile the strawberries have turned soft so off the flame and let it cool down into a glass add a spoon of the biscuits plus lie to level it [Music] meanwhile the strawberries have cooled down a bit so blended to a theory if you have piping bag it's easy to add in the glass if not then use a spoon add the cream cheese as a next layer then goes the biscuits again and add some strawberry puree then again the cream cheese then the biscuits you may even add chopped strawberries and nuts it's up to you at the top pour some fury and garnish with a sliced strawberry refrigerate for an hour and the easy yet delicious parfait is ready [Music] next is chocolate truffles with coconut the most easiest recipe of all all you need is one tin condensed milk that's 395 grams then 2 tablespoons cocoa powder this is desiccated coconut that's dry coconut adding 1/2 cup you can make this even without the coconut just a mix [Music] now this is orange zest that takes these truffles to the next level so don't skip it it adds a lot of flavor you may add around 1/2 to 1 teaspoon chocolate and orange really have a good combination add a piece of butter I would say 50 grams and keep on medium heat and cook stirring it all time you can see the mixture is really loose when you scrape the bottom the mixture flows back quickly you need to cook till it becomes thick now the mixture is coming off the pan and it's thick and cooked so it's time to off the flame transfer to a heat proof glass bowl cover and let it cool down you don't have to place it in the refrigerator once it's cooled down it's time to roll so in a plate add desiccated coconut take out the chocolate mixture take a spoonful and roll you will get a

tablespoons of sugar [Music] keep on low flame let it boil and be soft add a tablespoon of lemon juice boil for a minute and then off the flame if you have a food processor use that or a blender would also do here I have added the digestive biscuits into a ziploc bag crush with a rolling pin you'll need a total of 100 grams crushed biscuits then melt some refer grams of butter [Music] mix the melted butter into the biscuits [Music] so this is the base of the Cheesecake you lead a springform tin for the cake spread the biscuit mix and layer it evenly keep in the refrigerator until we make

"welcome back to pastry maestra i'm teresa and today i'm making guilt-free blueberry cheesecake the sweetness i'm making today is completely guilt-free there is no gluten in it eggs are banned from this recipe and sugar sugar is in another galaxy a complete divinely sweet yet healthy package add some fresh strawberries blueberries raspberries and kiwi to the mix and you'll get an absolutely perfect sweet treat perfect now in this intro i want to pay a special attention to stevia a miraculous and healthy sweetener that packs a titanic sweet punch in zero calories zero so stevia is a sweetener and sugar substitute derived from the leaves of the plant species stevia rebelliana native to brazil and paraguay the plant stevia rebodiana has been used for more than 1500 years by the guarani people of south america the leaves have been used traditionally for hundreds of years in both brazil and paraguay to sweeten local teas and medicines and as a sweet treat according to wikipedia the genus was named for spanish 16th century botanist and physician pedro jaime steve but it was moses giacomo bertoni swiss botanist who in 1899 first described the plant and the sweet taste in detail so-called stevial glycosides are the active compounds of this sweetener which have 30 to 150 times the sweetness of sugar one source on the web claims that this ratio is even bigger as much as 200 to 400 times the sweetness of sugar but i can't say for sure either way the body does not metabolize the glycosidizing stevia hence the zero calorie is tough and not only that diabetics kids and pregnant and breastfeeding women can safely consume stevia isn't that just great now i must warn you that there is no universal stevia to sugar ratio formula therefore it is of utmost importance that you carefully read the label so that you know what amount of stevia will replace a teaspoon of sugar the stevia i'm using in this video is 10 times sweeter than sugar so the ratio is 1 to 10. if your stevia is stronger please adjust the quantity in the recipe okay nothing more to be said about stevia so let's get to work i'll show you how to make super yummy guilt-free blueberry

again so let's make this Diwali fusion with fusion Diwali so today we are going to make blueberry and rescue la cheesecake with hazelnuts so let us start making it so we are going to begin by taking 120 grams of Mary biscuits into a food processor and pulse this until it resembles breadcrumbs now add some melted butter to it and mix it until it is a most like wet sand now going to add the biscuit and butter mixture to a 9-inch springform cake tin and going to press it down just get anything that has a flat surface and press it down just like a glass once it is all flattened all press down now we are going to refrigerate this until our batter is all ready so now we are going to take ten grams of agar agar and going to add it to a bigger bowl along with that add in 1/3 cup of water and let it sit for 10 minutes now I'm going to take 300 ml of cream and whip until stiff peaks so our cream is whipped to stiff peaks now I'm going to keep it aside so I'm going to begin making the Cheesecake mix which is going to start by taking 200 grams of cream cheese now this is homemade cream cheese which I have made at home you can watch the recipe how to make cream cheese at home if you wish to basically it is a cream cheese substitute to be true next I'm going to add in 1/3 cup of powdered sugar to it and I'm going to beat this really well until it's all creamy and smooth so our cream cheese and sugar is all mixed up now going to activate our other agar so we're going to heat up a pan and we are going to add in the agar mixture which has been soaked up really well and it's all thick now try to get every bit out of it now in low flame we are going to cook this until it's all smooth and ready while on the other hand we are going to take some condensed milk which is 200ml condensed milk and going to heat it up until it's warm I had grinded up my agar agar flakes in the blender so that it gets smaller in size and gets melted really fast and our agar agar is well dissolved as well in the water or we must say it has been well melted now I am going to add the melted agar agar to the hot condensed milk now agar agar and gelatin both works differently if you are using gelatin you know you have to work little differently so I am adding agar agar here which works really well as well and now going to mix it really well and cook this for about 2 minutes you will see the condensed milk mixture getting thicker and thicker as it cools down we want to work with it when it's quite hot I mean when it's warm so we are going to just pour the mixture in but them to save it so I'm going to just pass it through a sieve now we want to whisk it really well and make sure you work with it while it's hot otherwise it will all get clumpy because other auger sets at room temperature so now going to whisk it really well until it's all smooth so this is getting super thick and it will set up really fast so I am going to just add other ingredients to it which includes three tablespoons of hazelnuts which I have roasted really lightly in a pan I have chopped up roughly and I'm adding to it here I have some blueberries these are dried blueberries and I have added some water and soaked it for about 12 hours and they have been rehydrated really well now I'm going to add in I took 3 tablespoons of this blueberries and soaked it so I'm going to add the berries so this shall be good I am going to take the Machine and give it a light world around you can add a little bit of this water if you wish to get that purplish color but totally optional it is so now I am going to take my whipped cream and add it it now I'm going to take a spatula and fold it we don't want to mix it anymore otherwise the cream will all lose the air that we incorporated in now it's the time to add some rescue Lezyne so here I have some mini rescuers which I'm going to add in don't add this before otherwise this will all get mashed up so I am to add a few of these so I've added about 25 of them I am to just fold it so a mix is all ready now I'm going to add all of it in here so now I am going to take a spoon and spread it all really well so our cake looks all ready now going to refrigerate this until it's all set so about 12 hours or so in the refrigerator not the freezer so then going to slice it up and then serve it so cheesecake is set in the refrigerator now I am going to just take a small knife and going to loosen the edges so now let's open it Wow looks delish so now let's serve it so I'm take a spatula or something that can just go inside and get this out so here I have a cake stand I'm going to just take the cake and place it on there by the way you can also serve this straightaway with the board in there but I am going to just take it out so you can decorate a cake as you wish I have taken some whipped cream and I'm going to just add it on top after that I'm going to place a furious glass on the edge I am also going to place hazelnuts on the other edge as well as angle top the cream with berries and a sprig of mint now here I have some of the blueberry water which I have just added two teaspoons of sugar and I have heated up until it's really thick now I am going to just add it to the edge a little bit it's time to slice it so our blueberry and rescuer cheesecake is all ready so let me try it this is just impeccable so make sure you try it and let

so fun to bring to you guys and this last one is a one of my favorites it seems extremely beautiful and delicious when you're serving it and seriously it takes some no time to put together it is a no bake cheesecake with awesome berries on top let's call it a triple berry cheesecake um that's amazing like so many awesome cheesesteaks we just put a few crushed graham crackers in the bottom I just like to throw them right into a ziploc bag and then take a rolling pin over the top make them into a fine crumb and then sprinkle them into the bottom of each container I'm using some clear glasses they're simple you can use anything you want you could use a bowl a tall champagne flute would be beautiful really anything you have to make an awesome presentation set the crumbs aside and you just want to start with the berries just take a few blueberries a few blackberries and some raspberries and put them right into a bowl I can mash them together with some sugar and some cassis which is a blackberry liqueur I know not everyone's going to have it a lot of different liqueurs would blend well with this limoncello would be good or any other fruit liqueur but if you want to leave it out don't worry just put a little bit of lemon juice in there just to add a little bit of brightness to it mash those together until they're really well blended everything is coming together and then put it in the rest of the whole berries this is a great presentation it makes almost like a quick little sauce and it just glazes them all and is delicious in a separate bowl you just want to whip up some cream you don't need to add anything to it because we will add sweetness little later whip it up tilt that stiff peaks and then in a separate bowl mix together some room-temperature cream cheese it will mix a lot better at room temperature some sour cream some sugar and lemon juice that lemon juice really just frightens the whole thing mix all that together until it's really well blended and there are no lumps if you're using cold products it's gonna be lumpy but if there are room temperature it's going to be smooth and delicious I'm just using a hand mixer but use whatever works for you once it is really well-mixed you can just fold in all of that whipped cream this really lightens it makes it fluffy and airy and um delicious I know I'm using the word delicious a lot but believe me it's worth it once that's folded in I like to put it right into a piping bag you don't have to do this you could spoon it in a bin if you're using a clear glass like I am it makes so the sides do not get dirty and if you're going to all this work you don't want to have an ugly presentation okay I know I'm a little bit over the top cut the end off of that piping bag and put it right into each glass just kind of eyeball it if it doesn't come out perfect don't worry you're just gonna give yourself the one at the most once it's all in there you can spoon the berry mixture evenly over each one I love how the juices drizzle down the sides and those berries are right on top seriously could this look any better I think everyone is going to ooh and office because it is so delicious serve it just like this or put it in the fridge and let it firm up a bit this is an amazing make-ahead dessert if you want to just keep the berries separate and then spoon them right over the top at the end I cannot wait for you guys to try this one and let me know how you liked it if you liked this video make sure to click like below and leave me a note and let me know how you are gonna make it hope you

little bit naughty you've got a love a dessert that hits all the marks let's make some blueberry cheesecake on the one pot show let's start by making the base for our cheesecake 200 grams of plain sweet cookies into a mixing bowl crushed up in the food processor or just in a bag and bashed up with a rolling pin will do I'll use scotch finger biscuits today if you're in the u.s. something like graham crackers if you're in the UK digestive biscuits will work just fine crush them up into the bowl I'm also gonna add in 80 grams of butter which i've just melted and just give that a stir to combine everything until it looks a bit like wet sand next I've got a 22 centimeter springform tin that's the one with the latch on the side so you can take the bottom off I've greased it and lined the base with some non-stick baking paper or parchment paper we're just gonna add our cookie mixture in and just using a flat-bottomed glass we're just gonna press the mixture down until it's nice and even all over and just place this into the fridge to chill while we work on our other ingredients to make our cheesecake mixture I'm gonna be using the food processor today but of course if you don't have a food processor you can do this in a big mixing bowl with an electric hand mixer so into the bowl of the food processor I've got 375 grams of cream cheese about one and a half packets to that I'm adding in three-quarters of a cup of caster sugar or superfine white sugar about 3/4 of a cup of cream I'm using whipping cream today about 160 Mills roughly a tablespoon of freshly grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and process that together until smooth next we're gonna add in three eggs one at a time and we're just gonna mix this up between each addition beautiful pour the cream cheese mixture onto the chilled base and I've got about 1 and 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries here you can use fresh as well but I frozen was just more convenient at the time we're just going to pour that over the top like so and just using a spoon I just want you to gently stir them around just to make sure they're nice and evenly distributed but also just to make sure they're all covered and this is ready to go into the oven preheated oven at 170 degrees Celsius for one hour when the Cheesecake comes out it will still have a bit of wobble in the center what I want you to do though is turn the oven off after one hour leave the door slightly open and just leave the Cheesecake in there to cool completely it should be about two hours or so it will take to cool once the cheesecake is baked and it has been allowed to cool in the oven all we need to do is place it into the fridge for about six to eight hours to chill once it's chilled and set we can decorate answer and here we have our completed blueberry cheesecake all I've done is put some fresh blueberries over the top and dust it with a little bit of icing sugar how gorgeous does this look and here we have a slice of our beautiful blueberry cheesecake it's absolutely stunning cannot wait to have a taste blue brizel through it YUM hmm oh wow better have another taste just in case mmm absolutely sensational mmm it's rich and sweet and creamy we got the background for the lemon and those beautiful exploding blueberries all through it and of course the blueberries on top it is absolutely gorgeous trust me it's not much work to put into this I mean really it's just a bit of mixing and pouring and shoving in the oven but believe you me this is a very impressive dish you bring this out to the table and everyone's gonna go oh well I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot check show calm and until next time see you later well I certainly hope you

without further ado let's get into it so far ingredients we're going to use cream cheese that is softened and at room temperature we're gonna have some sugar a little bit of flour some vanilla extract eggs some blueberry jam and for our crust we're going to be using graham crumbs and butter so we're just going to cream our cream cheese until it is all smooth and lump free and then we're going to slowly rein in our sugar and cream that together we want to add in our eggs which I forgot to mention should also be at room temperature and we're going to add it one by one and we're going to scrape

and sort of thickens up the matter now that our base cheesecake batter is ready we're going to take a couple tablespoons and mix it in with a couple tablespoons of blueberry jam we're just gonna stir this together so that we can Marble our cheesecake batter so we have to wrap the outside of the springform pan with some aluminum foil so I already made the crust it's just some melted butter mixed with some Graham crumbs and pressed into the bottom of a springform pan I'm using a six inch springform pan we're just going to pour in the base batter and add in spoonfuls of our blueberry cheesecake and then we're just going to continue layering on until all of the batter is in the Cheesecake pan we're gonna stir this together with a toothpick once your batter is all in your pan you want to make sure that you tap it against your countertop a couple times to remove any large air bubbles that might be there and we're going to put this whole thing into a water bath to bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and then we're going to turn down the temperature and bake for another 60 to 75 minutes [Music] you can tell it's done by the way the middle slightly jiggles and looks very set once it's good we can pull it out of the oven and then we're going to throw it into the fridge and let that sit there for a good eight to twelve hours before we take it out of our pan once we're taking it out of the pan you want to take a knife a paring knife and just run it along the edge of the pan to loosen its feel free to smooth out the sides of the Cheesecake using a mini pallet knife that is heated up in

hope everyone is having a great fourth of July weekend this week and we're going to do something a little special but I'm not going to say what it is right now and when I get through doing this easy budget-friendly recipe I'm going to be making some zucchini bread on my next video so let me get started on this recipe it's so simple that you just have to try it and it's good too so the first thing I'm going to do is put some cream cheese in [Applause] the next thing I'm going to do is something to put me in my Eagle Brand Milk [Applause] [Music] okay and the next thing I'm going to do is put in my all lemon juice that's 1/3 cup and then I'm going to put in on one teaspoon of vanilla flavoring I think I'm gonna try to get the rest of this out right quick [Music] let me turn this up you just mix all this up until it's good and creamy and put it in your own Concha and you let it sit in the refrigerator for about three hours and being when it's on set then I'm going to be putting this blueberry pie filling on top of it and you can also put it on cherry but the last time I made one I made the cherry one so huh make the blueberry win this time [Music] [Music] [Applause] I'll turn my beater off just for a minute and get this that stylus slide down the into my mixer [Music] [Music] that's good let me get a spinning out taster for you we got to make sure to sweeten that mmm that's good that's gonna be real good my cherry cream cheese styles are always good and they're so easy okay now then I'm gonna put my cream cheese in my pie pan like cream cheese mousse starting my own pie pinion I can smell that lemon and here also you know just want to smooth this out I hear the dogs bark honey yak can't do a video unless thinking bark they hadn't been barking last couple of days okay now then I'm gonna let this sit for about three hours and then I'll be backing out put this song see you in a little while I hi everyone I'm back in my cream cheese pie has been all I ever originally said to let it cook for about three hours but if it took a little longer and so on it's been in the refrigerator for about six hours and just have to let it stay in your refrigerator and on cool according to how your refrigerator all cools and make sure it's not jiggly and not it's not so now I'm gonna be putting on my own blueberry filling you know this is going to be our fourth of July pie Marie that really looks good I don't know if I can make it to do like the fourth mm-hmm I guess I'm gonna have to that well I believe you can work on that as a Keaney brand then I made today till then it sure has turned out pretty today while ago it was raining and cloudy I picked that snack in the refrigerator until the fourth here's my pile with my blueberry filling on it and it sure does look good and I could smell those blueberries and I can't wait to eat that yes but we gotta wait till the fourth but uh so do what you love and love what you do and y'all have a great evening bye [Music]", "3PU7vqTqQJY": "this is an easy no big blueberry cheesecake delicious creamy not overly sweet and made without any gelatine it comes with quick homemade blueberry sauce and no big old milk crust also it's made with low-fat cheese and no refined sugar and it's under 200 calories per slice lately I've been trying to lighten up my desserts using low-fat ingredients and without losing out on flavor I believe this one really worked and I think you'll like it so we're changing a few ingredients to make this cheesecake lighter while using less added sugar than average because of the cottage cheese this cheesecake is packed with protein and it's still creamy and just better for you my cottage cheese comes with a cheese liquid and its tiny grains of curd which you don't want in your cheesecake so first you're going to strain your cottage cheese and a few layers of cheesecloth to remove some extra moisture then transfer the cheese into a large bowl and blend until smooth and creamy see there's no tiny greens anymore anyway this no-bake cheesecake is pretty simple to make first make the crust in this case you need olds and walnuts which make a great alternative to no baked crust made with crackers finely chop or grind your walnuts or any nuts that you like in a food processor in a large bowl add quick cooking oats also some ground oats then previously chopped walnuts melted butter and honey that will make the mixture sticks together and also some water mix the crust using a fork or with your fingers until it starts to come together and it's crumbly if you find it too dry just add some more water for this cheesecake I'm using 8 inch springform pans so you can transfer the mixture and press the crust into your pan making sure you press it well with your fingers then put the crust in the fridge as you make the filling for the filling we're using a blended cottage cheese some honey for sweetness drop of vanilla extract a touch of freshly squeezed lemon juice and beat all the ingredients until smooth and no lumps remain now beat the cream until stiff using a very cold cream for best results this will hold the feeling together and make the Cheesecake real creamy then add the whipped cream and fall gently into the cream cheese mixture see how light and airy ds4 cream cheese filling into the chill crust and spread evenly using a spatula or the back of a spoon again put in the fridge until you make the blueberry topping this blueberry sauce can be made with fresh or frozen blueberries so you can enjoy it all year round also I use Chia to thicken the sauce and it works great with other fruits as well it's very easy to make and you need some blueberries maple syrup or honey freshly squeezed lemon juice some chia seeds water and cook everything for about 5 minutes on low medium heat until it reduces a bit you could substitute with blueberry pie filling but I really encourage you to make this on your own let it cool to room temperature and pour over the Cheesecake you don't want this blueberry sauce to be warm because it can melt the cheesecake for this recipe you don't need gelatine so you have to chill your cheesecake for at least 6 hours and do not put in the freezer or it will lose the texture run a thin knife around the pan to loosen the Cheesecake and remove the pan ring serve this no bake cheesecake cold because if it stays out for longer than 1 hour it might soften more than you want I recommend you eat a cheesecake as it is without any ice cream on side it's light in texture extra creamy and has the classic cheesecake flavor by the way if you need two cheesecakes this will be the perfect easy to make recipe you can prepare for family gatherings or dinner parties blueberries are so good in any dessert and this lemon blueberry love cake is not an exception it's super moist light and very delicious and made with good for you ingredients check out that recipe now thank you so much for watching see you in another video stay healthy stay happy", "kKSNKU7FqXQ": "now we're gonna make blueberry parfaits so we're gonna start with 16 ounces of cream cheese it's already been softened you can see when I push on it this is important because that all of our ingredients are softened a little bit warmer than room temperature so that everything will mix together correctly so now we're going to add a stick of real butter this is unsalted butter and you can see that it's softened as well next we're going to add a tablespoon of little cocktail maple syrup we're gonna add a teaspoon of real and finally we're gonna add about 25 drops of liquid stevia you can add more or less to your desired level of sweetness and what we're gonna do is mix this right up [Music] this is a good place to stop and check for the correct sweetness level and I want mine to be just a little bit sweeter so I added 20 more drops of stevia and now you have a nice fluffy cheesecake dessert now we're gonna make blueberry parfaits after the tablespoon of almond flour half of a teaspoon of your sweetener of choice we're just gonna stir that right up cheesecake [Music] down a bit this is an option if you want to have crust throughout it so if you like to have a little bit of that crumbly crust in between the layers just breeze down into the filling [Music] you [Music]", "uBj-NriY_pQ": "a really nice exciting quick

how to make because I love cheesecake but it was always so expensive so I wanted to learn how to make my own you know and I actually failed quite a bit which is actually kind of funny considering this such an easy recipe as long as you stick to a couple of basic things can't go wrong so so the very first thing we're gonna do is we've got we've got our mixer here you can do this by hand but it'll take you forever what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start throwing some cream cheese and this is room temperature cream cheese okay and I'm gonna start throwing this inside the mixer here and if you use room temperature it's it's gonna end up saving you some headache you can put cold in there but it's like I said it's a headache let's see what do we got we got three inside there and I'm gonna be making I'm gonna be making two of these I'm gonna go ahead and put one more in here what for cos I'm gonna be making with pre-made graham cracker crust you can make your own graham cracker crust alright I mean it's so easy you get graham crackers you smash them until they're a dust you pour maybe half a stick of melted butter in with it and then you shaped it into whatever you want and you bake it for about 20 minutes until it kind of looks like it's hardened up a little bit keeps the shape that it wants and then you've got your crust and then you go ahead and put it in at that point really easy so we've got four things of cheese here cream cheese and I use a generic there's no reason to go out and buy the expensive stuff well if I don't see why you would need to do that and once again I'm not using a measuring cup but this is gonna end up being about mmm a cup of sugar look for those better cup okay let's go ahead and cruise this down lock that in and turn this on low and let it start cleaning together here some people would probably put a little bit more sugar in it but I kind of like it when it's got a little bit of a tang like you can taste the sugar but it's got that tang and one of the reasons why we don't have to worry about the sugar too much is because we'll be putting a blueberry sauce on top of this we're going to kind of clean these things together we turn that guy off and at this point what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and we're going to add a container of sour cream some people will use half-and-half or they'll use heavy cream or they'll use milk and then what they'll do is they'll put some flour in here to kind of act as a thickener I'm not real crazy about that I don't like well I can't have flour I'm not technically supposed to even have dairy here's a little bit more sour cream this one is regular sour cream and you can tell that it's not as running the light sour cream honestly the only reason why that's in there it's because when I bought it I didn't know it was like I would have just got regular sour cream but ain't gonna hurt nothing it's not gonna hurt nothing let's go ahead and turn this back on let that mix and while that's going on I'm gonna take four eggs and only put four eggs inside here these are some pretty fragile shells and part of me thinks that I should probably put these in glass or something first to make sure I don't get any shell inside the cake but I think I'm gonna be okay when I was at the store and I was picking up the sour cream there was a really hot chick I saw inside there she was standing behind me in line partners like you know if I was younger attractive and not married and whatnot I would totally ask you to come over had some cheesecake cutes they'll turn me down because he's lactose-intolerant I'm sure we're going to be putting some pure vanilla extract inside this and this is not artificial this is like for real and you only need to put about a couple cap holes the way that we go ahead and we do the lemon is we have what's known as a micro rasp or a micro file and we just take our lemon and we kind of go over we don't want to get the pith in there and the pith is the white part we're just trying to take the yellow part on the outside off this contains a lot of lemon scent and the lemon oils and it actually makes a difference so you go ahead and you just kind of do this and this is what some people would refer to as zesting a lemon to me zesting sounds like you're using soap on it you know zestfully clean when you're picking out lemons so we want to take some of this destined one throw it when you're picking out lemons you're picking out limes you're doing anything like that you should always pick them up and make sure that they feel heavy for their size because I'll tell you that there's a lot of juice in them nothing worse than buying a damn lemon or a lime and there ain't nothing in it shits all dry so we got our our lemon zest in there we're gonna turn this back on again we're gonna get this all stirred up a little bit there we go so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna get this and we're gonna put it inside the pie crust so at this point this is where you want to go ahead and pour your bacon fat inside there okay that's a joke you don't don't do that that probably a very bad thing to do okay but I'm taking I'm taking a spatula silicone spatula kind of knocking down the sides here of the bowl just to try to get everything mixed up and we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna pour this in we're gonna leave a little bit of room for the blueberries if I can get over here it's kind of hard for me to do this with the camera in the way but we want this to almost be full but when you to make sure we get room for the blueberries okay that's not bad well anyway I'm gonna go ahead and let these guys kind of sit here while the oven is warming up with the water in it and then I'm gonna put these in the oven you just end up putting like casserole dish like this with water in it it's basically just trying to keep the humidity level in the oven at a decent level so we're gonna put this at 350 it's gonna take anywhere from maybe an hour and you actually it's anywhere from like 45 minutes to like maybe like an hour and 15 minutes but you can just figure maybe about an hour and what we're gonna be looking for is when the top of the cheesecake is starting to look a little Brown like a little lightly golden and also it's set and generally I'll use the toothpick technique just like with any other cake generally I'll do that so now it's the waiting game grab a couple of toothpicks here and what I want to do is I want to see if when I stick this in if it comes out wet okay and because I'm doing this just like a regular cake that one is still wet okay so this one is a little wet still this one is just a little wet so I'll clean this back in I'm gonna let it go for maybe another 15 minutes and then I'll test it again so now that our cheesecake is done and it's been refrigerated we're gonna go ahead and start with the topping and put this on that medium heat there's a pack of blueberries it doesn't have to be organic or anything but these are the only ones that they had available and I'm gonna put a touch of salt and when I say a touch I literally mean like a touch like barely anything like that we're gonna add some sugar I'm not really measuring because I base it on the amount of blueberries that I can kind of see here and the ones that I can't really see so in other words it's like I think of it like if I could put a good coating of sugar on each blueberry just enough that would stick on each blueberry that's kind of like how much I'm putting inside here I can always add more but I don't even know how sweet these berries are naturally so I I'm kind of taking a step back here just put in an initial amount because I don't really want to overdo it so this is the lemon that we had zest it and I'm gonna kind of put my hand here make sure no seeds get in this and it looks like I'm not gonna have a problem with the seeds okay but I want to put the juice of a lemon in here about a cap full of vanilla extract now I'm doing this while it's cold so it doesn't clump up okay but something along those lines and now I'm gonna stir it up so we don't get clumps okay if you try to do that mmm in this while it was hot you didn't have getting like little balls of corn star so we're getting a little bit closer to what we're looking for now what we want to do is we we definitely want this to start seeing some bubbles we want to see it simmer and stuffs because we don't know if this is gonna be enough cornstarch okay now at this point the blueberries should have opened up and then the cells should be releasing a bunch of their juices in the water and all sorts of good stuff and everything should get softened and you're gonna see now that this has become a little bit more thick this is almost like a syrup at this point I'm gonna turn this down just a little bit at this point if you wanted to you could use this for syrup for your blueberry pancakes like if you're making pancakes in the morning you can make your own blueberry syrup like this do the exact same thing use blackberries use raspberries whatever you can do that and you can make all sorts of really cool syrups for your for your pancakes but this is I want this to be a little thicker okay so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to take some cornstarch and mix it with some water so right here I've got some cold water and some Colts and some cornstarch and I'm mixing it up like this so that way it becomes basically just like a legally if I try to go straight in here right now it would just clump up okay and this isn't really what I'm looking for so what I'm going to do is I'm going to stir this at the same time as I'm putting in this water and cornstarch until it gets to the thickness that I want I don't want to pour it all in at the same time because if I do I might end up with something that's very similar to jello I mean wait for this to get back to temperature because after this cools it's gonna thicken up some more okay so when it has the proper thickness here that means when it cools it's gonna be thicker okay but this is looking pretty good when I pick it up yeah this is looking pretty good okay and it's see how it's sticking to the spoon real good okay so I'm gonna call that good this is gonna start thickening up even more and within the next five minutes ten minutes it's gonna be like glue inside this pan so I've refrigerated the Cheesecake already I'm gonna wait for a couple of minutes so this one's not completely boiling and then I'm gonna pour this on top of the cheesecakes so what we're gonna do is I'm stirring up this blueberry sauce and it is it is hot you can let this cool down a little bit more if you wanted to but what I want to do is I want to pour some on top on both of these okay and try to get both of them to have equal amounts of the topping and this stuff right here I got there's actually a really killer thing that you can do with this don't put it in the sink what you do is you put some vodka inside there some rum you swirl it around until it absorbs all of that that blue kind of cleans it up and you have a nice little blueberry shot so you'll see about how much vodka I put in here maybe a quarter of a cup and I'm just gonna end up stirring this up and trying to infuse that blueberry sauce with the vodka so I'm gonna take my good old fashioned whatever the hell you call this it's a glass right I'm gonna pour my blueberry vodka inside here and I've got some blueberry lemonade here and I'm gonna put inside there so let's see if this is any good that's pretty damn good we're gonna go ahead and pop the lids on and put it back inside the refrigerator until it is time to get diabetes all right so it's been refrigerating for a little bit my nephew said he's up for a slice all right all right key all right son of a [ __ ] Oh get the thingamabob er sorry air spray pinch it off you can hang on for a second all right so that's what it looks like when you don't know how to cut it with the dam but from the side at least here you can kind of see what we got going on that doesn't look too shabby from the side I just shouldn't use this knife to cut it but anyway go ahead and go in there with him is this supposed to be a lemon you put lemon zest inside it because there's always a little lemon flavor - cheesecake is usually a vanilla lemon flavor damn there's a way that can taste a lot of lemon on it but like oh it's like really good it's not overly sweet nope this is a really [ __ ] good cheesecake like all right I only like original but this is like this is original Noah but I think this is better than we can get at Cheesecake Factory and [ __ ] you know uh-huh I've never eaten there yes it's a [ __ ] terrible places so it's overly priced and only [ __ ] rich [ __ ] go there because some people like it sweeter I like it where it's got a little bit of tang to it like where it's got a little bit of yeah but anyway guys that's how I go about making my cheesecake and it's real easy as you saw and I mean it's like I didn't you know I wasn't sitting there with measuring cups or anything like that he's still working on it but you can see it's not runny or nothing it looks right but yeah maybe one these days I'll end up doing one of like a chocolate cheesecake or something I will see what happens but those two those two were for my wife and my nephew so they got plenty of stuff to stop their heart for the next few days anyway guys till next time I will talk to you later", "575udvm-Kb8": "when you're faced with an impossible decision like deciding between two of the world's greatest desert well is massive together blueberry cheesecake doughnuts unlike an old-fashioned traditional doughnut which is long time consuming and involves yeast this is super easy to stir it all together sucked need 150 grams of sour cream and a hundred grams of butter melted and whispered to let's move and once it is smooth you're gonna add two eggs and 175 grams of caster sugar that's less than you get in a regular diner so it's not healthy but it's healthier now for the dry ingredients to make a doughnut that feels as rich and dense but still light enough to be delicious we use a cover self-raising and half a cup of plain flour plus a little bit of bicarb soda sift them together before you add them it's really important so it mixes through properly [Music] which end up with is something like I guess is better but that's ok because they're actually using a great little shortcut donut baking tins so add some frozen blueberries make sure they are frozen otherwise it gets a bit mushy then pop it in [Music] [Music] at 180 degrees they're gonna need about 18 to 20 minutes just to they golden and firm to touch meanwhile you know how I told you that the basic doughnuts themselves are healthier well that's before we get to the I see I mean let's be honest to recap some icing sugar getting a packet of cream cheese look it's not healthy poop that's delicious so put those in your stand mixer with a little bit of vanilla you're gonna play the tune really like meanwhile for the glaze delivery jam the squeeze lemon juice [Music] once the donuts have called pipe the cream cheese frosting over the top then some fresh blueberries and mix that into the glaze it sneaks a bit of fruit crunchy spin that over the top and that of absolutely fantastic it's great color they're really presentable I love this they delicious the elegant it's the perfect mashup of term your favorite desserts blurry cheesecake doughnuts [Music]", "fJyJ0JVJoS0": "hello everyone today we'll be making the no bake blueberry cheesecake first we have to dissolve white and flavored gelatin and a half cup of water second we'll be melting our butter third we have to put our crush grams in a plate or a bowl for it we're going to combine the melted butter into our crushed gray humps and mix it and mix it thoroughly until it looks like this yeah this one fifth we're going to put the crushed grapes with butter on our pan and flatten it out like this six we have to combine our all-purpose cream and condensed milk and just stir it well I got my little helper here my baby so just say hi to her hi there seven we have our cream cheese and board cream cheese this is the most cheapest cream cheese I've found in the market so we have to combine it on our liquid ingredient and just mix it next we have the beat our egg next we have to put our liquid ingredient in a pan because we have to boil it once it boils just add the unflavored gelatin and mix it well and then just turn off the fire this time we're going to add the beaten egg and mix it well until it's combined now on our plastic pan with the crushed grams just add the liquid ingredients and do it like this flatten it out so for our final stuff we're gonna go to our blueberry jam I heated the blueberry jam because it was ice cold earlier so after that just put it on top and flatten it out you can also use the blueberry pie filling that's gonna look much better so after we flatten it it should look like this and don't forget guys that you need to refrigerate it for a couple of hours maybe three to five hours it depends to you so it tastes good thank you so much guys for watching this is our no big blueberry cheesecake I hope this will help thank you bye", "La346sqwdPU": "think we'll be nice with some blueberries as well I think I've got some in the fridge do I have some blueberries yeah I got some food [Laughter] [Music] hey guys this guy's and welcome back to my youtube channel today I have a really nice suite on the menu and it is raw peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake that's right there's no cooking involved whatsoever is actually no refined sugar in there either and it's made in about half an hour and we get it in the freezer and you can tuck into it whenever you want over like the space of three months it's really great it's really handy so first up let's make the base I've just lined this loose bottom cake tin it's really handy and important that you have a loose bottom cake tin it just makes it easy to get the Cheesecake out basically so that's the loose bottom cake tin which I just lined with some grease proof baking paper the base mainly consists of dates and so first up into the blender I'm adding a cup and a half of pitted dates get those in I'm also going to add one cup of mixed nuts which I've just ground up basically you can literally just throw everything in and blend it up I'm also adding two tablespoons of melted coconut oil and the tiny bit of vanilla bean paste don't need to add any sweeteners because obviously the dates are really really sweet let's pop the lid on and get this blitzed up [Applause] so once that's blended up it should almost come look like it's combined together that's just because the dates are sticky and there's a bit of coconut oil in there that's a perfect but feel free to get adventurous with your base you can add chocolate in there you can add more nuts or different types of nuts and yeah let's get it in using a spatula just press it in you want to make it as level as possible using the bottom of a glass also helps you're just using the glass to level it out I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I make sure that it's really really level as soon as you got it to this stage we just need to pop it in the freezer and get the fill-in meat right it's time to drain off these cashew nuts I've got two and a half cups which I've just soaked in water for about two hours you can do that overnight and it makes it a lot easier but I've just used hot water which speeds up the process now let's drain this through a colander and get them blitzed up so I'm just going to give these a little pat dry and me being me I don't like to do things that easy way so I'm gonna do this cheesecake and have the chocolate on the bottom and I'm gonna have the peanut butter flavor on the top which means we have to freeze chocolate first and then add the peanut butter flavor after so to make things easy for myself I've got two ninja cups and I'm going to split the cashew nuts in half in each of them so there should be about a cup and a quarter in each try not to get them everywhere like me just make sure they're level basically they look about level to me so let's get the rest of the filling ingredients in there the next step let's get some lemon juice in there and I've just got one lemon which I've got gonna cut in half and squeeze it through my hand half in one and half in the other next I'm going to add three tablespoons of maple syrup I've got a quarter of a cup of almond milk so half a cup in total I'm also going to add coconut milk for the creaminess and just a good little tip if you just open it upside down now that we've got the lid off we can get the water out and it will just reveal the cream and then get half of it in this one and half of it in that one there's a little tip for you using the coconut cream just adds real creaminess that you cake after all there's no cheese beyond in there so we need to need to replicate that creamy texture I'm also going to add a touch of vanilla to each one now a very important ingredient is coconut oil and that just helps set the Cheesecake and I'm going in with just under half a cup in each one okay so for the peanut butter flavor we need to get some peanut butter and I have a tablespoon going in make sure you use a really good-quality peanut butter this is actually my homemade peanut butter and the recipe is actually in my book so make sure you pre-ordered the book and it's full of amazing recipes just like this one and in the other ninja cup obviously the chocolate flavor and I've got raw cacao powder going in just 2 tablespoons so next we need to blend it and the chocolate layer first because that's going into the Cheesecake first and whilst this blending I'm gonna go and get the base out with the freezer it's always worth giving that little shake making sure it's well combined because we need to make sure that is really really smooth so the base is just about set it's been in the freezer only since the time I'll be making this and that's fine I'm gonna get a creamy chocolate filling on top I'm sorry if you can hear rains happen on the roof it's such a horrible day in London today I need to get back to Wales so simply pour in this really creamy chocolate filling spread it out evenly make sure it's nice and level don't waste any get it all in there look how creamy and shiny that looks looks absolutely beautiful and just a little tip if you have made any marks like here just give them a wipe off because it will just mess up the presentation so it's now time to pop this in the freezer for at least an hour or into this just set and then we'll pour this over once it's blitzed up so whilst the chocolate layer is freezing I'm just going to blitz up the peanut butter layer and when it's set we're gonna get this on top that's good for me I really love the sort of peanut butter running through it the little speckles it just adds a nice look to it and it's gonna look amazing on top of the cheesecake so the chocolate layer is just set I'm just gonna pour over the peanut butter layer really carefully look how creamy that looks again fill it right up don't waste any use a spatula or a spoon to get the rest of it out and just smooth it off make sure it's nice and level and then let's get this in the freezer for around three hours that will be enough time to make sure it's set right through but just make this the day before serving really that's what I recommend I'm going to get this in the freezer now I'm going to see what it's like when it's set guys I've literally just got this out of its mold just a little tip for you I didn't show you it on camera unfortunately but if you're struggling to get it out of the mold just get a hot kitchen towel and just wrap it round the outside of the ring and it'll pop out really easily but what I'm going to do is well to garnish it because it looks a bit playing at the moment but you can see the nice two layer we've got the peanut butter and the chocolate at the bottom it looks really nice there and I've just mixed up some raw chocolate you can just go crazy with this chocolate you can do drizzles over the top or I'm gonna try and go slightly fancy I don't know whether I'm gonna regret this because it's quite difficult doing it especially when the cameras are on you but I'm going to go just round the sides and just do some nice droplets hopefully that looks nice your side after all this is really chocolatey anyway so you don't actually need this but it will look really cool usually when I do my Instagram pictures I take ages doing this but this is probably the quickest I've ever put chocolate on a cheesecake like this before let's just have a look at this I'm gonna make sure that these drizzles around everywhere this is looking absolutely great already imagine serving that to your guests but I'm gonna put some really nice fresh berries on top of it so to serve on top I'm gonna put some really nice fresh berries and I'm gonna cut the strawberries in just in half I think I've got some raspberries I've got some cherries and obviously the strawberries I'm just gonna put these around the side I'm not gonna be too neat I'm just going to go around a mix of the creamy cheesecake and the fresh berries works really nicely got some raspberries to go on it's always good just to spin it round make sure it's looking really nice from all the angles and to me that is looking lovely finally the fresh mint leaves as I said in my Dispatch field video I always present in odd numbers they just look better to the eye I think so I'm just going to add a few more sprigs of mint and there it is that's my peanut butter and chocolate raw cheesecake perfect in the summer with fresh berries raw chocolate and it's got a really nice date and nuts crumb base it's gonna be absolutely amazing I can't wait to cut into it actually I don't know whether I want to because it looks too perfect but it's just beautiful I can't wait to try it [Music] so I resisted the temptation of eating it before the guys had finished getting the beauty shots but just heated up this knife or just put it in some hot water and it just makes it easier when cutting through so there's no simple way to do it other than just get them involved and press in into the cake what I recommend is taken out of the freezer and put it in the fridge around about 2 hours before serving it get another big slice this cake actually serves around 12 to 14 people because it is really filling obviously it's full of nuts and there we have it I could have cut it a bit neater but it looks great and I give it try it's really really creamy oh wow you first you get a bit the peanut and then you get the chocolate and you get the really sweetness of the date is so so nice it's really rich Pat full of flavor and it's so sweet as well which is great because there's no refined sugar in there and yeah that is a wonderful dessert it serves 12 to 14 people and can be kept in the freezer for about three months please make this and if you do make it make sure you tag me in a picture on instagram at avant-garde vegan pre-order my book now vegan 100 on Amazon there's the mach front cover it's gonna be a little bit more work done so I think but it's a good start I can't

one serving of bluerays which is about a handful has about four grams of fiber and just 80 calories and we're going to be serving our mini cheesecakes in these forearms little mason jars so it's great because you can portion them out this way and you can individualize them they're perfect for after lunch or even for a quick dessert on the go as just mentioned this is vegan instead of using regular

really yummy and this is my mini blueberry cheesecake so with the ingredients eight ounces of cream cheese this is 250 grams 2 eggs 1/2 a cup of graham cracker crumbs 1 cup of fresh blueberries one teaspoon of vanilla four tablespoons of butter and I'm using salted butter in this recipe 1/3 of a cup of regular white sugar and half a cup of sour cream so those are the ingredients let's get started so for our first step I've taken my butter and just melted it in the microwave we've got our graham cracker crumbs here I'm just going to dump that in there and we'll just stir that around we just want to mix this ok that's nicely mixed I have a springform pan here and this is a six inch pan right here I'll just zoom out a little bit so you can see a little better there we go all right and we're simply just going to take this and dump this in here now if you want a thicker base crust you can simply just double this recipe so instead of using 1/2 of 1/2 a cup of graham crackers you can use a cup I'm going to take the bottom of a glass and I'm just going to push it all down and make it nice and even okay that's perfect so we'll just put this to the side while we make our filling now we're going to start on our filling so we have our block of cream cheese that's our 8 ounces or 250 grams I'm going to pour in all of our regular white sugar grab my beater I'm just going to start mixing that up I want to cream these together okay this is about 30 seconds later and I'll pop in my first day so what that is going to do it's going to loosen this up and then we're going to really be able to really cream this and then our next egg and when this is in the oven and it's actually baking the eggs are you know what helps the whole mixture solidify so that when you're cutting into it it doesn't all fall apart on you okay and then our teaspoon of vanilla extract and I'm using pure vanilla extract always use pure if you can it's available to you and it's just so much better than the artificial stuff you can't even compare it and then we have our sour cream to add in okay I'll get all the sour cream there we go okay we'll mix that in okay that looks good and then I'm going to get all of our beautiful fresh blueberries in there and at this point I'm going to just mix them I don't care if some of them break open because that will just impart a nice little blueberry flavor throughout the actual cheesecake so there we go that's good and that is the filling and we are ready to go okay we've got our mold just like that so now we're just going to get all of our lovely filling right into our springform pan and there we go perfect okay and I'm just going to put this onto a pizza plate just like that and now into my 350 degree oven I'll bake this off I'll come back and I'm going to tell you exactly how long I baked it so off to the oven and I'll see you later so my cheesecake came out of the oven about 20 minutes ago I baked it for a total of 60 minutes okay and right now quite hot but I am going to take a chance we'll just open this up I already took my little spatula and just went down just like that just before I started the camera I just wanted to make sure that it was it was nice there we go and then I'm just going to lift it off just to show you very gently and there we go beautiful so at this point right now I'm going to put this back on and I'm going to pop this into the fridge and I am going to let this just chill for five six hours something like that then I'll come back we'll unmold it for real and we're going to do something on the top and then we'll finish the video I wish you could smell this it smells really really good okay so I'll be back later alright so my cheesecake has been in the fridge oh good seven hours I'd say so I just want to take my spatula once again just go all the way around make sure that everything is good and then we'll open it up and there we go YUM that looks really really good really really nice here I'll just spin it around just to show you there we go so I just zoomed in a little bit and I just want to cut into this now so we'll just get right down do a nice slice just like that and then another slice okay I'm just going to remove my little base here there we go we did have our parchment paper under there that'll just make it a little easier for me to remove my slice and there we go and look at that turn it on a plate I'll turn a cheesecake around so we can see what's inside and don't worry I will zoom in let me just do that now okay I'm just zoomed in a little bit I just wanted to show you a little closer up and there we go I wish you could smell this it smells really really good as soon as I cut into that you just get this burst of blueberry really really nice and there we go so at this point now what could you do you can put some whipped cream on here you can do some little you know berries whatnot what I have here is I have a nice compote Daboo it okay this is fresh blueberries with a little bit of sugar and some lemon juice and at this point now I'm just going to take this I'm just going to spoon it on there just like that just let it drip down the sides and there we go beautiful I'll post a link to this video if you're interested in seeing how I made that but there we go so there is my mini blueberry cheesecake with cone PO W wet I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time let's try this oh that's good oh that is really really good you", "HUIUKnweuv8": "this is a blueberry cheesecake and this is absolutely delicious now recently when I made the blueberry pancakes I had several people say to me would you make a blueberry cheesecake well it's Tuesday Tuesday so today we're going to make this mini blueberry cheesecake come on what are you waiting for so we're going to start by making a simple blueberry sauce just going to put a cup of blueberries into a pan half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of water now you're just going to bring this up to a simmer and then you'll see all the berries start to pop and burst open and release their beautiful flavors now it's the sugar start to dissolve the fruits are going to burst open and release all their flavor what I want to do is get this up to a little simmer and let it simmer for about ten or fifteen minutes to allow all the pecked into a release and the sugars to become thick enough to get a nice thick sauce now for my cheesecakes we're making these beautiful little four-inch rounds if you want to make an 8-inch round just double the recipe I'm using here I've taken four ounces of graham crackers pop them into a ziplock bag you and put them into a food processor and I'm just going to break them up now you can use a rolling pin or whatever but we want this to be like a fine sand pour your Sandy cracker mix into a bowl and we need to bind this together so I've got two ounces that's about 50 grams of melted butter and then just mix this together until you get what looks like a wet sand then we're just going to divide the mixture up into my two little tins and then I'm just going to use the bottom of a clean glass just to pack this down nice and flat now here's a quick tip if you like a little bit of spice to your biscuit you could put some cinnamon or nutmeg or a little bit of ginger in the base of these and it really tastes great now I'm going to set these in the fridge just till they firm up now whilst they said we're going to whip up a quick cheesecake filling just come down here I have a nine ounce 250 gram block of softened cream cheese in a bowl to that I'm going to add half a cup of powdered sugar and I just want to use a spoon to cream this together until it's nice and smooth so into our sweet cream cheese we're just going to add about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just blend it in next we want some whipped cream if you take about a third of a cup of heavy whipping cream and we just want to whisk this up until it's stiff now we'll take that nice thick whipped cream and pop it in with our cheese and then just mix that in till you get a nice smooth texture now I don't want to break these blueberries up but I'm going to take half a cup and just pop them in our cheesecake mix and then gently fold them through now let's take those two bases out of the fridge and then we're going to take this cheesecake mix and just pop it into our cheesecake molds and then just push the cheesecake into the corners and flatten down the cheesecake mix and let's just pop these in the fridge for an hour or so to firm up so we've produced this beautiful blueberry sauce with great big lumps of blueberry in it we have our little cheesecakes out of the fridge what I'm going to do just going to run a knife around the inside just to release it from the tin undo the spring and hopefully our little blueberry cheesecake is going to pop out fairly easily and because the base is nice and buttery it's not even going to stick to the dish just pop that onto a plate now even on its own that's a beautiful little cheesecake but we're going to take it up a notch with our blueberry sauce now I don't know how much of this I'm going to put on to be honest you might have to tell me when to stop let's just pour that on there so what do you think a couple of spoonfuls and a little extra of the sauce so there you have it blueberry cheesecake I'm going to tuck in and give this a try just come in here and take a little look I want to go through the cheesecake and through that beautiful biscuit base here goes Wow that is just absolutely delicious if you love blueberries that you're going to love this blueberry cheesecake if you decide to make it please share the love give this one a thumbs up and tell me what you think don't forget there are lots and lots of recipes on Steve's kitchen and if you have any ideas you can always comment down below and if there's enough interest in it I'll make it on a Tuesday Tuesday so I'll see you next time be good what are you waiting for hit that share button down below and share this out with your friends I'm sure they'd love to make this cheesecake at home it's so simple I'll leave some links up here to some other videos in the meantime I'm going to get on and enjoy myself for the cheesecake", "V2mYybbq7U8": "you know welcome to Todd's kitchen who doesn't love a good cheesecake recipe everyone love them it doesn't matter what time of the year it is and there's no simpler cheesecake than a no-bake cheesecake so join me today as I make my version of a no-bake blueberry cheesecake not with any good cheesecake we're going to start by doing our base so I've got a packet of chocolate cookies and what I've done is I've just run it through a food processor now we don't have a food processor just put it into a ziplock bag and bash it seal it with a rolling pin just to get these sort of a crumb stage so it's going to place this into a ball now these cookies have white chocolate chips in them if you want about the white bits but it's completely up to you what type of cookies you want to use aunt I'm going to pour in our melted butter now a will leave a list of ingredients in the description so now we're just going to mix it around just until that butter and the cookies are completely combined okay so next I have a spring form pan and I'm just lining the base with some non-stick baking paper so with some cooking spray oil just give it a quick grease and we're just going to place our mixture into the pan so just use the back of spoon just even it out next we're with the base of a cup we're just going to compact the base down just a little even and nice and firm okay now that's nice to compact it we're going to place this in the fridge to set or I get started on the rest of the cheesecake okay so next we're going to use some blueberries you can use it fresh or you can use a frozen it really makes a difference for this stage whatsoever okay so what I'm going to do now is place them into a food processor you can also do this in a blender it's completely up to you okay so using a food processor or a blender we're going to blend them or process them until they come to a nice view right okay so I've got about a half a cup of water here and 40 grams all about four tablespoons of gelatine now we can't use gelatine for certain reasons there are alternatives like a jar so this half a cup of cold water we're just going to sprinkle in our gelatine it's going like that for about 10 minutes to soak up the water and soften that's about 10 minutes just stick in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds and stir it each time until it's dissolved okay so next into a mixing bowl I'm going to place in 400 grams of softened cream cheese then one cup of thickened cream or heavy cream or double cream whipping cream and then one cup of sugar okay so now we're going to mix this through until it's well combined and nice and creamy okay now that everything is mixed together going to grab our blueberry puree then we get all out and place that into the pot and we're going to mix our own tools walking by it okay so as you can see there's now nicely mixed in so I've just taken our gelatin mixture out of the microwave on my pointer for about 45 seconds then go to good stir so it's completely dissolved so now we're just going to slowly pour it into our mixture and that will make sure you have a nice firm cheesecake okay so once it's all mixed in we can stop the missing so now we're just going to simply pour our cheesecake mixture onto the base they are fine it's pretty runny the moments but don't worry about it that's what the gelatin is for it'll make that nice and firm okay so all we have to do now is simply place this in the fridge they want to put in there for four to six hours but preferably overnight just to give it a good chance to set okay so our cheesecake is set in the fridge and we're just going to make up some topping so I have some thickened cream in a bowl here I'm just going to whip that up until soft peaks at the form okay so we now have some soft peaks so it's now I'm going to add about a quarter

while pretty spoon of salt one cup of bread flour and 2/3 cup of warm water to begin combine the sugar and the warm water give it a mix and then we will add the yeast again the yeast is 78m grams 4 is 2 and 1/4 teaspoon of yeast we will Metis it until it bubbles up just like this about 5 minutes and then we will combine the salt and the bread flour give it a mix well and then we will add the yeast mixture to this give it an egg until it is well combined and then we're going to copy this with cling wrap and let it rest until it doubles in size about an R so my dough is ready we got one egg 60 grams of melted butter half a cup of sugar 2/3 cup of milk 3 cups + 2 tbsp of bread flour so we're going to combine the milk the butter if you don't have a stand mixer you can use your hands to knead the dough the egg just slightly up break the egg now we can add the yeast dough now we're going to side-scrolling meetings gonna add the sugar now we're ready to add the flour don't add the flour all at once because it's easy to UM correct this by adding flour a little time then dumping all the flour and then finding out that tray dough is too dry so I added half of my uncle our first and then I gonna need it and once all the flour is a source we can add some more flour again my flour is three cups plus two tablespoons so I'm leaving the two tablespoon and have a look at my dough first before I add my final flour so here I know that I needed to tablespoon of the Flies my added in and now once your dough is ready we can knead this for about six to eight minutes after eight minutes the dough is ready just like these gonna stop the kneading process and then I have a bowl with a little bit of oil on it you see they're just gonna form our dough into a ball just like this and then we will roll the ball into the oil and then we're going to cover this with cling wrap again and we're going to let this press in a one spot for about an hour or until it doubles in size after an hour our dough has doubled in size so I spread a little bit of flour on my up work surface and then using a rolling pin I'm gonna roll the dough about a quarter of an inch thick or it could be thicker the thickness really depends on how thick you want your dough to be I've got a round cookie cutter and then I'm just cutting circles of dough and then I just kind of move this into my prepared baking pan lined with parchment paper and then you just use all the dough and here's what they should look like I'm trying to put them close together so when they rise they would stick together that's the look I'm going for but you can do like separate ones and now we're going to let this rest again for about 30 to 45 minutes or until it's Reiter's and doubles up for the filling we need one side a plus one tablespoon of sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon of vanilla this is blueberry pie filling you can make from scratch and one block of cream cheese which is 250 grams so I'll open up my can this is what it should look like if you don't want to use blueberry pie filling you can use Jam now to make best cream cheese filling so I'm just breaking up my cream cheese I added the sugar [Music] make sure that your cream cheese is at room temperature so it's easier to mix and then I'm going to add the milah and then the egg mix until it is well combined and now we just kind of put this in the fridge while we move on to the next step with this too so um it's optional we need 1 tablespoon of sugar and that's well fresh cup of flour and then this is about 25 grams of cold butter but then we just kind of mix it together and until it forms like a crumble just like this set it aside as well for now our dough has doubled in size now I've have a bottle that I cover it with a clean rag and I'm putting an impression in the middle of the dough to make like holes in the center that is where we're going to put our filling try not to knock the air on the side and now with one beaten egg we're just gonna put egg wash on the sides you don't need to put egg wash in the middle and once we're done I'm putting egg wash on the side we're gonna let this rest for 15 minutes after 15 minutes we're ready to put a cream cheese filling don't overfill them after the cream cheese filling now we're going to add the blueberry pie filling so we don't like feeling there are so many options that you can do for the filling but this is not very traditional feeling that I'm using here you can use just jam farmer's cheese or apricot jam and then after this we're going to put the Anne streusel and then we will bake these in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about 13 to 15 minutes or until the top is golden brown and this is what it looks like after baking now I've got melted butter here about 20 grams then I'm quickly brushing the top side of my arm kolache this will soften up the top and this is the finish brother I hope you give them a try cuz this bread is so good I can guarantee that you're gonna love this and you could show me the photos of your finish work on my facebook page oh I promise you're gonna love this and it's so easy to make really just to show you what it looks like inside

"jVx5fVmFbEc": "hey guys once upon a time I had this idea that I was gonna make culture to vegan cream cheese from scratch and make a luscious authentic cheese cake for you guys this rich decadent blueberry cheesecake isn't that cake it's super easy and won't take you a week or so of culturing you're just gonna grab a few things from the store and throw into a blender and then into a pan and then into the oven we start with the liquidy stuff so it'll be closer to the blades vanilla because of course and lemon juice to replicate the tang of dairy cheese then a cup of cashews they've been soaking in water for four hours or more and blend it until it's super duper smooth if you have to add a couple of tablespoons of water to get it to blend smooth then view it I'm adding a little bit more lemon juice because I didn't plan this video out I just winged it then dump in a carton of deya or tofutti cream cheese will this work with homemade cultured stuff I don't know yet let me know if you try it before I do gotta have sugar because this is a cake don't confuse veganism with being on a diet because those are two different things and then blend until that's smooth and that's it for the cheesecake filling onto the crust I'm using graham crumbs that happen to be vegan friendly that I bought from bulk barn most graham crackers do have honey in them so watch out for that when you go to buy yours or get crumbs like me or you can crush your choice of cookie and use that instead I'm just mushing in two tablespoons of vegan butter and once that's totally blended up press the crumbs into your baking tin of choice this one is 5 inches by 9 inches I also lined it with parchment paper for easy cleanup afterwards when you have your crumbs firmly press down and even pour in your cream cheese mixture you could bake that as is or grab some blueberries and sugar and heat that up in the microwave for a minute or just bring it to a boil on the stove and then you have your blueberry mixture ready to mix some swirlies they're beautiful save any leftover blueberry stuff for serving afterwards bake your cake in a preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes until the top is looking golden brown and then let it cool stick it in the fridge for a couple of hours before you slice it up this cheesecake is super rich and decadent and it tastes so good so super simple even if you think you can't bake you can make this vegan cheesecake I promise so does it taste like actual dairy cheesecake I don't know I haven't had that stuff in like five years so it but my non-vegan boyfriend said the texture is really spot-on though it's a little less hanging than the dairy stuff some you decide thank you so much for watching guys I hope you liked this quick kind of casual video please give it a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe if you haven't already for new easy vegan recipes each week bye for now", "Z0EKbd67Cyw": "If you love light and fluffy pancakes studded\nwith fresh blueberries, then you're in luck! July is National Blueberry Month, and there's\nno better time than right now to make 'em. That means these purplish-blue berries are\nin abundance right now and at some of the lowest prices of the year. So let me share with you an amped up version\nof blueberry pancakes that I know you're gonna love. We start by mixing together some self-rising\nflour with a bit of sugar and salt. We make a well in the center of this and set\nit aside. Next we beat together a package of cream cheese\n- that's our secret ingredient - along with a couple of eggs. Once it's smooth we mix in some milk, melted\nbutter, and a splash of vanilla. This gets poured into the well of our dry\ningredients, and we mix it. All that's left to do is fold in our blueberries\nand it's ready to spoon onto a hot griddle. After a few minutes on each side, these babies\nare ready to slather with butter and syrup! What makes these so good, besides the fact\nthat they're bursting with blueberries, is the richness we get from the cream cheese! To get the recipe for our Blueberry Cream\nCheese Pancakes all you have to do is visit our website. I'm Howard, with Kelly in the Mr. Food Test\nKitchen, where today we found a blueberrylicious way for you to say, \"Ooh It's So Good!\" Good? Mmhmm. You left me some? A little bit.", "XMoz1gfMuYM": "okay so we're gonna make a lemon blueberry cheese cake cake yeah it tastes so good but it took like a whole day to make so I'm gonna list all the ingredients down below when the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna make the Cheesecake so what you want to do is pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees you're gonna need that 8-inch springform pan you're gonna like butter it all together line the bottom with parchment paper already had like pre-cut parchment paper and then you're gonna wrap the pan with aluminum foil because we're gonna do a water bath and you don't want any other water to get inside the cheesecake [Music] okay so once you do that you want to pulse blueberry cream cheese in a food processor once all this and food processor they're gonna make put it into a mixing bowl and you're gonna add in you're gonna add in sugar flour and then you're gonna beat it until creamy and then you're gonna add in the vanilla so the blueberry cream cheese mixture should look like that once you finish with the food processor and then just add it to a bowl and right here you're gonna add the sugar in the vanilla again I'm going to put all the ingredients like how much I use below because it was a lot of shade and then you're just gonna meet and beat it what the handheld mixer okay so once you beat it you're gonna add in your eggs now you're gonna have to bake them in one at a time mix it a little bit at the other a mix it a little bit and then finally you're gonna mix in the sour cream heavy cream and then pour the batter into the springform pan bake it for like 40 to 45 minutes and then you're gonna put it in the refrigerator for overnight you can keep it in every weather hold a night or like five to six hours I chose to keep mine overnight I think it I think it helped better a little bit like that [Music] okay so make sure you have hot water boiling because once you pour the batter into the spring foam pan y'all you're gonna see what I'm doing you're going to add the water yeah please excuse my baby she's snappy you're gonna add the water on the side but be careful because you don't want to get any of the water inside with the cheesecake that's why you have good before you but I feel like I'm repeating the show and while I bet so just gonna look like once you cooked it place it in the fridge order overnight and I start on the cake okay so you're gonna do the same thing you did with the cheesecake layer except this time you're gonna put flour at the bottom of the pane you know like coating to make the cake you want to sift the you're gonna sip the two cups of flour cornstarch and baking powder and the salt and you're gonna set it aside remember I'm gonna put all the ingredients at the bottom then you want to start together milk and lemon juice and set that aside to and kind of let it Cardle up you can see here kind of how it's gonna look [Music] okay so you're gonna get you a KitchenAid mixer they're gonna beat the sugar and butter on medium high until pale and fluffy it's gonna have like this nice fluffy color and then while the mixer is going dogs you're gonna add the eggs one at a time after each like mix so you just add it mix it add it mix it and it should look like something like this [Music] [Music] remember y'all just add the eggs one at a time let it mix all the way through and then you're gonna add in vanilla extract then you're gonna also add in the lemon beurre this time to just kind of you know and once you've added the vanilla scents I mean that's at the community the lemon zest in the vanilla you're gonna add in the flour so what you're gonna do is you're gonna scoop flour then you're gonna add in the the milk mixture so the milk and egg mixture you're in an ad that slow in here so you're not like 1/3 cup of flour then 1/2 a cup of the milk mixture with our complier milk mixture and so on and so on everything [Music] you [Music] okay so that's how the batter is gonna look like once it's all completed of mixing you're gonna get a small bowl and you're gonna get retox blue beige it's flowers so for blueberries kind of toss it a little bit and then you're gonna mix it with the spatula mix it together with the blueberries pitted in the oven once you mix it you put it in strong pants put it in the oven let it cook for 30 to 35 minutes let him cool for like 15 minutes and then pop it out and then you're gonna start on the left I see and the icing was so easy to make I don't realize how easy I loosen it does my stomach okay so mix all this spread it into the pan and like I said before later bait yeah I was hella tired doing this like this hey we wiped you out so so so tired but this is me just making sure it's all even remove whatever things I try to be perfect over there over there there's no such thing as perfection y'all are just a branch okay so it kind of look like that put it in the oven and let's get started on the frosting so again you're gonna use your KitchenAid mixer and I mix butter and cream cheese and you're gonna beat into there no lumps remaining you don't want to over beat it or your frosting can end up like runny or whatever I had to make this twice because the first time I over beat it and just don't overbeat it and then you're gonna add vanilla salt and lemon zest and then beat it again and then you're gonna gradually add the powdered sugar and it's gonna come together so nice job and once you add the powdered sugar y'all just like slowly beat it like you get the flour whatever I'm about to explain in this right but there's ways that the videos you can see and then you just want to icing the cake and it's gonna turn out so good job like this has to be one of my favorite cakes and put this in my fridge rater for like 45 minutes once you complete it ice in it or whatever top it with some blueberries and some lemon oh my god it's gonna taste amazing and that's the finished product and I hope you guys enjoy until next time y'all this cake was bomb [Music] you", "PCm5gP-wAqI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

baked cheesecakes and they are really really simple and you can even cheat a little bit and use jam instead of the blueberry sauce that I'm going to make in this video they're beautiful they're really delicious and they're super super simple so to make the blueberry sauce all you need to do is add your blueberries I'm using frozen but you can use fresh add your blueberries and your sugar and just mix there and in a pan over a high heat until it bubbles and that won't take you that long really but make sure that you keep stirring it because you don't want the sugar to burn once it started to bubble quite a lot you're now ready to add your lemon zest and your lemon juice it just adds a little bit of tartness which I really like but as I said you could just buy this sauce you don't need to make it if you don't want to if you are making this sauce I would recommend making it around about thirty minutes to an hour before you make the recipe that just gives it time to cool you want to leave this over a high heat for around about five to 10 minutes until you've noticed the sauce has thickened to make the base is a really simple all you want to do is add your butter to your biscuit crumbs and mix it until it's the consistency of wet sand if you're not sure or you're trying this recipe for the first time don't add all of the butter at once just add a little bit at a time until you get the right consistency I've got a twelve hole muffin pan here that I've lined all you want to do is push in the biscuit crumbs until they're really firm in the bottom then you're going to leave those on the side while you start on the filling the filling is really really easy and you can make this by hand in a mixer or in a food processor and if you want to you can just put the whole lot in all in one go but the way I like to do it needs to add the cream cheese first and mix that until it's really really smooth because sometimes that can take a while and you don't want to add too much air to this recipe so just mix it until it's really smooth and then add the rest of you ingredients in any order that you liked I'm using a piping bag with the end cut off but you can't just use a spoon try not to get any air bubbles in this if you can but if you do feel like you have got some air bubbles in then just give the whole tray a firm tap and that should get rid of any large air bubbles this recipe should make exactly 12 individual cheesecakes I've allowed the sauce to cool and you just spoon it on to the top and then using maybe a toothpick or a fork or a chopstick like I'm doing you just want to swirl it on the top you can be as generous or not if you prefer with the sauce on the top the important thing is that when you are swirling it try not to go all the way to the bottom you don't want to disturb your biscuit base you only want to be disturbing your cheesecake filling pop the tray into a preheated oven at a hundred and forty degrees fan for 22 to 25 minutes they will rise a little bit while they're in the oven you still want this to be a little bit of jiggle though that way you'll have a nice Center and they do continued cooking after you've taken them out of the oven make sure that you leave them for at least 30 minutes before you put them in the fridge and once they're in the fridge I'd recommend leaving them at least three hours before you tuck in thank you so much for watching I really hope that you enjoyed this video and I'll catch you in the next one", "O1pdKf0grRQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music]

with these red white and blue boozy popsicles and sure these are actually red white and purple but hey this is America it's what color we say it is got it good but anyway since colors aren't actually flavors we're also going to call this a strawberry blueberry cheesecake popsicle so let's go ahead and get started and the first step is to make a simple syrup and despite the name this is actually very easy to do so in a little saucepan we're going to dump some white sugar and some water not equal parts that's a classic simple syrup but this one has a little more sugar in it and of course I'm going to give you all the exact measurements on food wishes so what we'll do is we'll stir that together over medium heat until that sugar dissolves into the water and the mixture basically turns clear and it's only going to take a couple minutes so don't go anywhere just stand there stir it once in a while until it basically looks like that at that point we're simply going to turn off the heat and let that cool down to room temperature while we get started on the next step which is the first layer also known as the strawberry layer so we're going to take some fresh strawberries and trim them up we're going to cut off the top of course and I'm just going to quarter those into a measuring cup right there I saw a little piece of green leaf which I pulled out but we can't have that so we're going to trim up those strawberries and then I'm going to transfer them into this little mini food processor that I believe I got when I opened a free checking account but feel free to use a normal-sized food processor or even a blender and then besides the main ingredient each one of these layers is getting the same two additional ingredients which are the simple syrup we just made and to make a mousse II some vodka so we're going to pour in about 3/4 of a shot of vodka along with our now cooled simple syrup and then we'll go ahead and pop the top on and blend this until smooth or at least as smooth as one of these little things is going to get me so we'll go ahead and blend that smooth and don't worry about the pink color that's all the air bubbles those are going to dissipate in this will take out a much deeper color and once our fresh strawberry puree is done we're ready to start building these popsicles and I'm going to use one of these your standard plastic popsicle mold and of course you could just use little paper cups and popsicle sticks totally will work so I'm gonna go ahead and distribute my strawberry mixture evenly between those six molds and then we're going to do is we're going to toss that in the freezer so that layer can freeze before we add the second layer which is the cheesecake so in a bowl I have some nice soft room-temperature cream cheese and I don't want to give the brand but I'm using the one from that city whose sports teams aren't that good and then to that we're going to add some simple syrup and we'll mix that up before we add our vodka this time and you really should have this gradually so it's easier to mix but I'm not into that I dumped it all in and it does look like hell at the beginning but just keep mixing and mix and mix in and pretty soon it will look heavenly and by heavenly I mean perfectly perfectly smooth just like that and then we can go ahead and add our vodka to this layer and when that's incorporated you should have a nice pourable cream cheese mixture and by the way we're calling these boozy popsicles because there is a little bit of alcohol in them but not that much I probably describe it as not enough to make you giggle but enough to make you grin which is still pretty good and then once our strawberry layer has firmed up which is probably going to take you at least an hour we'll go ahead and top with our white layer of course dividing it equally between the six molds and one reason you really want to make sure that strawberry layer is frozen solid is because if you add this room temperature cream cheese mixture on top it will kind of melt it make like a pink layer which as you can see happened a little bit here cuz I was in a hurry but no big deal as long as that strawberry layer is kind of firm you should have some decent looking layers and then once our cheesecake layer is done we're going to do the exact same drill again we're going to freeze that layer until it's firm and top it with the final layer which of course is our blue layer Starring blueberries and just like our strawberry layer we're going to puree this with some simple syrup and some vodka and we'll blend that as smooth as our device allows and just like the strawberries this is going to appear a lot lighter right now with all these air bubbles blended into it then it will at the end okay this is actually getting darken up and thicken up beautifully and then like I said when the Cheesecake layer is firm we're going to pull that out we're going to top it off with our blueberry mixture and once we've done that we're finally ready to put in the sticks and of course because I'm using these fancy molds it comes with this little drip guard and by the way people please do not be sampling the vodka while you're doing this check out this last one I'm placing totally upside-down had no idea completely oblivious so like I said don't do too much vodka sampling while you're working on these kids that's called a cautionary tale but anyway I did realize my mistake about five minutes later so I flipped it over and as they say all's well that ends well and then all we need to do is let these freeze completely solid I totally recommend overnight but that's between you and your patients to decide and at that point of course they're ready to enjoy and look at those beautiful three layers which of course represent life liberty and the pursuit of lusciousness and all we have left to do is take off that protective plastic sheath and start eating and man were these delicious basically you're tasting pure fruit as far as texture goes I thought this came out perfectly it's really not that hard and I see it's really much more like a strawberry sorbet and as you're eating this you have complete freedom of choice you can eat straight down eating all three flavors separately or you can go down the side and bite where the layers intersect and get some strawberry cheesecake and then some blueberry cheesecake so I find that kind of freedom very empowering of course that could also be the vodka but anyway that's it a fun delicious patriotic popsicle based tribute to America I think if the founding fathers were alive today they'd be so proud of this and would agree that all those struggles they went through we're totally worth it okay so I really do hope you give this a try head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredients and more info as usual and as always enjoy", "ZtRuU-aKPy0": "Who doesn't love cheesecake, the creamy sweet tasty dessert that melt in the mouth :p This

here is a remake of one of the most popular from my non vegan days the white chocolate blueberry cheesecake check it out you will need vegan cream cheese tofu vegan sour cream any milk alternative of your choice melted vegan butter white chocolate sugar a combination of flour and cornstarch some apple cider vinegar a bit of salt and vanilla extract for the crust this time I am using graham crackers with a bit of sugar and some melted vegan butter get it all processed together in the food processor and then just press it into the bottom and up the sides of a greased and parchment lined cake pan I do use cake pans not springform so click the link below to find out why I do not prefer springform pans maybe you will agree with me I have converted a lot of people and they have said they will never go back to using a springform pan okay well anyway get that crust into the freezer while you prepare the cheesecake batter this is a super easy way to make cheesecake because it is essentially just everything together in the food processor I do like to get the cream cheese in the tofu smooth it out first then I add the rest of the ingredients in no specific order really [Music] pour the batter into the crust and then bake it in a water bath in a preheated 335 degree fahrenheit oven for an hour after the hour I do turn off the oven but I keep the Cheesecake inside for another hour to cool down then refrigerate it overnight to set to unmold the Cheesecake from a regular cake pan just submerge it into hot water and that will release the fat and it will turn out quite easily transfer it to a serving platter and then add the blueberry topping you can use a homemade compote or a canned pie filling whichever you prefer and I'll provide the recipe for the blueberry compote on the written blog post so just click the link below as you can see this cheesecake is super creamy and I bet you no one will ever believe this is vegan I do hope you will try it so head on over to

be sharing how to make blueberry cheesecake cupcake for the ingredients we need 2 eggs 2 tbsp of sugar this will be for the meringue 1 and 1/2 tbsp of sour cream 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla half a cup of milk 3/4 cup of sugar 1 and 1/2 cups of cake flour and 1/2 a cup of butter to begin we're going to beat the half a cup of butter the butter should be at room temperature so I'm just using a whisk in here and then I added the sugar so we're going to mix this until it is well combined then we're going to add the vanilla at this point I'm just going to switch to UM a handheld mixer now we will add the sour cream continue mixing [Music] this point we just kind of separate the eggs the egg white we'll go to the metal bowl and egg yolks we'll go to the butter mixture we can I set the egg whites for a second and then we're going to continue beating the butter mixture until it is well combined now we will slowly add the milk as you add the meal the butter will split but that's okay as soon as we add the flour mixture it will come back into one smooth consistency so at this point we're gonna set this aside and we're gonna combine the dry ingredients so combine the flour salt and baking powder give it a quick mix and then we will save this into the butter mixture [Music] and then using a spatula we just kind of fold in the mixture until it is well combined again do not offer a mix custom or you mix I'm you're gonna develop the gluten so now we're going to set this aside and we're going to beat the egg white until it is frothy once it is 40 we can gradually add the two tablespoon of sugar once the sugar is all in continue beating until we reach the stupid stage the meringue will make the batter or the cupcake batter in lighter so that's the purpose of doing this so this is now does this big stage we're going to add the meringue into the butter into addition using the folding method again once the meringue is all mix we can add the second batch of the meringue just like so by the way your oven should be preheated at 180 degrees Celsius so before you start making the cupcakes turn on and pre-heat your oven so this is now ready so I've got a cupcake pan in here nine with cupcake liner so I'm putting the butter about 3/4 of the way full and then we will bake this again in a preheated oven at 180 degree Celsius for about 20 to 25 minutes or until when you insert the skewer in the middle and the skewer comes out clean and this is what it looks like after baking now transfer this into a wire rack and let it cool down completely while this is cooling down we got to move on to making the cream-cheese icing so I've got three cups of icing sugar in here that I sifted 250 grams of cream cheese 1 teaspoon of vanilla and half a cup of butter so to begin combine the room-temperature butter and room-temperature cream cheese the temperature should be the same so it's easy to blend so I'm using an electric mixer to mix the two ingredients together at this point we can add in the vanilla then continue beating occasionally stop the scrape down the side of the bowl point I will add the icing sugar I usually add my icing sugar in three additions so once the sugar is absorbed by the cream cheese mixture I'll add the second one so this is the last addition of the icing sugar so continue mixing until the icing is smooth and light and this is the consistency that I am after I will set this aside now I've got plain biscuits in here that I will process until it becomes crumbs just like this my cupcake has completely cooled down and I have an apple corer here that I am using to create the hole in the center if you don't have our apple corer you can use a knife I've got a store-bought by filling in here that I'm gonna use to fill the center of the cupcakes [Music] now we're just going to cover the top with the three means from the center now I put my cream cheese icing in a piping bag and I'm using a plain tip if you don't have a plain icing tip you can just use the piping bag and I think this doesn't need to be perfect because we can cover the side with the biscuit crumbs just like this now I'm adding leftover blueberry pie filling on top center of the cupcake make sure that there's a blueberry in there and this is totally optional and just putting silver cashews and this is the finished product I hope you give them a try because this cupcake is so good I can guarantee that you're gonna love this and just to show you what it looks like inside when you take out the paper and when you cut the cake or the cupcake this is so moist and light and delicious thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again next week bye", "Zsqju4HtcoU": "hi guys if you've all been staying safe today I'm gonna show you how to make a no-bake raspberry and strawberry cheesecake if you follow me on Instagram you know that I haven't had the kitchen in a few weeks so I haven't had a stove or an oven and this is a super easy recipe that you can make at home without either of those to start we need from crash shortbread cookies and some melted butter we're going to mix these together until the crumbs start sticking together and using a six inch cake ring which I've lined the bottom with cling wrap and the sides is some acetate and into that I'm gonna pour in the cookie crumbs you want to press the crumbs into the tin so you can create a tight base you can also use something with a smooth bottom to help you with that I'm using a ramekin once you press the crumbs into the base just put that into the fridge to set while we work on the cream cheese filling to start with we want to bloom one tablespoon of gelatin in three tablespoons of cold water in the medium-sized bowl we're gonna add the cream cheese sugar lemon zest and juice of half a lemon and give that a whisk if you don't have a stand mixer that's okay you can do this by hand or with electric mixer then we're gonna add our cream and a yogurt we're not actually whisking any air into it just making sure that it's completely combined it's okay if there are a few I'm scared though [Music] now we take our bloom gelatin and zap that and microwave for about 10 seconds into the microwave gelatin we're going to add a few spoons of the cream cheese mixture it's really important to do this because if you add the gelatin straight into your cream cheese all harden up and you'll just get lumps or gelatin throughout your cheesecake butter if that does happen it's okay you can just put it through a sieve and then remelt the gelatin chunks and pull that in again once it's completely combined and smooth you're done with your cheesecake filling remove your crust from the fridge and add the cream cheese mixture to it after you smooth off the top slightly add in your frozen raspberries just swirl the raspberries through your mixture so that when you cut the cake you can see the raspberries and cream cheese now smooth the cheesecake with show with a spoon and put it in the freezer while we work on the top layer for the top layer we're going to be blending with some strawberries raspberries and sugar together I'm using an immersion blender but you can use any kind of blender once it's smooth add some cream to the mixture and set it aside [Music] we're going to do the same thing with the gelatin as we did before and bloom it in some cold water and suck it in the microwave [Music] like before we're adding a little bit of the mixture into the gelatin and combining it before adding it into the raspberry mixture remove your cheesecake from the freezer and at the raspberry and strawberry mixture on top give it a few taps to make sure that the top is completely smooth we're going to place the cheesecake in the freezer for at least two hours or in the fridge overnight I wanted to decorate my cheesecake with a little bit of whipped cream so I'm gonna whip some cream just before the Cheesecake comes out of the fridge I'm just gonna whip it until stiff peaks and put it in a piping bag with a star tip [Music] I'm going to decorate the top of my cake with the whipped cream and some sliced strawberries I also have some of the cookies that I used earlier and crush them up into smaller pieces once the Cheesecake has thoroughly chilled and then I'm amazed it from the fridge and take up the cake cream I've lined it with acetate so I'm going to peel that off and you should give a really smooth finish using the cream I whipped earlier I'm gonna pipe eight small stars onto the top of the cake and then place some strawberries on top then I'm gonna decorate the edges of the tape with a little bit short break [Music] if you have frozen your cake make sure to throw your cake completely before you serve it and enjoy [Music] [Music] if you liked this video don't forget to give it a like and comment down below what else you'd like me to make thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "-4yU9mX4sMk": "today on Munson made this I am making a know big blueberry cheesecake weekend it'll be good my red yeah I know I know today's recipe is something that a friend gave me he told me to try out I try to loved it thought it would be perfect for you all to make for Valentine's Day it's essentially a raw blueberry cheesecake it has a crust made of almonds and dates and it has an amazing creamy cheesecake base made out of cashews so stick around and I'll show you how to make it active time on this recipe is maybe about 10 minutes I have my crust ingredients right here it's just raw almonds about 1/2 cup of pitted dates and a pinch of salt let's grab the food processor and blend this stuff up I paused it here in the middle just to stir it around I still have some pretty big chunks of nuts and dates so I'm going to keep going you want it to be kind of this texture of sand and it to be able to stick together when you pinch it in your fingers [Applause] so it's been going about a minute and I can tell already from the way that it's coming together that it's ready to go it's sticky I don't want to keep it going too much because it'll get too hot but I do still have a few bigger chunks of almond but I'm gonna be ok with that so now it's time to formulate it or transfer it to my pie pan and begin to create a crust I have lined my pie pan here with a piece of plastic wrap and I know we're all trying to use less plastic in our lives but I really don't know a better solution for this because you want to be able to stick the crust into it and be able to get it out later and if you were to do this without any plastic you would not be able to get it out of the pan so that's why I have it lined with a piece of plastic wrap and then I'm just going to dump the crust ingredients into the pie pan now if you've ever had a Larabar that's pretty much what this crust resembles so I'm just gonna work here with my hands and push this into the bottom and up on the sides you can see it's sticking to my fingers a little bit if that's happening to you just moisten your fingers with a little bit of water and continue to push it into the bottom and up to the sides one thing with processed foods that are made by machine they don't have the handmade love put into them so the fact that you're using your fingers to create this it shows that you're putting extra love into this food now as you can see it's sticking here a little too much love and I'm going to moisten my hands again so as I'm working this trying to get it into this crust I'm making sure that the bottom is smooth and pretty much even throughout and making sure that it goes up the sides that I don't have any really thin areas it helps with the glass plate because I can kind of see the light shining through if you do see some areas that maybe are a little bit thicker you can just pinch it off and put it into areas where it's a little bit thinner but the idea is to get the bottom is flat as possible and it's thin as possible without it tearing or ripping apart and then getting it up the sides and just kind of as even as possible at first when you start working this in here you might think that you don't have enough crust that there's not enough to fill your pipe in pie pan but keep working it and you will once it's all around the edges up the sides flat on the bottom it's time to put it in the freezer while you prepare these filling ingredients I've just laid out all the ingredients that I need for the creamy base of my pie I have a gob a syrup I have cashews coconut oil salt vanilla and some lemons that I will be juicing so I'm gonna put these into the food processor the full recipe for this will be down below so if you don't catch the exact measurements just follow the link below to the floor recipe so let's get these in the food processor I haven't even bothered to clean my food processor after making the crust because it's not necessary to the food processor I'm adding one and a half cups of cashews that have been soaking for probably about four hours I have 1/3 cup of coconut oil that is mostly melted it'll become the rest of the way melted as I process this Tuffy's just licking up who-knows-what off the ground the original recipe that I got called for honey but of course honey is not vegan so I am using a ghave syrup instead and I'm adding a half cup of that notice it's a third of a cup of oil 1/2 cup of agave yes that is a lot of sugar and oil but this is an entire pie and it's a dessert and even though this is mostly healthy it does have some sugar and fat in it especially from the cashews I'm adding just a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness I'm adding just probably about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and then the last thing I need to add is the juice of 2 lemons so the lemons add a nice acidity that really brings out a lot of the flavor and the coconut oil really is a necessary component because it is what creates the structural integrity of the base of this pie so don't use any other oil because it's that coconut oil once it cools off that'll really keep everything together so let's blend this up and then we'll pour it into the pie this has been blending for probably about a minute minute and a half and it's a very creamy consistency as you can see so now it's time to take the crust out of the freezer and I'm going to be pouring half of this into that pie putting in the freezer just helps it set up a tiny bit before you do this step so again I'm pouring half of this in here you can just eyeball it smells amazing the lemon juice really comes through as well as the vanilla so I'm going to put this in the freezer with just this bottom layer in there and then it's time to add the blueberries I bet you've been wondering this is supposed to be a blueberry cheesecake where's the blueberries we're adding those now just going to scrape the sides down and then I'm adding a cup of fresh blueberries I don't recommend using frozen just because of the moisture content you want this to still have some some integrity so the blueberries fresh won't mess it up too much and add too much water I did not fully blend these up I did want them to have like a little bit of its texture is the right word but when you look at it still have some flexibly berry just for aesthetics so now I'm gonna take that back out of the freezer it's only been in there maybe like another minute but take it back out of the freezer and pour this on top and that's it we've made a pie it just needs to hang out in the freezer for two hours before you cut it if you don't want to eat it after those two hours you can remove it from the freezer and put it in the fridge and hold it there or just start devouring it out for those first two hours so let's get it in the freezer it has been two hours we've walked a little bit of lights I have made sushi it's time to take this beauty out of the freezer look at that I actually did sneak in there and take a little bit of the saran wrap off the edges but she's set up she's a beautiful blue color purple color let's cut into it first Weiss is always the most difficult to get out but see I did this one okay the line between the two isn't as visible on this it got smeared a little bit but if you look at the actual pie you can see the beautiful layers between the bottom and the top now be careful as you're pulling this out because the plastic wrap you want to make sure to get your knife or whatever you're using to pull the pie out between the plastic and between the the pie plate sometimes as a tendency to get a little bit mixed up or whatever I've dropped a few slices let's just say that before trying to get it out and messing with the plastic wrap so just be cautious of that again this was in the freezer for two hours if you don't want to eat it after those two hours take it out and put it in the fridge you can put it back in the freezer for a little bit to firm up if it feels a bit soft but it should be ready to go directly out of the fridge once you've done that initial two-hour freeze in the freezer so let's give it a taste you can think about this dessert in a couple of different ways you can think of it as a no bake cheesecake or you would think of it as something healthier a raw blueberry cheesecake either way it's delicious it's amazing and it takes very little effort again you can please somebody special in your life by making this for them and it be a perfect dessert for the end of whatever meal you make for them so let's give it a taste the lemon really comes through it's so bright and fresh and it's got that nice well crust is not really the right word for it but that's what it is it's kind of got a nice softness but it adds a depth of flavor to the brightness of the rest of the dish like I said you could make this with any berry that you wanted this one is blueberries which you're perfect it's kind of cool the way that the berries change the texture of the top layer while the bottom layer which is just the cashews and the coconut oil kind of stays a little bit more dense but yeah it's delicious it's great and it'll be perfect for the end of any meal that you create so give this a try if you like it give it a thumbs up share it around and give it a try for yourself if you do take a picture put it on instagram tag me hashtag once and made this i'll be back next week with another video and you have a great week I'm gonna finish this up", "_5nYmI-uFE4": "what's going on today guys we have a special holiday recipe coming at you it's a 4th of July celebrate in America great country right to celebrate we're gonna be making something unique I don't think you've seen this before it's sugar cookie cups you can fill them with whatever you want but we're gonna fill them with like kind of a cheesecake berry mixture let's get started really basic cookie recipe you're gonna need just a tad bit of coconut flour most of the base is going to be almond flour and then a tad bit of a riff route all also and we're gonna do it in a food processor this is my favorite way to do it just because then you don't have to mix as much by hand you just press a button it's easy so what we're gonna need here is 2/3 of a cup of almond flour and I like to get the most finely ground almond flour you can find that's usually going to be what results in the best baked goods 2/3 of a cup and then here we have just 1 tablespoon of coconut flour and then here we have erythritol this is actually swerve which is kind of a variant on erythritol it's slightly sweeter than erythritol but we're gonna do 1 tablespoon and if you like your things extra sweet just add extra sweetener it's that simple 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder I've never measured baking powder in my life 1/4 teaspoon of salt and that is going to be all of the dry ingredients so I'm just going to give it a quick mix to incorporate all the dry ingredients together now we're ready for the wet ingredients and you could if you want to be a pro baker like you're watching a lot of Food Network you can add all the wet ingredients together but I'm just going to add them right in here it's easier so we're gonna need 1 egg here we have 4 tablespoons of butter room temperature and then we're gonna do 20 drops of stevia that's like about 1/4 teaspoon I just usually eyeball this too and then one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract and that is your sugar cookie recipe so now we're just going to blend this until combined press down the sides make sure it's all getting mixed in and this smells really good it's the vanilla smells just like sugar cookies you guys like sugar cookies like what brand where are you getting these sugar cookies from what's your favorite do you like the store-bought ones with like all the icing on them controversial opinion my favorite cookie is subway strawberry cheesecake cookies have them toast them slightly those are the best comment below with your favorite cookie and your favorite American historical figure okay but the first step is so that this is easy to form we're gonna have to refrigerate it or freeze it I'm actually gonna just freeze it so that it takes less long so like maybe 20 to 30 minutes okay so I'm just gonna put this on some saran wrap okay that looks good just fold this up let's pop it in the fridge freezer all right guys it's time to make the filling this is really simple it's kind of like a cheesecake filling two major ingredients it's gonna be cream cheese we got six ounces right here and this is room temperature that's important and then we're also going to add some sour cream that's gonna give it that Twain it's gonna be two parts cream cheese to one part sour cream so we're gonna do six tablespoons of sour cream and then one other tip if you want to make this filling a little thinner like not as dense more light and fluffy you can add heavy cream probably like a quarter cup or so and then you got to have some sweetness in the filling as well so we're gonna do 20 drops of stevia and I know some of you guys are just not stevia fans you think it has a bitter aftertaste I would say that's something you'll get used to over time but you could just use a Ruth root all too so you could use in this I would use powdered erythritol if you use granular it'll be really grainy and you can taste it kind of like sand feel free to add the sweetener that you like to this and then just a little pinch of vanilla a quarter teaspoon just to bring the flavor through from the cookies so that's it we're just gonna mix this together make a nice creamy filling and if everything is room-temperature that should be easy and you really just want to mix it till it's nice and creamy there's no lumps in it that looks pretty good to me so we're gonna pop this in the fridge and pull it back out once the cookies are done baking okay guys I pulled the dough out of the freezer and it's pretty good temperature it'll warm up as you start using it the thing is when it's room temperature it's hard to form into the cookie cups that we're looking for so we have just a normal sized muffin tin here this is silicon molds it's just easier it's nonstick and you can pop stuff out we're gonna do like six or seven of these if you have a mini muffin tin that would be cool too you could do more like twelve this is still pretty warm but it should be able to be formed so ideally you'd want the dough colder than this we're just so impatient and it you don't need it to go all the way up to the muffin tin just you know a little bit enough to hold some filling so like right there you see that that's a pretty good size you got enough to hold a solid like two to three tablespoons worth of filling if it's overflowing slightly okay I'm gonna finish forming these and we'll be back before we put them in the oven okay guys we're back we have six cups here primed and ready to go some of them are more pretty than the others if you're having trouble forming them into cups they just need to be in the fridge or the freezer longer when these bake which we're gonna put them in right now at 375 for 8 to 10 minutes they're gonna puff up a little bit once they come out of the oven while they're still soft we're gonna press out the middle of them again and we'll show you that once they're done baking so let's pop these in the oven here we are this took a little over 10 minutes actually so you got to find some kind of device in your house I think I'm gonna use this vanilla extract bottle is that even small yeah that'll be good right yeah and I'm gonna press down do it while it's still hot right out of the oven look at that just make sure you have enough room for the filling and honestly like you don't need to do this you can just pile the filling on top too and now an important step is we have to put these in the fridge so they're completely cooled before we put the filling in or else the filling will melts and just like kind of go everywhere it won't be good so we're gonna pop these I'm gonna do it in the freezer for like 20 to 30 minutes and then we'll be back for the final taste test we're back these cookie cups are room temperature now they're pretty cool and I think they yeah pop out pretty easily oh yeah check that out perfect so I'm gonna make up a few of these here then we're gonna take our filling and I'm gonna actually use a cookie scooper just cuz I feel like that makes it look nice nice overwhelming cookie scoop oh yeah check that out isn't cooking fun guys boom all that's left to do fourth-of-july red and blue so pop a few raspberries on however you see fit then these are frozen blueberries but they'll work yeah just that looks good so I'm gonna just cut through the middle so you can kind of see what it looks like looks good right let's get a raspberry mmm the sugar cookies the sugar cookies are really the star I must say they're like really dense flavorful that's where most the flavor is coming from soft slightly undercooked which I like even some nuts in the filling that might be kind of good like some walnuts or something and then mix up the berries you can even do some jam like you could make homemade jelly from these mixed berries that would take it up to the next level like some sweetener in there too but overall delicious recipe and we didn't use too much sweeteners which I like only one tablespoon of erythritol and then some stevia so it's not like crazy over-the-top sweetness but it's nice and fresh link to how to make this recipe is in the description below you're gonna want to check out our food blog keto connect dotnet we got all kinds of recipes we have a cheesecake a red white and blue cheesecake recipe from fourth of July I think that was two years ago we got a lot of dessert recipes you can try check out the website let us know what you think thanks for watching", "pdrR_2IORoY": "hi guys today I'm going to show you how to make a baked blueberry cheesecake this is a party cheesecake and the reason I say that is because it's huge and it is going to serve 14 to 16 people so then run through really quickly what you're going to need I'm going to talk to you about all of it but you're not going to all need it all right at the start so you're going to need 300 grams of blueberries split into 100 and 200 about 150 grams of butter a kilogram of cream cheese I know that seems like a lot but I actually have four packs of full fat cream cheese here 250 gram ones you're also going to need some golden caster sugar that's 270 grams you're going to need some flour you could use corn flour if you want to but I don't so you just got some self-raising flour you've got around about 300 to 400 grams of digestive biscuits depending on how thick you like your base I'll go with about 350 400 because I like quite thick base you're going to need four eggs some vanilla extract and some sour cream and I'm also going to be using some blueberry juice as well so that's what you need but the first thing we're going to do is make the base so I'm just going to show you that really quickly I am using something that's equivalent to Hobnobs these are from us they're but they're like an OT biscuit and I actually quite like them for this but you could use digestives or whatever you would normally use for a base for a cheesecake so let's start with that I've got my tray here it's a large one as I mentioned below I have lined it with baking paper which is more like a silicon paper because it's more than grease proof it's actually nonstick and I'm now going to put the crumbs in the bottom of here and just push it down you once you've pressed the base in really firmly you need to pop it in the oven for about 10 minutes so preheated my oven anyway but it's still heating up that's okay all you need to do is put this in once you can start to smell it it's pretty much done take it out and allow it to cool no more than 10 minutes this has come up to the boil and now I've turned it down from six which is my maximum to three so it's about half temperature now and I'm just going to let this thicken a little bit and then I'll be ready I'll take it off the stove and put it in a bowl so it stops cooking I'm just about to take it off the stove now I just wanted you to see how thick it was properly coating the back of my spoon and it's nice and thickness this is the point at which I'm going to take it off put it into a bowl and let it cool now we're going to make the actual cheesecake before we put it in the oven and it is really simple firstly you're going to put your cream cheese into the mixer and you're just going to beat it until it's smooth now I'm adding my sugar we're just going to mix this until it you know it's come together it's pretty smooth just make sure that you scrape down the bowl just give this another quick mix and now all we're going to do is add the rests I'm going to add our eggs flour a little bit of vanilla and some sour cream I've got four eggs here room temperature - small to medium sized eggs if these were large eggs that I've only added three I'm adding self-raising but that's just because it's out you could absolute the add plane no problem all and then sour cream I have a 300 milliliter pop which is ten point six fluid ounces I'm going to mix this together and then I'll add my vanilla now it's time to put it all together so firstly you just need to pour some of the mixture into the bottom all you're looking to do is cover the bottom really okay the bottom is covered and then we're going to add the blueberries you now we're going to add some sauce just be quite liberal don't add all of it and try and make sure that you're getting the blue breeze because you really want to save some of that sauce so you can do the ripple on the top you I've smoothed at the top a little bit and now I'm just going to add some ripples and depends on how you want to do it or I like to do is make lines across this they don't need to be particularly neat or anything okay once you've got your lines all you're going to do is draw a cocktail stick through them and it's just going to give you ripples and you can do as many or as little as you like and that's how you get your ripples you", "Tlt7Kc4WvWA": "hey guys okay and so today I'm going to show you how to make some berry cheesecake fat bombs so they look pretty good and I've been craving some kind of a very fat bomb for a while now and it doesn't seem like there's a ton of carbs in these so yeah I'm pretty excited like always make sure you guys like and subscribe and comment below and share the video and yeah let's get to the recipe and I'll see you guys in a bit okay so what we've already then because this had to sit for an hour room temperature was we got one cup or I guess eight ounces of cream cheese so that's almost a full perk and then we also added a quarter cup so that is four tablespoons of butter so we basically put it in a medium mixing bowl and we let it sit on the counter for about an hour so we just wanted to get everything at room temperature we didn't want to stick it in the microwave because once the butter melts and we're going to have a really tough time getting its all it again so we just let this sit for an hour so now since we've already done that we're going to basically blend everything with mixer until everything is nice and smooth so let me get that done okay so here we have our whipped butter and cream cheese together so now we're going to add a couple more ingredients to this okay so what we're going to do is we're going to grab some sweetener the recipe shows xylitol I'm going to be using some trivia so we're going to add five tablespoons of trivia and then we're going to add one teaspoon of vanilla extract okay so you can mix this now if you want but we will be coming back to this and blending it more once we have our berries ready so we're just going to set this aside for now and we're going to move over to the stove okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to grab a small saucepan we're going to add a quarter cup of water and then we're going to add half a cup of frozen mixed berries so I have these little like smoothie cups of berries it doesn't really say actually how give it half a cup or what not worth these cups are 85 grams I'm gonna try they're just going to stick it in a half a cup and just kind of see you what brother so yeah I mean it's kind of big but I think this is about half a cup so we're gonna add the salt here it looks like we have strawberries raspberries and blackberries blueberries in this so once we have our water and our fruit we're going to turn our burner on to medium heat and basically we just want to simmer them until they're nice and soft so that might take a few minutes here okay so here's our berries we have let them simmer for a couple minutes now and they're definitely nice and soft so what we're going to do now is we're going to set it aside and we're going to let it cool for a little bit we're gonna set a timer for about 10 minutes and see if it's good at that point basically we don't want this to melt the the butter and the cream cheese so that's why we want to let it cool first before we add it into our mixture okay so we've let our very mixture cool and now what we're going to do is we're going to take half a cup of the mixture and put it into our cream cheese mixture so it should actually be about it's like all of it from me and I did spill some water off the side mastering it okay so we have our berry mixture added and now what we're going to do is we're going to blend all of this together again with our hand mixer and we want everything nice and smooth and remember we did have our trivia and our vanilla in here beforehand that we did not mix in yet so that's another thing we'll be incorporating and if you don't have a big enough Bowl I would definitely recommend putting an apron on or covering yourself up because this probably will stain I do that now and I'm going to get this blended okay so here we have our mixture nice and blended so now we're going to get our molds and we will try to distribute the mixture evenly okay so what we're going to do is we're going to get our silicone mold or you can just use a little mini cupcake tin or whatever mold you guys want this I'm just going to use because it seems like a lot but I don't want them too big it's going to make them into eight servings the recipe doesn't actually specify how many they made the mixture out of so we'll see how many of these fell if they make the full twenty then that's great too less calories or effect on then so I'm going to fill these all up and I will be back to show you how many I was able to film okay so here we have our fat bombs so I was just able to fill all of them I did have a little bit left over not very much it was basically like maybe a teaspoon or so which I just ate because it's actually really good it's like very cheesecake so yeah my recipe is going to be making 20 fat bombs and I will make sure I put the nutritional info for 20 or for one serving out of the 20 so now what we're going to do is we're going to stick these in the freezer for a few hours recipes essay for overnight but hopefully it doesn't think gonna need that long so we're going to stick it in the freezer and then I will check up on them every few hours and then I will let you guys know how long it took her mind to set and I will show you what they look like and what they taste like okay so we have our fat bombs out of freezer and they were in there for about just under three hours or so and will vary depending on how cold your freezer is but as you can see they just kind of pop out and I did not spray my pan pretty solid here definitely about to melt in my finger though but they're about because I made them into 20 servings or about 60 calories each under one net carb each so I'm going to try one and we will see what they taste like hey guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe the fat bombs are really good they taste basically like a very cheesecake and there are pretty low in calories zooming you make them into you know quite a few servings but yeah I'll make sure I post the rest of the nutritional information on the screen for you guys and remember the nutrition will be 420 servings just because that's what I did you guys can make them into any amount of servings that you guys want or what your molds allow for oh yeah like always make sure you guys like and subscribe and comment below and share the video and thanks for watching ahh you", "uYWjKidEbDQ": "this is a throwback to the recipes of my childhood a refrigerator cake but I'm dressing it up by calling it a no bake ricotta cheesecake and has all the things you like about the Cheesecake except for the fussy baking part it's very easy to put together but to begin you have to make a crushed graham cracker crust and to do that I have to get very angry mark smash works worse or you could use a little wooden mallet anyway enough of that you take your graham cracker crumbs you mix them with some melted butter I like little pecans in here press them into a lovely 8-inch what do we call this cake pan pie plate dish so that's step a step e there's another odd thing about this recipe your Mix Master KitchenAid whatever you want to call it must be pink or it doesn't work no actually you can use a whisk for this step or a hand beater or a lovely KitchenAid as we have here so you start with a 8 ounce bar of cream cheese lightly softened stick that on there as best you can which obviously is going to be better than I count it just took it off there we go add about a cup of good ricotta honey and you don't need too much because the cheese's are both sweet and you can use sugar but say two squeezes or two tablespoons lemon zest use a lemon zester or use a fine grater so you get zest and not the white pithy part so you can barely tell it's taking off there it's really nice smells so great and then blend that mix it and you don't have to get carried away this is fast no eggs no sugar just that little bit of honey that's it so you can see it's it's creamy it's light it's not over blended you can really do this easily with a whisk or a hand beater somewhere between ricotta and cream cheese which is about what you expect and remember you have a sweet crust and you're putting blueberries or raspberries strawberries whatever on top so the cheese part does not need to be that sweet now you just spread that lovely stuff on top so you have this nice light consistency and then just spread it over the crust so the crust we put in two three tablespoons of butter and the crust so it has some staying power but you want to be a little careful here not to not to overdo this or where this happens and your crust starts to fall apart I'm gonna fix all the errors with the blueberries no one will know and then this will offer them up in the fridge so it's blueberry season it's midsummer obviously but raspberries strawberries are good here too so you have a sort of rugged looking cheesecake here but you want to cover the cake embed the blueberries in the cheese mixture and then pop it in the fridge wait an hour or two okay we've waited the requisite I don't know a couple hours so looks like a mess see what a individual piece looks like okay so it's not the perfect square but the second one will be oh it's pretty good no-bake blueberry cheesecake mmm Marc live", "SlwdPqqoCPQ": "[Music] how do you get your favorite muffin flavors into a

First, to soften the cream cheese & make it super easy to mix by hand, I take the 1/2 block of cream cheese microwave it on HIGH for about 20 to 30 seconds. Because microwaves vary in power, microwave it for a bit and check to see if it's soft enough for your finger to easily make a dent. Add 1/2 cup of Cool Whip, the softened cream cheese and the quarter cup of white granulated sugar. This recipe is inspired by a wonderful recipe I found in a vintage church cookbook and I've posted it in the description below.

really interested in taking classic sort of unhealthy dishes and making a healthier version out of them so I was looking online for inspiration and I came across this vegan food blogger that I'm super super obsessed with the name of that blog is pretty PI's you obviously have to figure out a way to replace the cheese and a really popular option when it comes to dairy-free baking or vegan baking is to use cashews and what you usually do with them is soak them overnight because then the next day when you blend them you get a really super creamy consistency but if you don't have enough time you can also just soak them in boiling water for just a couple of hours and it'll give you the same super creamy consistency but in less time granted it's not gonna taste exactly like cheesecake but it's a really great alternative that still satisfies that craving for cheesecake and then for the crust I used a combination of almonds dates and walnuts the dates really help find the crust together and the nuts give it a good crunchy texture and then of course always a little pinch of salt because it really brings out the flavors and it just makes a super chewy crunchy almost like a granola bar crust using dates gives it that sweetness that you're looking for but in a fruit so you're not having to add a bunch of sugar or maple syrup or other things and it just helps bind it together and kind of keep it sticky another great thing about this recipe is that you could actually kind of use any flavors that you want the cool thing with cashews is that they sort of take on whatever flavor you mix into them so on pretty PI's she used limes and blueberries and when I tried it I just fell in love with it it was citrusy and bright and fresh but you could also do strawberries cherries any really anything you want it doesn't also just have to be fruit I just really love fruit and I think the colors are great but the citrus really adds sort of pop and just brightens up all the flavors I think that a dairy-free cheese cake like this is a really fantastic option for any of your lactose-intolerant friends or people who are just looking for a lower calorie or lighter version of their favorite desserts so really you can make it for anyone and I definitely went around the office and had all of my other tasty producer friends try it and everybody really loved it normally when I find inspiration for these videos I try to change it up a bit and make it unique and make it something my own but with this one I just thought like how can you improve upon something that's already perfect I always like to find ways to eat the things that I really love but not feel bad afterwards and that's kind of where my idea for making a dairy-free cheese cake came from anyone can make it and should make it easy and it's delicious you won't regret it [Music] you", "kqWlV4_oCsQ": "I got my tea hey everybody I'm Lauren Toyota and I'm hot for food shadow lean and I have teamed up to take all the creamy cheesy and sometimes meaty comfort foods you know and love and put a delicious vegan spin on them on today's episode classic cheesecake let's begin it so what do we think of when we think of cheesecake it's sweet tangy and creamy and of course it's made with cheese well guess what I'm gonna make it without cheese and you're not gonna know the difference so we're gonna start by making a really simple crust for the base of the cheesecake and it's actually gluten free because I'm using oats which I'm gonna pulse into flour and just a couple of other simple ingredients so you do need a food processor or you could buy oat flour already ground up okay so we just want to whizz these up in the food processor until it's a really fine crumb and there's no chunks of oats in there [Music] okay so there's our oat flour and now to this we're gonna add some brown sugar a [Music] little bit of sea salt and some melted vegan butter and what does actions up tasting like is the traditional graham cracker crust that you usually see on the base of a cheesecake it's really tasty slightly sweet and it's got like that saltiness coming through so now you just want to pause this again until it comes together and you can pinch it together and it holds [Music] that's that and then you can just kind of feel it it'll be a little bit moist but we're gonna press this into the bottom of a springform pan [Music] [Applause] all right so you just want to dump all of this into the springform pan [Music] and then just kind of shake it spread it out so that it's even and then go in with your hands and you're gonna compact this into the bottom right out to the edges he kind of can feel with your hand whether it's even or not in certain parts so just make sure it's a really Preston I think we're good and now I'm gonna show you how to make the cheesy filling without cheese so for the cheesecake filling I'm using some of my go-to s you've seen me use raw cashews before I've just soaked these in hot water for about 20 minutes to get them nice and soft they blend up really creamy and smooth in a high-powered blender so we're adding those and now the tofu kind of helps thicken solidify Joe up you know bind the Cheesecake so I'm using a soft tofu and you do not taste it once we sweeten this and then I am using a vegan cream cheese product it's a plain one and again because this has like some binders in it it's already set this is our cheese substitute and it helps set it and bake it okay now we're adding granulated sugar and then to enhance that Tang eNOS of a cheesecake we're doing lemon zest and lemon juice so it's not that this is going to taste like lemon cheesecake at all once it's combined with the cashews the sugar the tofu and the vegan cream cheese it's not so much a lemony taste it's just like a tang or an acidity on your tongue so now lets blend this until it's super smooth and thick all right you may need to just push some stuff down the sides you don't want any chunks of cashews and I just see a couple two more seconds okay so look at how velvety this is it's very luscious okay so this is gonna be tasty it doesn't look like much right now but one me bake it it sets up real nice just like a real baked cheesecake so bring in your crust that you've pressed in here and just pour the whole filling in here bare with me scrape out the blender here and now you want your oven preheating at 350 Fahrenheit this is going right in there for 45 minutes and what you're gonna see to know that it's good is the edges will start looking golden brown you'll see that and the center will still be slightly soft like you may even see it jiggle slightly but don't over bake it so just make sure this is nice and even you can give it a little shake tap whatever and we're going in the oven [Music] so while your cheesecake is baking you can make a fresh fruit compote for the top and I've decided to use blueberries which are my favorite so you just want a saucepan over medium heat and you can use fresh or frozen could also do mixed berry raspberry whatever you want and all we're adding to this is some sugar and some lemon juice and you just want to bring this to a simmer cook it for about six to seven minutes until it's nice and juicy and cooked down and a little bit thicker like a syrup and then let it cool entirely before you top it on the Cheesecake stick a long time Saima bubbling [Music] okay so we're good to go here I just want to turn the heat off and you'll you'll be able to tell like the the syrup gets a bit thicker and glossy and then you just want to take it off the heat and to let it cool properly put it into another bowl cuz this is so hot right now [Music] and then don't put this piping-hot thing in the fridge just let it cool at room temperature and then you can always chill it in the fridge overnight if you want along with the Cheesecake so here we are 24 hours later now what you need to do is when you take this out of the oven you have to let it sit at room temperature to cool off because it's so hot you don't want to put that in the fridge then once it's mostly cooled off you want to put it in the fridge to set overnight still in the springform like this you can see we have that golden edge it's nicely baked and now it's solid and set up so only now will you remove the springform barrier to get a lovely golden sided baked cheesecake and I'm not going to attempt to take it off the bottom so we'll just put it on a lovely cake platter like this I like taking it out to the table with all the compote kind of losing on top [Music] nice and juicy you're gonna have a little bit of extra because I think it's nice to serve some on the side if people are gonna want to add more to their own slice I'll just get it right up to the edge get all the blueberries on there nice layer all right this is sexy I think I'm gonna cut myself a slice [Music] very careful okay hold get that little baby and then yeah you're just gonna get all blueberry news everywhere but that's what you want we're gonna put more on here for me and there we have it classic cheesecake that's how you begin it thank you so much for

one container 16 ounces of fat-free cottage cheese the thing i love about this recipe is you're mixing it all up in the blender this could not be easier next you're going to take a half a cup of zero fat greek yogurt make sure that you've taken out any liquid that could be in the container you just want the greek yogurt next you're going to do one cup of blueberries i've used frozen blueberries in this you can use fresh or frozen whichever you'd like i used wild blueberries but you can use any blueberries that you have the next thing you're going to do is zest a lemon you're going to need two teaspoons of lemon zest and an extra half a teaspoon for the sauce make sure not to do the pith the white part that will make it bitter so continue zesting your lemon and keep in mind you'll need a little bit extra for your blueberry sauce now you're going to take two teaspoons of lemon zest and put it into your bowl you're also going to save another half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of lemon zest for another bowl for your sauce for later after you've done that you're going to go ahead and cut your lemon in half i like to squeeze my lemon into another bowl before i measure it out to make sure i don't get any of the seeds into my ingredients that i in my recipe go ahead and measure out two teaspoons of lemon juice also put another teaspoon of lemon juice aside for your sauce for later go ahead and add that into your lemon zest after you have your lemon zest and your lemon you're going to go ahead and add that into your blender too this is going to be so delicious and i love how simple this recipe is by using a blender it's unbelievably good the next thing you're going to do is take one teaspoon of vanilla and add that into your blender a fourth of a teaspoon of salt i like to use himalayan salt but you can use whatever kind of salt that you like now we're going to take two tablespoons of flour and add that in to our blender and after that we're going to get monk fruit monk fruit is a great alternative to sugar and it'll sweeten this up without adding any sugar to it we've used three-fourths of a cup of monk fruit now what you're going to do is blend this all together in your blender the fact that you can make this delicious cheesecake and a blender is beyond the best and the fact that it's so delicious you won't even miss the fat in the regular blueberry cheesecake i've blended it up a little i'm taking a spatula and just making sure that i get everything off the sides and make sure that it's thoroughly blended after you have it thoroughly blended you're going to add two eggs and an extra yolk into this mixture you just want to lightly pulse it that's why you mixed the other ingredients first before adding the eggs because the eggs don't need to be whipped around as much as the rest of it after that you're going to go ahead and spray your silicone muffin tin with some oil i like to spray it and then i like to take a paper towel and take out the excess oil now you're going to evenly want to fill your tray of muffins it's going to make about 16 to 18. also you're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 22 to 24 minutes now let's get into our sauce the first thing you're going to do is get one cup of blueberries again i've used wild frozen blueberries but you can use whatever kind of blueberries you like next you're going to add 2-3 tablespoons of monk fruit depending on how sweet you'd like it to be now you're going to add that one teaspoon of lemon juice that you squeezed from before that you had left over and a half a teaspoon to one teaspoon of lemon zest go ahead and put that into your saucepan and mix them together you're going to go ahead and take one teaspoon of vanilla we also have a great how to make vanilla recipe you might want to check out after you've done that you're going to get one-fourth of a cup of warm water and two tablespoons of cornstarch you're going to mix the warm water and the cornstarch together so that it dissolves the warm water will help the cornstarch dissolve you're going to want to do this before you put it into your saucepan go ahead and add the warm water and the two tablespoons of cornstarch that you've mixed and add that into your pan go ahead and nicely combined the cornstarch the water and the blueberries and your monk fruit and everything else on a low to medium heat on the stove as you can see this is going to thicken up go ahead and continue stirring it until you have a nice thick sauce like this you're going to want to make sure that your sauce is cool before you put it on your cheesecake also you're going to want to refrigerate those cheesecakes overnight look how good this looks this is the ultimate in blueberry cheesecake i know you're going to love it all of the

how to make my blueberry protein cheesecake it's really quick so let's get to it the first thing you're gonna do is take out a large bowl that we're gonna add all of our ingredients into starting with two large eggs and then one teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/4 a cup of sweetener 1 tablespoon or 16 grams of peanut butter 12 ounces or 339 grams of fat free cream cheese if you let your cream cheese sit out for around 20 minutes before you add it in it'll soften up and mix easier to containers which is ten point six ounces or 300 grams of fat free blueberry Greek yogurt and then one and a half scoops which is 75 grams of lean protein Ella ice cream protein powder if you've never tried this protein powder it's as I like to say absolutely delicious the reviews are awesome its price great and it cooks even better now go ahead and mix everything together whether or not you want to use a hand mixer is completely up to you after that's mixed together add in half a cup of blueberries and then lightly mix those in next pre-heat your oven on 325 take out a six by two inch cake pin and then line it with some parchment paper if you don't have a six by two inch cake pan I do post a link in the description below to the exact one that I'm using it's cheap and great quality now take your mix and pour it into your cake pan now into the oven on 325 for 30 to 35 minutes as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's 1120 to 30 grams of fat 87 grams of carbs and 126 grams of protein after 30 to 35 minutes turn your oven down to 200 and cook for an additional 50 minutes to 1 hour after an hour for me it does look done so I'm just gonna take it out once your cheesecake cools wrap it up and put it into the fridge for a couple hours preferably overnight once my cheesecake is ready I like to top it with some fat-free vanilla Greek yogurt and of course blueberries and there is your blueberry protein cheesecake as you guys saw the cheesecake is done so now I'm just gonna try a bite so cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts and this recipe more than satisfies that craving the lean pro weight vanilla ice cream is extremely good so it complements the blueberry very well and its dense so it'll fill you up really fast absolutely delicious a question for you guys what is your favorite cheesecake let me know in the comments below and I'll do my best to put up your favorite

to make my mini protein blueberry cheesecakes so let's get to it the first thing you're gonna do is take on a large mixing bowl and then add in 12 ounces or 339 grams of fat free cream cheese into it a quick tip is to let your cream cheese soften up a bit before you add it in it'll end up mixing a lot easier one teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/3 a cup of sweetener two extra-large eggs one container which is five point three ounces or 150 grams of fat-free blueberry Greek yogurt 3 tablespoons or 54 grams of blueberry jelly I like the all fruit with fibre version since it has 3 grams of fiber in every tablespoon you might not be able to find this specific brand where you live but there's a ton of other companies that make the higher fiber stuff so just look around and last before we mix it 2 scoops or 60 grams of vanilla protein powder take out a mixer or if your cream cheese is soft enough and you want a forearm workout just use a spoon next take out 15 silicone muffin cups and coat them with some nonstick cooking spray if you don't have silicone muffin cups I do post a link in the description below to where you can buy them but you should be able to pick them up locally at most home goods stores for around 10 bucks now you're going to evenly distribute six tablespoons or 56 grams of graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of your muffin cups so that they look something like that pre-heat your oven on 350 and then pour your mix into your muffin cups to finish them off you're gonna top them with a half a cup of blueberries now into the oven on 350 for around 15 to 20 minutes as far as the calories go and the whole recipe there's 1,100 to only 14 grams of fat 116 grams of carbs and 128 grams of protein so if you make 15-minute ease cakes like I do in each cheesecake there's around 73 calories only a gram of fat 7 and a half grams of carbs and 8 and a half grams of protein after around 20 minutes for me they do look done so I'm just gonna take them out after you take them out of the oven if you want to let them cool for around 1/2 hour to an hour I usually put mine in the fridge once they cool the texture will be identical to a cheesecake and they should pop right out of the cups just like that and there you can see the graham cracker crust on the bottom and there are your mini protein blueberry cheesecake as you guys saw the mini cheesecakes are done so now I'm just gonna try a bite the taste and texture is identical to a real cheesecake and for only having 73 calories in each one they're extremely dense and filling these are definitely absolutely delicious one thing I like to suggest every now and then is a kitchen scale if you don't have one it's probably one of the best investments for your kitchen I've had mine forever comes in a ton of different colors those grams and ounces it only costs around $25 shift I do post a link in the description below to where you can buy it alright guys I just want to thank you for watching if you like this

Linda is going to make no big berry cheesecake Thank You sandy for this wonderful introduction first of all you need to watch some fresh strawberries and blueberries drink them off and then slice off the top of the strawberry and slice them into halves repeat this process until all strawberries are cuts then put 1 cup of fresh strawberries into a sauce pot together with lemon zest white sugar and on a medium low heat just stir them off until all strawberries coated with sugar and in another bowl add in 1/2 a teaspoon of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice stir them well this will create a slurry and by this moment the strawberry will release out some juices and come to a boil pour in your cornstarch mixture into strawberries and you'll see that the struggle starts thicken up by this moment you can remove them from the sauce pot until clean bowl and set aside to let it cool off repeat this process on the blueberry add in 1/2 chopped of blueberry together with lemon zest and also white sugar let it coat with the sugar and make half of the quantity of the slurry and then the same things happened juices of the blueberry will start to come out as well and then pour in your construction makes and you'll see it will thicken up as well remove it from the heat and let it cool off in a bowl next for the biscuit base we need to melt 120 grams of unsalted butter and in a ziplock bag put in 250 grams of digestive biscuits sealed it off and use a rolling pin to roll them into fine crumbs into fine yeah into fine crumbs like this and then pour down into your large bowl and in brown sugar ground cinnamon and is a pinch of salt and use a whisk to visit well together and then pour in about 70% of the unsalted butter and stir it well if I felt I need more I will add in the rest of the butter and stir them well until you're able to pet them together in the wet sin and in this 10.5 inch of springform pan this cook at the entire thing is better and pour in your biscuit crumbs use the spatula to distribute them evenly and use a glass which have a flat surface to catch them tightly into the springform pan once that is done fill them into the fridge for about 30 minutes meanwhile we're in 1/2 cup of hot water and it's a 1 tablespoon of gelatin powder stir it until the powder is completely dissolved a large mixing bowl pouring 2 packages of cream cheese soften it up and add in 50 grams of icing sugar one and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 teaspoon of lemon zest and is a 1 tablespoon of lemon juice whisk them well together it was and forgot one important thing which is a pinch of salt because salt tightness flavor of everything and then into a jug add in 1 cup of whipping cream and will stand well until it forms stiff peaks after that at your whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture and then fall down gently using a spatula pouring a gelatin mixture and quickly stir them well together and divide the cream cheese mixture into one two three portion and pour them into a separate role on the first bowl adding your strawberry compote and stir them well together until the ingredients at fine and in another bowl adding a blueberry compote this will form another layer of cream cheese mixture and once the crust is chilled check out the cling film and pour in your first layer which is the blueberry cream cheese mixture use the spatula gently spread them evenly into all the corners as evenly as you possibly could and then add in the second layer which is the strawberry cream cheese mixture and distribute them evenly as well and then the final layer which is the plain cream cheese mixture this is slowly dollop it on top of each other to make sure that the layers are not mixing into each other because we hope to see you clear pretty layers if possible and then for decoration part I just pipe on some blueberry compote juice that I did reserved earlier on just simply use a toothpick to run across the middle part of it Joost this will help you to create a simple heart or wreath pattern store and then decorate it with some fresh strawberries so another way to decorate it by thinning out the strawberries like this and decorate it with some fresh blueberries as well and earlier on I also reserved some gelatin glaze to brush them on the berries this will keep to put fresh and is so shiny wrap them on the plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for about 6 hours to overnight once they are completely chilled use the bar knife and run them on site of the springform pan this will help you to easily release them from springform pan with a kind of cracking and look at that isn't it pretty especially like there's pretty berries are on it now cut a generous slice to yourself today I'm cutting myself a relatively small piece because I'm going to serve this for myself later for myself I like to add on wall fresh strawberry Centers of blueberries look at the gorgeous cake now is the time to trace the texture is light and airy and also the flavor is very refreshing with the lemon juice and also the berries which are so fresh look at that isn't it beautiful it has a very light pastel ombre color on to it and then this time I also hired two special guests papaya outs we know about thankfully my tooth professional taster to know whether you like it or not please make it yourself and let me know how it tastes on the comment box below thank you bye bye", "LED47cLa6i8": "hey everyone today we'll be making a baked blueberry cheesecake first step is to prepare the baking pan for this recipe you will need a 9-inch removable pen or a springform pan lined with aluminum foil notice that we created a sleeve at the bottom of the pan so water won't steep into our mixture when we bake our cheesecake now let's repair the crust for this you will need one and a half cups of crushed graham crackers three tablespoons of sugar and one teaspoon of cinnamon mix well together you can also add some finely chopped nuts to add some flavor and texture once well combined incorporate 1/3 cup of butter stir until the mixture forms of course beach sand [Music] [Music] if you are creating an oreo cheesecake you can also use the same recipe and substitute the graham crackers with oreo cookies [Music] [Music] our mixture is ready and now let's transfer this to our baking pan [Music] distribute the mixture to the baking pan as even as possible [Music] there are many ways to do this you can use your spatula spoon or the bottom of a water glass [Music] [Music] this will take a lot of patience but I'm sure it will be rewarding to see an evenly distributed crust on your cheese make sure to press across mixture firmly into the pan so it won't crumble if you are making a no-bake blueberry cheesecake you don't necessarily have to bake your crust just place your crust in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before you layer with a filling now this is almost ready we will bake this prepared crust and a preheated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes now let's prepare our cheesecake batter you will need 4 cups of softened cream cheese and to this you will add 1 in 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour the addition of all-purpose flour will provide structure to our cheesecake [Music] one of the secrets to a smooth and crackly cheese cake is in the mixing technique and temperature which means that we will have to incorporate our ingredients using the lowest speed of your mixer too much beating will form big bubbles which will then create cracks during the baking process I follow the rule of 30 seconds in making a cheesecake ingredients are added in 30 second interval and at this point you will also need to scrape the sides of your bowl and the same intervals to achieve a smooth cheesecake batter add 1/4 cup of sour cream and continue mixing at low speed [Music] the last ingredient that we will add RDX for this recipe you will need five pieces of large eggs the reason why we're adding eggs in the last stage of mixing is that whipped eggs tend to trap air pockets so adding them in the last stage will minimize those pockets of air in our cheesecake batter [Music] [Music] another technique for a smooth cheesecake is to strain your mixture for those of you who has a food processor or blender you can pour your batter in a food processor or blender and pulse it until your batter is smooth skipping this process will create an uneven cheesecake texture [Music] [Music] [Music] pour the cheesecake mixture into our pre baked crust notice that I place a baking pan on a sheet pan lined with a towel this will prevent the water in the pan from splattering over our cheesecake batter in baking cheesecakes we usually use a lower baking temperature around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit higher temperatures tend to expand the air pockets which will then form the cracks on the surface of our cheesecake we'll be baking the Cheesecake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit using the bain marie method which means that you have to pour hot water into the sheet pan the steam baking process will make sure that our cheesecake is slowly baked the cheesecake will bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes place a baked cheesecake on a cooling rack while hod run a thin bladed knife around the top edge of the cheesecake cool the Cheesecake completely before cooling them in the refrigerator this will allow the proteins in the Cheesecake to set and firm up [Music] top there big chase cape with one and a half cups of blueberry pie fillings you may use an angled spatula to spread this out on top of your chest [Music] so there you have it guys our velvety smooth baked blueberry cheesecake and if you have any question please post it under the

[Music] so [Music] you", "q7dBN45P2N8": "oh and welcome back to my humble kitchen today I am going to be teaching you guys how to make a blueberry and hazelnut makes cheesecake now basically cheesecake is one of my favorite kind of desserts so I think we should probably do a whole series called cheesecake heaven so I've got loads of cheesecake recipes to give you guys but this is one of my like all-time favorites so what we're gonna do is basically start by making the crust now to make cheesecake a baked one anyway and you need a springform tin actually for any cheesecake you need this tin really now all the spring form is that's got a little notch there and fill it and the bottom comes out so obviously this is good for when you're doing cheesecake so you can push the cake up through the middle once it's cooked now grease your tin very well with some butter make sure it's got lots of butter around it so make sure it's got loads of butter on the inside there also another thing to remember before you kind of start is that your cream cheese and your eggs need to be at room temperature so take them out of the fridge about an hour before you plan on cooking now for the crust now in here I've got and we don't don't have a blender if you do it's really handy but you can just do it all in a big bowl with your hands if not so in my vendor I've already got there's a hundred grams of chopped hazelnuts in there and chopped roasted hazelnuts so I've just don't I just bought the whole hazelnuts and just blitz them in here but you can buy them already chocolate so that goes in there now I'm gonna put 200 grams of plain flour yeah this is the eva bit the crust and then I've been just salt just little pinch of salt oh yes I got 100 grams of sugar I'll write down all the ingredients at the end so you don't have to be taking note as we go along so just mix it all together and now I've got two here the last bit is 125 grams of butter now the butter is cold it's just been chopped into little chunks so it goes around easier now I'm just gonna plop that in if you don't have a blender just all you need to do it in a bowl and the big bowl you mix it with your fingers and so that you make kinda like find the breadcrumbs it's a bit like making a crumble if you've ever made a crumble before I'm just gonna blitz it until it just resembles breadcrumbs [Music] [Music] so the mixture is cut it's looking like that as already lumpy it's not quite a fine breadcrumbs but it doesn't need to be it's basically a pastry bottom before the for the Cheesecake so you pop that all into your tin now this makes quite a large cheesecake so I think a bit you know plenty for about maybe eight to ten people with a decent size size so you just Pat it down with your using your fingers or you can use a spoon didn't like it and messy so Pat it down till it's like that it's all firm you don't have to Pat it really hard otherwise you're never gonna get out of the tin later so just so that it's firm and fairly even and basically that goes into the oven now my ovens been preheated on Gus mark three and that's 165 am Celsius so pop that Cynthia them for 15 minutes and you just want it to kind of go slightly golden so that's a bit so it's baked before we put the filling on top okay the crust has been in the oven for about 15-20 minutes and it's gone golden brown brown if you can see so now all we have to do is make the filling and that is pretty easy peasy so for the filling I've got a room-temperature 500 grams of cream cheese again in the blunder so just couple cream cheese in like 500 grams of fat and then we've got 180 grams of caster sugar right say okay so sorry about that my camera cut out a halfway through showing you how to make filling which is not good so let me tell you now what I put in it I can't show you any of it um so we got two cream cheese and the sugar 180 grams of sugar and you just blend that until it's smooth and and not lumpy all the lumps have gone right then you put in 1 teaspoon of vanilla essence and 1 teaspoon of almond essence and then you put in 2 tablespoons of double cream and 2 tablespoons of plain flour now you just actually pop it all in and you put on the year and you whizz it again until it all that smooth now the second to last theme is the eggs now I put 3 large eggs in and again they're at room temperature so I put the eggs in one at a time and I just blitzed it kind of them slowly or if you're mixing it do it slowly don't ever whisk the cheesecake because that incorporates air and that will make it more likely to crack later on so so yes so in here now I've told you all the ingredients I will put them up for you and all the all the main ingredients are in there the last thing that you need is the blueberries and I've got here a planet of 200 200 grams in weight for blueberries I'm just gonna pop the ball in you can see and I'm just gonna I'm not sure you gonna beat it or anything it doesn't need to be cuz it makes just smooth just gonna mix them around so that they're like evenly distributed and then you get your bass and all you have to do is pour the mixture on top so make sure your spring form team is quite a decent one otherwise they tend the mixture could leak out the bottom if it's not kind of strong and tight enough so in goes the filling you can see I'm just gonna Pat it lightly try and get the air bubbles to come to the top I'm going to try and pop them cuz air in a baked cheesecake is not good so um there we are it's just ready I'm gonna put it in the oven now still at the same temperature which is gas not 3 1 6 5 Celsius for 35 to 40 minutes and I'll show you what it should look like once it's ready in a bit okay okay so now it's time to check the cheesecake to see if it's ready now a good way of testing if it's ready it's just literally shaking gently shaking the tin now if it wobbles slightly in the middle if you can see it there I don't shake it too much break it if it's wobbling in the middle that's okay obviously not if it's runny still but just have a slight wobble there and it should be fine that's done you can see it's kind of  it's more baked around the outside but still wobbling now when if you if you are unsure you can literally just turn the oven off and then keep it in there for like until it cools that okay so also another little tip is once the cheesecake has had about maybe 10 minutes or so to cool down after you turn the oven off is to get a knife and to go cut round the edges and basically that means that also helps preventing it to prevent it from cracking as the cheesecake cools down it will contract a bit so it will get smaller and it will pull away from the sides and so if you give it like a bit of a head start here that just helps okay so once you've taken your teeth cake out of the oven and put it in the fridge I think it's always best to leave it overnight so it becomes a lot firmer and it's easier to get out of the tin and what you have to do when you get out of the tin is take a knife and loosen it around the sides a bit at first and also slip the knife under the base of it and so it slides onto your plate easily I'll show you the end results you", "UkDlsaFaVTc": "I turn up so I'm back with your favorite video it's the blueberry macaron video and it could be a really simple recipe as always and of course this could be a really delicious recipe and blueberry is one of my favorite fruits so I'm really excited to show you guys this cool recipe and we refer to the let's get start on this delicious macaron just like with all my macro recipes the base of the macaron shell is definitely the almond meal and confectioner sugar so we are going to mix them together even the almond meal or almond powder is already in its powdered form it could be even finer because there are clumps of almond meal where it's not even in size and I would definitely ruin your macaron appearance we just give that really bumpy arm gel and stuff that really nice and smooth shell so in order to get rid of those clumpy um our meal we are going to blend it in our mixer so my quick tip for you guys is to definitely mix the almond meal with your confectioner sugar because let me just blend in or just grind your almond meal it gets very clumpy because of the almond oil and that's really bad and that's not what we want we do not want our dry ingredients to clump so the compression sugar helps dry out that almond oil and of course feel free to use a food processor or use a coffee grinder which I'm using right now and then the next thing of course is our egg whites we are going to extract our egg whites from our egg and another quick tip for you guys design make sure your eggs are fresh from the fridge and make sure that it's really cold please you guys are baking somewhere like I am right now the egg whites get denature relatively fast because of the water temperature egg whites needs to be told so just with the egg whites and just whip until you have reach a very soft cloudy consistency and for those who have watched my previous macaron videos you guys can get a thumb or skim through this part but for a few who are new to my channel on this video is going to show you the whole entire process uncut and to be in fat for mode so that you get to see every bit of change in making the macaron I know that macarons can be really hard and it could be really difficult especially for beginners so I want to show you guys the whole entire process so you guys could really learn and nail it I know in other youtube macaron videos they like to skip stuffs as you like to cut part adding that it might not be the best for your learning experience because it's best to see the whole entire process and you guys could definitely see that how the egg whites went from a very gooey texture to a very soft and combative section right here and just get a little bit more time and it gets very very very foamy and so it looks like a soft little cotton cloud then that's the point where we add in our granulated sugar as shown right here and a quick tip ringers is that you guys could add in all the granulated sugar all at once I know that there are blogs that like to add it in three parts or added bit by bit but honestly there's no difference you guys should just add it all at once and just whisk it and you guys whisk in by hand that's definitely possible to know where it would just get there but it just takes a long time and you'll be a huge on work out but it's definitely rewarding and you guys have a hand mixer like I do right now you guys could just use it and it will just be faster and simpler and of course another great thing about this video is that I'm going to be guiding guys and you shouldn't get all the shortcuts so that you guys can make this micron in the best and easiest way possible nothing for folks who are baking in the somewhere where your kitchen is really warm mixtures are you with your eggs whites as fast as possible in the highest speed too so that the egg whites do not get warm up to room temperature and that's the last thing we want to do we do not want a egg white that's the nature by room temperature so just lose the edit voice and then try to move on as soon as possible and as you guys can see though to see of the egg whites have gotten much thicker especially after adding the granulated sugar and then it started to appear very shiny and that's definitely what we're looking for we're looking for a raise 6 instance to see and before you know you have achieved stiff peaks I've shown right here so only after you have the chips the peaks are shown oh you guys can start adding food coloring if you guys wish you guys do not wish to add food coloring that's perfectly fine and you guys can move on to the next step I think that food coloring definitely brings a nice touch to your macaron the thing about contouring for macarons is that when you guys add difference to the egg whites it gets lighter as shown so some like dark blue turns out to be a very light blue if you guys are ever given the option of choosing different brands for food coloring I definitely recommend the Wilsons brand because they offer more colors and a call are much darker so it's much richer and the one that I'm using right now is from Walmart they're called supering it's relatively good um just something bad about its just add the color to be better and now we're just with skin stuff so that all the color to blend it evenly and then you guys should still have that hard peak right there how to get that Mike Brown show the blueberry flavor I'm using mini wheats blueberry and it definitely has that blueberry color and flavor to it just to give that show even more blueberry flavor but the main flavor that's gonna give you a macro a blueberry my car is definitely the filling this stuff is absolutely optional so do not worry about it you guys cannot find this stereo brand but I definitely make your macro more blueberry and to all my turno to our gluten-free you guys could definitely skip this stuff and proceed to the next step and just like previously we are going to grind our syria into powder so that we can add it to our dry ingredients pin it in its powder form we are going to add into our confectioner sugar and almond meal and we're going to mix well so now our macaron shells will have a little bit of cereal but that's perfectly fine and sometimes like macarons for breakfast which is really bad but it's so delicious so I think that's okay it's definitely important to mix well so that your macarons all tastes like blueberry instead of having some definite small blueberry to others and then we go to add in all our dry ingredients onto our egg whites also noting is that a lot of youtubers like to add in their dry ingredients a little bit by a little bit but honestly you guys could just add it all at once because it does not affect your macarons so when it comes to really hard step it's probably the stuff that a lot of beginners mess up on its folding the egg whites and the dry ingredients and this one definitely takes a little bit of practice but you guys washed out throughout this whole entire videos you guys could definitely see the folding process and of course this video it's uncut so I got you guys can see all the transitions on how to fold these ingredients so that it becomes the perfect macaron so one quick mantra I like to tell myself is to fold from outside in so that you guys can mix all your drying greens will and we're just keep on boating from the edge towards the inwards so that it becomes very fluffy and it's going to be well mixed and then you guys will keep on folding until you guys have reached this beautiful table constancy as shown right here once it droops fat like lava like right here it's perfect consistency and that's why you should stop and then we are going to pour our batter into a piping bag for me I like to use disposable piping bags if you guys don't have disposable fighting bags you guys are more than welcome to use our reusable piping bags it's just that it's easier to clean and it's definitely much faster and just make sure that you get every bit of the macaron batter onto your piping bag and we are going to pipe straight down from bottom to top honestly it's really simple and as easy as I look you just type it directly from the bottom and then you guys just don't squeeze that a little bit and I'm just going to lift it right there and for those who have never baked before or use a piping bag before that's perfectly fine that's okay and don't worry because it's so natural and easy that you guys would definitely get a hang of it after actual practice and I also left a couple other shots of me piping just so that you guys could see how I do and I'm also providing us a top view so that you guys can see what's going on or you guys were to pipe on the top look at that it's so easy now we are going to bang our cookie traitors to release all the excess air bubbles in our macarons and we're going to bake it in our oven for 20 minutes and it's preheated 300 degrees Fahrenheit other a for a filling part in the meantime while we're baking we're going to make the filling so we are adding our confectioner sugar and a blueberry and we're gonna make a blueberry cream cheese filling as could be delicious it's so delicious and creamy that you guys go and love it the confectioner sugar is going to dry out the blueberry and it's also sesame will give a thicker consistency which is what we want for our filling I'm using a blender you got to crush your blueberry budding using a blender is much easier even though confectioner sugar is definitely make it sweeter so things that's gonna make it even sweeter is definitely the white chocolate I'm using white chocolate candy melts because it's thicker in consistency as easier to manage and here's my cream cheese I'm using six ounce of cream cheese and all our measurements are listed in my description box down below so feel free to check it out one important point is that you have to make sure that your cream cheese is in room temperature and since I got my cream cheese straight out from the fridge I decided to smush it and just like spread it across my mixing bowl just to increase surface area so that it becomes room temperature you and faster and certainly the great thing about making this in the summer is that it gets to room temperature relatively fast so I usually let it sit in my kitchen for approximately 15 minutes and becomes three soft once it become relatively smooth we are adding our blueberries with confection sugar and our white chocolate the greeting about this ruling is that you guys could pipe this filling as a cake or for aiming for you guys with double use this as a macron filling I definitely recommend it's just so delicious and just mix them to it all even and the next four seconds just me mixing the fillings together and mixing sure that it's even at first it seems like it was still kind of too runny um but trust me it would definitely get there and before you know it it's gonna be a very creamy and delicious filling and if you guys are worried that your feeling is too runny you guys could more than welcome to add in more companion sugar just to make the back just a little bit sweeter and definitely thicker in consistency and compacting sugar as you guys already know drives out the bad so that it was definitely even be less running no first we are going to place this macaron filling into our bridge just so that I get hardens up and thickens ups as well one quick thing I like to do is to spread my blueberry cheesecake maximum filling across my bow so that increase the surface area and put in freezer for a couple minutes so that it's doing faster and this is how my macarons to play fresh out of it and of course I let it cool and then I will put off my macarons and look at that beautiful feet and as you guys can see a sticking up a lot and we are going to put all our macaron filling into a piping bag and go pipe onto our macarons I'm so excited and we're almost done so just put all that filling batter into the piping bag and of course this video is uncut because I want you guys to see the thick consistency that I have her here look at it it's so smooth it's so thick and that is definitely the perfect cream cheese texture right there look at that and for those who have a really runny macaron blueberry batter in the middle for the filling you guys are more than welcome to my cream cheese so that it comes thicker as well and now that we got our batter in a pan that way we are ready to pipe onto my claws I have already pair of my macros based on the size and I am going to pipe it directly onto the shell as shown right here it's so easy and turn it if you guys are making these macarons and somewhere make sure that you guys pie relatively fast because this is a cream cheese filling and it gets very warm so that it might spread too much and that's not what we want so just type as fast as possible and then now we are going to sandwich them together and we're gonna place them in the fridge for approximately six hours before serving and I'm not sure you guys notice but the light blue microphone shot has become a lighter color and that's something that happens when you're baking so just keep that in mind adding that like green color now definitely matches well with the filling and it is so delicious and so cute and I've made these macarons for my are a snap and they definitely love it so you guys definite have to make this hi guys thank you so much for watching I hope you guys

here at cake style today I am sharing with you there's amazing tot it is now our favorite dessert of all time it's that good it's my white chocolate blueberry cheesecake tart it doesn't have any gelatin in it at all it's not really a cheesecake it's just got lots and lots of cream cheese in it it's amazing delicious fresh and it's just perfect to share with your friends and family okay so the first thing I want to do is make shortcrust pastry there is only four ingredients in this it's a really really simple sugar powdered sugar flour butter churn all of those up in a food processor or a blender I have this blender and it's not quite as good as the food process up but it seemed to do the job pretty well and then I've got some ice water and I'm just placing a tiny bit in that mine didn't need very much at all to form this beautiful dough which I flattened out and I placed it in a ziplock bag just to chill in the fridge for about 15 minutes I try doing it without this step and it really kind of was quite difficult to get the case into the actual tart pan and I ended up resorting to popping it in the fridge and it was perfect you can see my little pup pup coming for a little visit in the kitchen with me he loves wandering around and just seeing if anything falls off the edge of the counter but I'm just rolling this out with two sheets of parchment paper I take the top layer off from time to time just so that it doesn't sort of crinkle up too much and it allows it to sort of roll a bit smoother and I just want it's easier to make it nice and large now I've got a Tarte case and it has a releasable bottom so the bottom can actually come out of it and that makes it so much easier for laid out when we want to take this out of its pan all I'm doing is pressing it in this is a nonstick tin I haven't worried about any sort of you know butters or any sort of coating at all just pressing it all into the pan and then all I've done is just go around and level it off a bit you don't want to need tiny tiny little thin bits or otherwise they'll get burnt now I ended up I forgot to prick it with a fork in a few spots so I did actually go back and do that before popping this into the oven I've got my little pie weights you can also use foil to cover this and you're going to place this in 190 degrees Celsius oven for 15 minutes then you're gonna take all of those pie weights off and you're gonna bake it again - for five minutes but probably 5 or 10 minutes is good while that's cooling we're going to get started on the filling which is quite possibly the best feeling I've ever ever made I've got some really nice and good quality chocolate it's just white chocolate that's lent really nice and creamy and then I have some thickened cream I'm gonna be whacking this into the microwave 30 second increments at 50% now make sure you stir and stir and stir in between because it's really important to not overheat this so I popped mine in a total of 4 times into the microwave but I just made sure I stirred really vigorously in between because you'll be amazed at how much it will melt after it comes out of the microwave I let mine cool for about 10 minutes or so so that just took the edge off and now I'm gonna be placing in my cream cheese now I am gonna beat this and beat this and beat this because I really wanted to be creamy and puffy and fluffy and it's just such an amazing light texture in your mouth it's so so good now moving on to the berries if you have freeze-dried powder go ahead and use that I didn't have any but I did have these freeze-dried berries so I used a mortar and pestle and just crushed them up I'm fairly certain that the color was a little bit paler for me than if you used the actual powder so the look of your tired in the end may vary a bit depending on what kind of powder you place in what I did was I've divided my batter into two and I just did the coloring into one in the end it kind of is the only thing you notice but when you have a slice of this tart you can see all the variation and because it's mostly a white chocolate and cream cheese I didn't want the whole thing to just look too overpoweringly blueberry so I've kind of gone for a little bit of a swirl you can see that this is fairly thick what will determine how thick it is is how much you whip it as well as how warm it is so if your ganache was a little bit warmer it would probably be just a little bit softer and running up I liked how firm this was I got me to be able to do lots of like smears and swirls and it kind of reminded me of a lot of the sort of health food sweets that I'm seeing at the moment with all the gorgeous speckles of all of our colors and just that imperfect kind of effect and I really loved all of this texture now I carefully take it out of its tin you just I'm going to keep it on the base of the tin there's no reason to sort of remove that and I'm going to go ahead and pop on a little bit of extra chocolate so I used 290 grams of chocolate in the tart and then that extra 10 grams I ended up using for the decoration so I bought 300 grams and I used all of it up by the time I added those little bits on you can decorate in any way that you like I loved having the blueberries I swear you really really do need to have the fresh berries with every slice so save all of the extra ones and when you serve it to your guests or your family be sure to give everybody two or three blueberries because it just really kicks it up a notch and then I pop this into the fridge for about 30 minutes that's all it needed to set it is a beautiful recipe that lasts really really well for a good few days so just keep it stored in the fridge cupboard and this will just sort of mature in its flavor and its color as the days go on it's absolutely delicious thank you so much for watching guys and I will see you again next week", "zhtze1Ye4cQ": "[Music] welcome back to cooking with the town - if you

cheesecake milkshake whatever you like to call it I'm gonna be most likely interchanging the titles and names of that throughout the video anyway right now we're gonna blueberry cheesecake smoothie we started out with some ice and I thought both my kids helping out with this shading in Sienna we start out with some ice and have both of them adding some almond milk shading pour it in the heavy whipping cream Siana with blueberries both of them adding the cream cheese that we cut up to put into the blender to mix smoothly and we have Siana adding the sugar substitute and shading with the vanilla zero carb whey protein and that's basically all the ingredients is needed for this milkshake now you can add as much ice as you want the more ice you have the more thicker that it will be but this one is going to be pretty big anyway due to the heavy whipping cream and the cream cheese that we add to this mixture then we put the lid on it and put onto the blender you can blend this for about five to ten seconds once you see it all well combined if you have enough liquid it should blend fine if you have too much ice in and they may clump up a bit but you can mix it for five to ten seconds a little longer if you want to make it thicker also due to the heavy whipping cream and the cream cheeses in it this was how it came out nice bluish purple color that blueberries normally give off and we scoop this into a jar basically due to the fact that we couldn't board straight in it would spill all over the place because the lip was a little cup we were adding was smaller than what we were using and then we also put some into the cup for our kids a try we added some sugar-free whipped cream on top that went everywhere and then it was time for the taste test my daughter she is a shimmer holic and she went straight for the whipping cream for the toppings she's that person that only eats the icing off of cake and cupcakes only east of filling out of Oreos so when it was time to drink it she just decided to blow bubbles on it she only wanted the top part half of it my son shaded he drank the whole thing and enjoyed it this was how it looked nice bluish purplish color again for the blueberries it was thick and creamy from the heavy whipping cream and the cream cheese and had a nice sugar from the sugar subsidy is but you can adjust the sugar levels or add additional tops to it you can do mixed berries if you like now our kids got a chance to play with the rest of it they added some mini marshmallows to it and decided to just make mess all over the place so whipped a drink I don't know what do you recall what they made but they liked it hope you guys like to try this recipe out sweet let me know in the comments if you enjoyed it or tried it out and as always thank

you", "elykutbgi-c": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a strawberry cheesecake and this is what it looks like as you can see it has a graham cracker crust and we're doing a New York style cheesecake and then topped with a homemade strawberry sauce that's set with a little bit of gelatin so we're going to start by preheating our oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit which is a hundred and sixty-five degrees Celsius and you will need an 8-inch that's 20 centimeter 20 centimeter springform pan I'm using the two pieces and that just kind of locks into place and then I want to butter the pan or you could just spray it with one of those nonstick sprays either one just do the face and sides just lightly with butter so we don't stick okay simple enough and then for our graham cracker crumb crust you will need one cup that's a hundred grams of graham cracker crumbs now you can buy them just in a box but I actually prefer the taste when I use the whole make it from the whole-grain crackers so you will need about seven of these and then we have to crush them now if you have a food processor you could just put them in there and whirl it around or what I normally do is just put it in a plastic bag and then take some kind of thing I just use my rolling pin and then just crush them until they're nice and fine like I've already done here so put that in a bowl and to that I'm going to add just a little sugar you don't have to but I find just a little helps 1 tablespoon about 15 grams of granulated white sugar and then we will need some butter you will need about 5 tablespoons which is 70 grams of butter that is melted now I tend to add like almost all of it you never know with how fresh the graham crackers are whether you need all of the butter or just part of it so stir it you want moisture all the crumbs that's it all I need that looks good and I hold together so then just take your pan and I'm just going to put the crumbs on the base because as you can see with the this I'm not having it up the sides because I want to see all three layers of the crumbs the cheesecake in the the strawberry topping so I'm just going to press the crumbs into onto the bottom of the pan you can just use I just typically use the back of my spoon or just use your fingers either way it's get a nice even layer okay that looks good now there's two ways to set a graham cracker crust one you could just chill it but today since we have need the oven on anyways to bake the cheesecake I'm going to bake the crust so speak it for about six to eight minutes just until it's set okay so her crust is now done as you can see it's a beautiful golden brown it's nice and dry so what we're going to do is just let this sit for about ten minutes to cool off and then we'll come back and make our cheesecake filling now meanwhile reduce your oven temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit 150 degrees Celsius so now we'll start our cheesecake filling if you have an electric stand mixer like I have here then use your paddle attachment or you could just make this by hand with your hand mixer so you will need 2 8 ounce packages or that's a pound or 450 grams a full fat cream cheese and have that at room temperature let's put that in there and then I'm just going to beat this on low medium low speed just until it's nice and creamy and smooth okay and as always when you're making any kind of batter just make sure to fairly often scrape down the sides and the bottom of your bowl so that way everything gets mixed together so next we're going to add 2/3 of a cup which is 135 grams of granulated white sugar and along with just a pinch of salt just an eighth of a teaspoon and then I'm also going to add one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract for flavoring so I'm just going to beat this on medium medium-low speed just until everything's combined we don't want to get a lot of air into it but we just want to make sure everything's all mixed together okay looks good so you're just looking for a nice smooth batter so now we're going to add two large eggs and have those at room temperature and I'm just going to also add just about half a teaspoon just a touch of lemon zest and that's the odor just the odor yellow part of your lemon don't grate the white underneath because that's a little bitter and always wash or lemons first I find the lemon just kind of cuts through the richness of a cheesecake and plus adds a little flavor so I'm going to add the eggs one at a time because it makes it a lot easier to incorporate the eggs if you do it one at a time and just mix it in you can see a cheesecake batter really is quite easy to make it's going to mix it just a little more have some lumps okay and our final ingredient ingredient is sour cream I'm actually using a light sour cream and a half a cup which is about 110 grams this really I find it gives it a nice lighter texture to the Cheesecake plus it adds a little more flavor and just beat that in and we're done so now this other way now what I like to do is put our cheesecake pan on a larger baking sheet just in case sometimes the cheesecake will leak a little as it bakes and you don't want that dripping down to the bottom of your oven ain't going to mess so I have a pan helps let's pour it in and with the back of the spoon or I have an offset spatula just kind of even it out so now we're going to bake our cheesecake for about 50 to 55 minutes and what you're looking for is the Cheesecake to be set and dry but yet the center of the cheesecake will be still a little wet so our cheesecake is now done as you can see it's set but the center is still a little wet and now what you want to do is take a spatula or a knife and run it around the inside of your cheesecake and the reason we do that is because the Cheesecake does shrink as it cools and if we didn't do this then you would get a lot of cracking so once you do that then just let it cool completely on the wire rack and then once it's at room temperature cover it and refrigerate it for a couple hours and then when we come back we'll make the strawberry topping so now we'll make our strawberry topping you will need 8 ounces 225 grams of frozen unsweetened strawberries and thaw them out completely and then we're going to process them in our food processor or a blender if you have that along with about three tablespoons 40 grams of granulated white sugar now you can adjust that sugar if you find taste it and find it you need a little more just add a little more sugar and just process it until it's nice and smooth okay that's it this out of the way and you will have about 1 cup 240 milliliters of the strawberry sauce so now what I'm going to do is just put it in a saucepan because we're going to add a little gelatin to set our strawberry sauce so it makes a nice layer on top of our cheesecake so there we go and of course when you use gelatin it has to be added to first you have to activate it in cold water so what you need is just about a tablespoon of cold water in a little bowl there and then I'm just going to sprinkle 1 teaspoon of unflavored powder gelatin over the top and putting it on top of cold water activates it and becomes and we want to leave it like 2 or 3 minutes just until it becomes spongy and puffy and meanwhile we are going to heat our strawberry sauce just over medium heat we just wanted to get warm we don't want it to boil it's all we need to do okay so now our strawberry sauce is just warm and as you can see our gelatin is nice and spongy so just add that to the strawberry sauce and then we're just going to heat it on low heat and stir it just gently because we want now we want the gelatin to dissolve into the strawberry sauce it just takes like a minute or two and so our gelatin is dissolved so now what I want to do because we want to cool off our sauce still quite warm and our cheesecakes chilling so we don't want to put a hot sauce on our cool cheesecake so what we're going to do is just let this cool off a little and also while it cools it will start to thicken which we also want so you know that might take 15 and maybe thirty minutes and as you can see there's a bit of foam on top of the sauce I actually skim that off so that our sauce is pretty clear otherwise I mean you could stir it back in but then what happens is it kind of makes si sauce not as clear which is which is okay it tastes doesn't change affect the flavor so anyway it's just let it cool and skim off the foam and when we come back we will pour it on top of our cheesecake so our strawberry sauce has now cooled down to room temperature so we're ready to put it on top of our cooled cheesecake so now do this very slowly because we don't well it may run a little over the sides of our cheesecake we don't want it to try to keep it on the top so just slowly pour and just let it just gently help it along see if you let it set up a little get thick it kind of stays on top better add a little more you may not need it all just a pinned and just with a spoon or a spatula just kind of spread it to the edges now you don't absolutely have to put this strawberry sauce on the top but I think it I always serve cheese cake with strawberry sauce so that's why I kind of like the fact that make it an actual layer on top of the cheesecake it looks looks pretty cool okay so now I'm just going to let that set just for a little and then cover it put it back in the fridge now you could just leave it there in the fridge to firm up for like 3-4 hours but I think it's best because cheesecake is always better if you let it chill overnight and that the flavors mingle and develop and I think it's so much better so when we come back tomorrow I will unmold the cheesecake and cut a slice so we're now ready to unmold our cheesecake so just undo the clip and lift it off and then your serving plate now a lot of times I just leave the cheesecake on that bottom plate but because we baked the graham cracker crust if you want you can to remove that so just take a sharp knife and then just see just kind of get it between the lip and the crust and just run your your knife and get it underneath there and then once you get a bit of it started you can take your spatula so you can do this here better with the knife okay there we go and then just this works get a hold of it and then just with your finger and let it slide right onto your serving plate like so a little tricky like if you were if you're serving it at home I wouldn't even bother doing that but if you're taking it somewhere you might want to or given it as a gift so now if you want to decorate the top you could take a strawberry like a nice-looking one with the green still on it and take your sharp knife and just cut not all the way through just thin slices like so and you can kind of just fan it out and then you put that into the center so let's cut a slice have a paper towel so you can wipe your knife and smooth that a little just cut all the way through must admit without that plate does make it easier to cut just cut a small slice there we have it doesn't that look nice with the three distinct layers I mean you can just have a regular it just kind of jazz's up a regular ride cheesecake and since I always like a fruit sauce with my cheesecake it kind of really works out so I'm just try a little bit oh that's really nice you got the graininess of the crust with then smooth and creamy cheesecake filling and then that really burst a flavor from the strawberries really nice so you can cover and refrigerate this you know probably four or five days so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jules gave joy baking calm", "0voHSymbqSQ": "hi everyone this is chica Flamborough the

recipe but if you don't have one you can do all of this by just bashing the out of this stuff with a rolling pin I have 50 mill away for cookies we're going to process these until they are fine crumbs then I'm going to do the same thing with a cup of roasted salted pistachios well do all the food processing at once so I have a little over a cup of blueberries we're going to grind these until they are nice and juicy now stir together your cookie crumbs and pistachios until they're well combined and then mix together with a stick of melted butter you'll want to prepare a 9 inch square pan with parchment paper so that there are overhangs on both sides and then dump the crust mixture into the pan and Pat it flat we're going to take our blueberry puree and strain it to get out any extraneous skins so that this is nice and smooth we need about 3/4 of a cup of blueberry puree we're going to set our no big cheesecake with unflavored gelatin put half of the packet into your blueberry puree and stir it in until it's nice and combined then let it set up for about a minute then microwave it for one minute add a half a cup of sugar and whisk it until it's really well combined then let it sit for five minutes while the blueberry mixture is cooling down take two bricks of softened cream cheese be as noisy as possible you want to beat them until they're totally smooth with the mixer running at low slowly stream in the blueberry mixture when it's all combined pour it into your crust and then pop it into the refrigerator you need to chill it for at least two hours before adding our second layer we're making a multi-layered cheesecake so we've done the blueberry layer and now we need to do the vanilla I'm using water and the rest of my gelatin to make the vanilla layer so mix it together to dissolve let it sit for a bit then heat it up and whisk it together just like we did with the blueberry mixture and add it into your cream cheese beat it together then add a little bit of vanilla extract and some additional water go ahead and pour your vanilla mixture over the chilled blueberry mixture just remember that blueberry mixture has to be solid and then back into the

people are a little bit afraid of making a cheesecake just because I don't know people think it's very complex and it will take a long time and a lot of effort but it's not actually 100% - because there are quite a few cheesecakes that are super easy to make super fast and you don't even need to pay them and that is the kind of cheesecake we are going to bake today a fast one a delicious one that doesn't need to go to the oven also this is not your common cheesecake it has two different kinds of cheese it has white chocolate that personally is one of my favorite things to eat and instead of having like a fruit or berry topping you are actually going to use the fruit that you were supposed to make the topping inside of like the cheese mixture in your cheesecake I'm going to stop talking and let's get started you will need 250 grams full fat cream cheese 250 grams mascarpone cheese 250 milliliters of double cream 100 grams of butter 250 grams of blueberries 200 grams of plain bisquits one lemon and 300 grams of white chocolate grab a plastic bag place the biscuits inside and start crunching them - very very tiny pieces of crumbs in a small pan melt the butter and then add the biscuit crumbs mix everything together until the biscuits have absorbed all the butter evenly then grab the lemon and add some lemon zest to the biscuits get the line baking tin with a removable base place the Bisquick mixture inside and start pressing it down so it makes an even base for the Cheesecake then put this in the fridge to set completely now in a small pan put your white chocolate melting then in a big bowl turn the cheese cream the mascarpone cheese and the cream and weed it until you have a smooth mixture then add the melted white chocolate and beat it again now add the blueberries and involve them in the mixture now get your baking tin again place the mixture over the biscuit base and spread it so you'll get an even top this goes to the fridge to set for about 2 or 3 hours until it's nice and firm when the Cheesecake has sets just run a knife around to make sure it comes out of the tin nicely place it in the serving plate and that's done I hope you enjoyed this

please do me a favor and click the like and also subscribe if you're new here and click that little bell so you'll be notified every time I upload a new video so today's chocol is gonna be a blueberry cheesecake chocolate cheesecake that's one of the only like fruit fruity cheesecakes that I like that I used to like the four key dough so I'm excited to make this a keto version of this and it's going to be delicious and we can have a little bit of blueberries on keto so let's get started [Music] [Music] alright guys we're gonna start with one egg in our bowl and this recipe calls for a little bit more almond flour so we're gonna do four tablespoons of almond flour I think because of the liquids and the fruit they have a lot of moisture in them you need a little bit more of that flour in there one teaspoon of baking powder we're gonna do 25 drops of the New York cheesecake Capello flavoring you could probably do this recipe without this flavoring and it's still going to taste amazing because the blueberries add so much flavor all right and we're gonna do a splash of or about a teaspoon of vanilla 1/2 a teaspoon of coconut oil 1 tablespoon of monk fruit sweetener or whatever your favorite sweetener is 1 tablespoon of heavy cream and then last we're gonna put in some chopped blueberries now my blueberries are frozen so I'm gonna take out about that mini we're gonna chop those up and I'll be right back all right so here is our chopped blueberries they're still frozen and that's ok they can go in alright we're gonna mix this all up these are your really rich and decadent so you probably would be very satisfied with just one chocolate and this recipe should make close to four chapels and you know you can share that with your family or save them and just have them later so this looks pretty nicely mixed let's get to chocolate right first one is in well that's cooking let's make our topping okay so in a bowl we're gonna add about one tablespoon of cream cheese we're gonna add about 15 drops of our New York cheesecake flavoring it's best if your cream cheese if you let it sit out and let it get softened that works really really well and I'm going to add one teaspoon this is a half so I'm going to do two of these of confectionery monk fruit and if you notice in one of my other videos I uploaded how to make your own confectioner's monk fruit powder it's super easy so check that out alright last I'm going to add a little about five or six more of the blueberries and you can chop these up or leave them whole I prefer the flavoring of the cream cheese with just the the juice that kind of comes off of the blueberries I don't like the actual fruit in my cream cheese topping so you can leave it in or you can take them out however you want after you mix it all up alright so I'm going to chop up these blueberries first waffle is ready to come out alright let's add in our blueberries to our topping I like to just take a fork and you can mix it up that way if you need to melt your cream cheese you can put it in the microwave and melt it really easily like five 10 seconds at a time and it'll be perfectly melted so I'm gonna kind of crush these blueberries and mix them in this is going to make my cream cheese filling alright so this makes exactly four blueberry trifles finishing mixing up our topping this case like straight up blueberry cheesecake or you crush up these blueberries the more you're gonna get that blueberry flavor in your filling and that really pretty purple color as well I'm just gonna keep working on this and get it all nice and mixed and then we will plate our truffles I'll be right back we're ready to plate these up so I am going to grab two of our chafa here's our first one how pretty that is and

tart it's safe to say that cheesecake is one of our favorite desserts here at tasty we tested a bunch of different recipes and techniques to find a foolproof ultra creamy vanilla cheesecake so here's how to make a classic crack free cheesecake every good cheesecake starts with a springform pan greasing the pan with nonstick spray or butter is gonna help easy removal and help prevent cracking down the line adding a band of parchment paper will ensure you've got those smooth picture-perfect sides when you go to remove the spring form the foundation of cheesecake is the crust it only requires three ingredients to make a classic graham cracker crust this is the simplest part of the recipe the combination of sugar and butter helps hold everything together for a really fantastic crust some people like using other types of cookies you can easily swap it in right here we're gonna do a bottom crust only some people like the crust on the sides it's totally a matter of preference just use a flat surface to spread the graham cracker mixture into an even layer now you're gonna bake it for eight to ten minutes until it's golden brown and just let it cool as you prepare the filling now it looks like a lot of dairy but remember it's a rich velvety dessert you really need it here where I need full fat cream cheese here this is not the time to skimp with reduced fat I know it looks like a lot of sugar it is we tried to reduce it but you really miss out on some of that classic cheesecake flavor make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature before getting started this way they'll be easier to mix and give you a smooth cheesecake without any lumps we're adding a bit of heavy cream it's a subtle difference but it's gonna help smooth out the batter it's a personal preference and you can omit it but we wouldn't I'm adding in sour cream for a bit of added tang and I'm also going to add some flour which is gonna help bind the cheesecake together and help prevent cracks to flavor the cake I'm using a whole vanilla bean a really easy way to remove the seeds is by splitting it down the middle lengthwise and use the blade of your knife to slowly the seeds out while you can use vanilla extract in a pinch the intense flavor of a bean is really hard to beat eggs are crucial in any baked cheese cake they add in creaminess and also help bind the Cheesecake together as it bakes some recipes will call for adding extra egg yolks we found in testing that this makes a denser cheesecake so for our era version we're sticking with whole eggs only so add in the eggs one at a time if you dump them in all at once you run the risk of having a really lumpy batter okay so this part is crucial as soon as the eggs are incorporated stop mixing over mixing can result in a really dense cheesecake you also want to be scraping your bowl down to ensure everything is thoroughly mixed from here it's really easy just pour the batter onto the cooled crust and smooth out the top if we didn't bake the crust it would mix in with the batter who wants up even cooking and cracking is a huge concern when making cheesecake one of the best ways to prevent that is to use a water bath while baking even though the pan is sealed there could be a slight opening where water could get through and give you a soggy crust to prevent any water from seeping in we're gonna wrap our springform in two sheets of foil to really seal it place the pan in a large heavy baking dish and fill it with hot water about one inch up the sides of the pan the hot water creates a moist environment in an otherwise dry oven so the cheesecake doesn't split from drying out there are several methods where you can start your cheesecake in a hot oven and then lower the temperature well you do get some lift you also run the risk of burning or cracking your cheesecake for our recipe we're gonna do a steady moderate heat all the way through then turn the heat off and leave the Cheesecake in the oven for another hour to finish baking allowing the cake to sit in the oven allows it for it to be fully set in the middle and get a little bit of color you can see that the cake that was taken out after an hour isn't fully cooked and looks like a gloopy mess sometimes cracks happen there are so many reasons that can cause a crack such as high-temperature over mixing a water bath but this doesn't mean that you can't end up with a beautiful delicious cheesecake in the end a great way to cover up a cracked cheesecake is to make a sour cream topping the stop being is really simple it's just sour cream sugar and vanilla extract all mixed together it not only covers up the crack but it's also really delicious and can be used on uncracked cheesecakes as well for a sour cream topping you don't need a water bath just bake it for 10 to 15 minutes just so the top a set and continue the recipe as normal after sitting in the oven for another hour the cheesecake needs to cool at room temperature and another way to prevent cracks is to gently go around the rim of the cheesecake with a knife at this point the center of the cheesecake should still have a slight jiggle just like this once the cheesecake is cooled place it in the fridge covered with plastic wrap to fully set ideally overnight but you can still get a really good result in about 4 hours to remove the Cheesecake from the pan unlatch the side of the springform and carefully lift off the frame gently peel back the parchment and you're gonna see those beautiful smooth sides there's such a wide variety of toppings you can add to your cheesecake but for ours we're gonna keep it simple with a ton of fresh berries to get the perfect slice fill a large vessel with hot water dip your knife into the water then gently Pat it dry before slicing the hot knife will ensure that you get a smooth cut every time [Music] we love serving our cheesecake with a berry coulis which is basically a fancy word for a berry puree that has been cooked down until it's thick it's the perfect complement alongside all those gorgeous fresh berries there's a reason we make so many cheesecakes here at tasty they're relatively easy they're great for a crowd and most importantly they're downright delicious by using these tips and tricks you too can make the dreamiest creamiest cheesecake of your life you", "vv1jm4cfu2Q": "this layered

"xL9dklHXovU": "welcome i'm Deronda with foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to make this very very summertime cheesecake to get the crust started you're going to need one and a half cups of cinnamon graham cracker crumbs now I've taken my graham crackers I put them in a food processor to get this fine texture if you don't have a food processor no worries you can put it in a ziploc bag make sure you get all the air out and use a rolling pin to get it into this texture I need three tablespoons of sugar 1/2 a cup of butter two cups of heavy whipping cream 2 8 ounce packages of cream cheese at room temperature and a half cups of sugar 2 tablespoons of lemon juice 1 cup of fresh raspberries one cup of fresh blueberries and two cups of fresh sliced strawberries now let me show you how we're gonna get this together and we're first gonna start with our crust over here to make the crust we're gonna add those fine cinnamon graham cracker crumbs right in here with our sugar and you probably want to take a fork and just mix that sugar into your cinnamon graham cracker crumbs next we're gonna add this better that I've melted oh my goodness whew that really did give me a nice scent of that cinnamon oh my goodness yummy and now we're just gonna incorporate the graham cracker crumbs in this cinnamon into the butter and at this point you want to be preheating your oven to 375 degrees because this is gonna bake for seven minutes and it needs to be cool before we add our filling on top of our crust so next we're taking a 9-inch springform pan you don't need to butter it or you don't need to grease it and we're gonna add that cinnamon sugar graham cracker crust right in here I've been packing my graham cracker crust into my 9-inch springform pan I worked it up along the sides of the pan here so now this goes in the oven on 375 degrees preheated for the next seven minutes so off it go I'm adding my cream cheese into a medium mixing bowl and I've sliced down the center of my 8 ounce package of cream cheese here and then I'm going to add it into my mixing bowl by just cutting it into equal blocks I think it is better to mix your cream cheese with your sugar which we're gonna add and our fresh lemon juice now fresh lemon juice makes all the difference in the world and I use a sieve just so I can catch any seeds that will be in there and I see a little seed in there as you can see right here on the end definitely don't want that in there all right now we're gonna take a hand mixer and we're gonna mix this until it's nice and smooth now that we've got our cream cheese and our sugar and lemon mixed well together and creamy we're gonna whip in the two cups of whipping cream the heavy whipping cream very slowly and you'll continue doing this until it's light and airy after about three to four minutes of whipping this is what your center to this cheesecake is gonna look like let me take out the beaters and then we'll bring back that cinnamon graham cracker crust and you want to make sure this is nice and cool it's completely cooled and if you want to put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes after it comes out of the oven be my guest but make sure you've got it nice and cooled and then we're going to add this incredible cream cheese whipping cream filling and now I added two teaspoons of vanilla in mind as I was whipping it when I was off-camera so that's really optional but I really think it gives it a punch of flavor all right and then we're just gonna spread this out now we're not gonna bake this this is a filling that we do not need to bake but what we do need to do is put it in the refrigerator covered for the next four hours or you may just do it overnight all right so I'm gonna get this covered and in the refrigerator for the next four hours and I'll come back and show you how I'm gonna top it I've just taken my cheesecake out of the refrigerator and it's set in the refrigerator overnight and I've taken a knife and I've gone around the edge of this cheesecake as you can see just really get down in there very good and then once we get this loosen and I've gone already all the way around you're gonna loosen your springform pan right here as you can see I'm going to pull it back okay and it loosens the sides of the pan just gonna jiggle it to the left to the right and now we're just gonna pull up and voila I'm gonna go ahead and start topping it with the berries and see it's gonna really add he's here to your cream cheese in your whipping cream I'll be back I'll cut into it taste it and tell you what it's like and I can it's gonna be summertime delicious I've added my strawberries my blueberries my raspberry on to the slice of this fabulous delicious very very summertime cheesecake and I want to show

"SY3NMdNCimY": "[Music] hey how's it going everybody and welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to show you how to make some blueberry cheesecake mousse cubs this cute little dessert is light and refreshing and perfect for entertaining so without further delay let's get to it to start we need to blend our fresh blueberries to get a blueberry puree so add your blueberries to a high-powered blender or food processor and pulse them until your puree is as fine as you can get it [Music] proceed to strain your puree through a fine mesh strainer in order to remove the unwanted skin and then set the puree aside for later next dissolve the gelatin powder in the water and let it rest for a few minutes microwave this mixture on high for 30 seconds and then let it cool on the counter while you continue on with the rest of the set add your whipping cream to a stand mixer and then with the whisk head beat until the whipping cream starts to form soft peaks then add a quarter cup of powdered sugar and continue beating until hard peaks form [Music] at this point you can transfer the now whipped cream into another bowl and let it cool in the fridge next clean your mixing bowl and then add to it your cream cheese and the rest of the powdered sugar switch to the mixer head and stir until just combined stop the mixer add the vanilla extract and then proceed to mix thoroughly stop the mixer once more and using a spatula push the cream cheese mixture into the center of the bowl add the blueberry puree we made earlier followed by the gelatin mixture and then mix on high until thoroughly combined you you Oh remove the cheese and blueberry mixture from the mixer and by hand fold one third of the whipped cream into the cheese mixture proceed to add the rest of the whipped cream into the mixture fold it until it's combined and then let it rest in the fridge you to make a cookie crumb base layer for this cheesecake mousse simply melt your butter in the microwave add it to your graham cracker crumbs and then stir it until it's completely mixed you don't need to add the cookie crumb layer to enjoy the mood but I think it adds a pleasant little texture proceeded to spoon your cookie crumb base layer evenly into your mini pudding cup remove the cheesecake mousse from the fridge and transfer it to a piping bag I recommend trying this cup method as it trivializes this step pipe an equal amount of the cheesecake mousse into each cup and then tap them down until the mixture settles completely you finally decorate the top with a bit of whipped cream some leftover blueberries and a mint leaf for some added Flair and voila you have a beautiful blueberry cheesecake mousse cup that will fool your friends and family away they will definitely fall in love with the delightful light texture and the fresh natural berry flavor I'd say that the mission accomplished [Music] anyway thank you so much for watching my video and I hope you really enjoyed it please thumbs

how to make these blueberry cheesecake macarons these taste phenomenal guys I don't actually like eating berries like blueberries I just have never liked them but I do like the way that they taste and I'm a fan of blueberry pies and these taste blueberry ish which makes sense because there's blueberry in them let's get stuck into the rest of you guys this is how you make them okay guys so we're going to start off with the macaron so you want to pop your powdered sugar and almond meal into a food processor you want to pulse that a couple times get everything nice and mixed and then what you're gonna do is you're going to transfer that to a bowl but you're gonna run it for a sip this is something new that I'm trying out it's in an effort to get my macarons a little bit smoother you don't have to do it but it's optional well that goes without saying make a little well in the center and add your first batch of egg whites measuring 110 grams you're going to mix that in there until everything comes together and forms a paste then you will cover it with some plastic wrap and set it aside next we're gonna move on to making the syrup so add your water and sugar into a sauce small saucepan you're gonna let that come to a gentle boil and bring it to a 115 degrees Celsius I'm using a candy thermometer to help me do this now when you reach 115 you're gonna put your second batch of egg whites into a stand mixer or you can use a hand mixer get those nice and frothy using the whisk attachment then you're gonna very slowly and in a thin and steady stream pour that very hot syrup into the egg whites while the mixer is on high speed once it's all in there add your vanilla some blueberry essence some pink food Oh purple food Jo and blue food gel scrape down the bowl and continue mixing until you get a nice thick and glossy meringue all up it should take about six to seven minutes you're gonna add a spatula full of that meringue to your almond mixture from earlier on you're going to mix that in make sure it's mixed really really well then you're going to add the rest of your meringue now this is the point where a lot of people go wrong it's where the disaster happens in the mixing stage so I like to use a spatula and go around the bowl and then through the middle and what this does is it deflates the mixture slowly slowly so that you end up with a little bit thinner mixture and you get to what I call the ribbon stage so continue mixing until you get to the point where the butter falls off the spatula in a ribbon and disappears back into the mixture after about ten seconds now you want to line a baking tin with some baking paper or I'm using a silicon mat we're gonna pipe our macarons about three centimeters in width we're going to gently tap the Train three times let these dry for about thirty to sixty minutes and then you want to bake them on 180 degrees Celsius for about eight to ten minutes once they're baked let them cool down completely now I'm going to be using some edible color spray I'm going to be using some violet or purple and some blue spray as well so once you finish spraying all of your macarons set them aside to dry completely next I'm going to move on to making my cream-cheese frosting you can find the recipe for this on my website [Music] so once you've made it you want to add some blueberry essence and some blueberry jam in there make sure you scrape down the ball at least once to make sure everything mixes properly and then continue mixing until it's evenly mixed I'm using a small French tip to frost my macarons in a swirl before I sandwich them with another macaron shell and guys that is pretty much it okay guys so those were my blueberry cheesecake macarons I hope you enjoyed watching this video if you did make

going on you guys doing all right okay I hope you're all doing very well so tonight I've got a special surprise for you guys my wife made me one of her world-famous homemade cheesecakes this is a blueberry cheesecake with some fresh blueberries on top this is gonna be so good she asked me the other day if I wanted a cheesecake so I could do a cheesecake video and I said yeah anyway so that's what we're gonna do today a nice blueberry cheesecake and of course I've got my coffee just plain black coffee just the way I like it so I brought me a plate here to put the cheesecake on while I cut it cuz I think I'm probably gonna make a mess that's alright though right probably gonna make a mess and I just washed my little my little blanket that I put on my table here so don't mind me I'm in a really goofy mood tonight it's been a long day I just got off of work not too long ago and and I opened up the fridge and saw my cheesecake in there so let me tell you what let me see if I can hold it up to the camera and give you guys a nice view hopefully nothing this is this is dangerous here so I'm living on the edge but I should be able to hold it up no problem hopefully you guys will get a nice view of it okay here we go okay so I wanted to put it on this this plate so hopefully you guys could get a good view of it while I got it so here we go homemade blueberry cheesecake some black coffee I want you guys to sit back relax put your feet up don't worry about a thing just hang out with me for a while the one thing this cheesecake reminds me of is this little tiny restaurant my mom and I and my sister used to go to a long time ago when we were just little kids my mom used to take us there on our way to West Virginia to to visit our relatives so I thought I'd tell you that little story and and eat my cheesecake just hang out with you guys for a while but um let me just take it real quick minute check these mics make sure they're set up okay and then I'll get started yeah let's move that a little bit Jack that cable make sure that's nice this one looks good this one always looks good cuz I don't I don't really bother this one too much just move that filter up a little bit there we go okay you guys ready now this is gonna be the tricky part is trying to cut this because you know when you cut into a pie or cheesecake the first piece is always the hardest to get out of the container here so let's see mm-hmm I can hear that graham cracker crust just crunching away can you tell I'm excited I've got like four plates that up here I don't even know which one's gonna be for which but here we go let's see if I can get this out of here yeah not too bad there now I'll try and hold this up so you guys can see that let's see if I can give you guys a good view of what the actual inside looks like as well so here's a good view of the actual the inside of the Cheesecake this is gonna be so good here's my fork all right here we go I don't know how much noiz cheesecake is gonna make but it's probably some nice soft eating sounds so good so I think I might have mentioned that before I'm sure I did and in one of my earlier videos but most of my family my mom's relatives they live in West Virginia and I have three cousins they're right around my my age so one was younger and two of them were a little bit older but we used to go there every summer to visit so it was me and my mom and my sister and and then my aunt and uncle and the three cousins we would always go there and visit and my mom has a you know a pretty big family so it was just so much fun we would just play cards and play charades and my uncles would take me fishing and just all kinds of stuff but I think one of the funnest things about going there was the actual trip you know it was a long drive and and we always stopped at all the little stores and knickknacks shops and restaurants it just seemed like I don't know it was just so much fun but I remember we would start out at the the first stop we would always make was this little it was a gas station called Stuckey's you guys ever heard of a Stuckey's I think there's there's still quite a few of them around so if you've heard of Stuckey's or you have one close to your your home let me know because that was the coolest little store I would always buy just you know something the you know that I could do on the way there because it was like a 10 or 12 hour drive so I would buy like a comic book or a little matchbox racecar or something like that just something to do on the way yeah we always had dogs too at least one dog we'd take the dogs with us and we would always have to stop and walk them we'd stop at the rest area my mom would literally take a nap sometimes at the rest area cuz you know she was always you know nervous about driving and whatnot so we always wanted to make sure that she got plenty of rest so my sister and I we would play with the dogs my mom would take a little nap it was just yeah she would she would lay down right on top of a picnic table and just go to sleep so I don't think she she'd probably get away with that now this was playback and you know like the way back in the olden day it's like in the 1970s so but it was ok back then now you guys know I'm not gonna eat this one piece right so let's let's get another one going here now that I've got that first one out of there the the rest of them should come out pretty easy sorry guys I guess I just just been a long day that's all right don't we all like to laugh right that's the one thing you know my my wife she she makes me these cheesecakes and you know we really enjoy being together but I tell you what when my wife and I get together it's just like a lot of the times we just laugh and laugh and laugh over the the smallest little thing it could be anything and that's what I really like most about our relationship that's were we just enjoy being together and and we laugh a lot my wife she's always the jokester she's joking around about everything I thought that was gonna give me a problem season conquer right those fresh blueberries just make it so good yeah so we would always stop at this little tiny restaurant was called the Lancaster in it's probably not around anymore it's seems like some of the the best restaurant small little tiny home-cooked meals and you know just neighborhood restaurants there they don't seem to last too long but they've got the best food but this Lancaster in they had the best pies and cheesecakes add apple pie and cherry pie and every type of cheesecake you could imagine they had cherry cheesecake and strawberry and blueberry mom would take us there every single time we went to West Virginia we would always make it a point to stop at the Lancaster end and I would always get the blueberry cheesecake every single time it was so good and it didn't bother me we might have went there ten summers in a row and all 10 times we went I would get the blueberry cheesecake it was that good still working these crazy hours 12 hours every single day today one I'm gonna have one more little sliver and when I say sliver I mean there we go that looks like a sliver close enough one last little piece I can get it out of here Oh tiny baby piece yeah my mom's doing good though she's gonna turn 90 this year so she still lives in the house that we grew up in I stopped over there about you know once or twice a week just to check in on her make sure she's doing okay take her groceries and whatnot cuz it you know this whole pandemic ordeal I don't really want her going anywhere so before all this happened you know she she still drives and she goes off to the grocery store and goes to church and whatnot so but I want to make sure she stays safe so I don't I don't want her going out anywhere so I just take her whatever she needs and and she's fine with that for now I'm sure she wants to get out but you know we'll see hopefully things get better really soon and everything will be back to normal it's kind of weird cuz my my wife's mom she's gonna be 90 this year too so my mom and my wife's mom they're about six weeks apart and age isn't that strange

"QR0lggO5AFU": "hi guys today I want to tell you about Julia Co cocaine that I found on Instagram and I really loved all of her photos she makes really beautiful food photography she shares her recipes on her Instagram account and I've tried I've had a chance to try actually only one of her recipes and I changed quite many things in that recipe but today I'm making it like in her recipe and I want to share this recipe with you guys this recipe is for a cheesecake with blueberries and here is a photo of Julia's cheesecake so the color is amazing when I made a first time I was so surprised how beautiful it looks and today I want to share it so all of you can make this recipe if you like food photography and if you love or like cheese cakes check out Julia's Instagram profile I will link the direct link to her profile in the description box and now let's get started base of the cheesecake you can put the cookies in a plastic bag just be careful to hold it close and let all the air out and you can use a spatula to crush the cookies you can also do this in a blender if you want [Music] so wonder the cookie crumbs look like this and then if you make it in a back like me just check that the back is not broken from anywhere by the cookies and then you can add the melted butter to the bag and then just mix the butter with a big foam just make sure that all of the ticket crumbs are covered with the butter then I have here a spring formal mold that I've laid with baking paper in the recipe Julia says you can leave the baking paper out but I prefer to use it because I found it easier to remove the cheesecake from the form afterwards and then just pour over the cake the cake my cookie crumbs then just with the spatula the crumbs evenly at the bottom of the form so once you press it nicely so that the crumbs come together and they kind of start to form the base and now you want to bake the base for about 10 minutes so the base has been baked now and now I will leave it to cool once you have heated blueberries and they've all melted so they're not frozen anymore as you can see and they've released a lot of juice so I want to run the blueberries through the sea you get a smooth blueberry juice or puree just be careful because can be messy so you've got all of the juice and puree out of the blueberries just leave the blueberry juice or blueberry puree to cool now that the base and blueberry puree is cool we can start to make the filling I'm using low-fat Philadelphia you can also use full fat one for premiere cheesecake [Music] adding the sugar and now we want to mix the cream with the sugar on low setting until it's all incorporated we adding the eggs one at a time I'm mixing again on the low setting now I'm gonna add creme fraiche there has to be called for sour cream that has to be 30% fat but I couldn't find that so I thought creme fraiche should be the same [Music] and I'm gonna cold blueberry pray and lastly a lot two tablespoons of cornstarch and give it a mix again [Music] recipe Julia also uses lemon juice but again I forgot to go buy that so I'm not using any lemon juice this time gonna butter the sides of the form and I'm actually not quite sure whether it will fit into the form that I'm using we'll see I decided to use much smaller this one or this time I used last time I was 20 centimeters this time I decided to use smaller I think this is 17 but we'll see we'll fit as much as we can so also one tip you should save the cornstarch because I didn't and now I can see some some pieces still there but I hope it's gonna be fine surprised it actually did fit into the 17 centimeter form I will probably need to adjust the baking time just slightly so it'll bake it bake it for an extra 10 minutes I think because it's a slightly higher but now I need to prepare some hot water because you put you need to put a form with hot water in the oven with the cheesecake make the Cheesecake yesterday and unfortunately it's cracked but I think it's because it's getting quite cold here and maybe I remove this from the oven a little bit too early because it was quite warm so after you've baked the cheesecake you want to leave it in the oven I will have the exact instructions in the description box but mine wasn't - mine wasn't cool enough I think when I removed it from the oven so that's why it cracked but still I will decorate it and it will look beautiful so now we will be removing it from the baking tin I have hot water here and a knife I will dip the knife in the hot water and then run the knife along the edges [Music] [Music] [Music] hairiness it's not looking as gorgeous as Ullaeus but I think with some practice it will get there but the color looks gorgeous as I promised on the picture now I'll put the cake on the cake stand you can leave the cake like this or you can decorate it if you want because mine cracked unfortunately in the middle I'm going to decorate with some berries and fruits so I'm going to cover this this bit that cracked I hope you liked this video and this recipe and I hope you will try baking this cake as well make sure you check out Ullaeus channel I will link her Instagram profile in the description box thank you for watching my video bye bye until next time [Music] make sure you check out Julia's account I will link the who I will link the link thank you for watching my video thank you for thank you very much ma what is wrong", "WPMFHhIBpzk": "hello my name is Ashley Chaplin I'm the vice president of Chapman's ice cream today we are going to make blueberry double cheesecake ice cream cake I'm gonna be using a ten inch springform cake pan then I've got this beautiful sunflower mold without I'm gonna make the Cheesecake ever pull out your ice cream and fill up your springform cake pit now we've got the entire 2-liter blueberry cheesecake ice cream into the cake pan you're gonna work the ice cream around the pan from the middle out making sure you get to all sides so now that we've got a pretty flat cake pan of ice cream pop it into the freezer we're gonna get started on our wild blueberry sauce take a pot of water about a cup and a half of wild blueberries that's been dried we're gonna throw a little bit of brown sugar in a nice little drop of natural vanilla extract give it a quick swish so we're just gonna leave that there for a bit next step we're gonna do is we're gonna grab our graham cracker crumbs we're gonna take about 115 125 milliliters of melted butter and simply just pour it in and all we're gonna do is just mix it up until it almost forms taste now that our blueberry ice cream has come down the temperature and is very very frozen what we're going to do is take our butter and graham mixture spoon it up now we're just gonna use our hands we're just gonna move the graham all over the place here so now that we have that all nice like that we pop it back into the freezer now our reduction is finally done as you can see to drive blueberries are all puffed up soft now we're gonna go check our ice cream because it's so cold we're gonna take little blowtorch and heat up the metal around the pan I'm gonna turn it kinda like this oh there we go but of course that's only half the job that's why I have a big piece of parchment here in the back flip that upside down and then of course we've got to go in with the blowtorch again in the back of my mouth here flip that upside down like that at this point carefully add it to the serving platter right in the dead center I am gonna go fetch our cheesecake from the fridge now because this is a lot more delicate than of course our ice cream cake we have to really be careful when we get it on top of here like carefully lift it up flip and carefully flip it on to the cookie crumbs on top of your platter then we're gonna pass the saw through the straining [Music] I'm just gonna take these wild blueberries put them all over the place now the final last step is just a touch of icing sugar so we're just gonna take a little sifter and let's just give it a nice little sprinkle of white a delicious Chapman blueberry double cheese cake ice cream cake enjoy [Music]", "9QCeXdLW05c": "I made these little mini cheesecake tarts with blueberry topping for dinner tonight and they're super easy to make they taste really good too in my bowl I have 2 8 ounce packages of cream cheese that has been softened to room temperature a cup of sugar a teaspoon of vanilla extract and two eggs I'm gonna go ahead and get this mixed up just mix it up until most of them locks I lined my muffin tin with the paper liners and placed one vanilla wafer in the bottom of each and I'm gonna divide the cream cheese mixture evenly you know I'm just gonna put it in a 350 degree oven and bake for 20 minutes this is what it looks like after baking for 20 minutes I'm gonna let it cool down a little bit and then get it into the refrigerator and chill it for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight then I just used a can guess it's a 21 ounce can of blueberry pie filling you could use whatever flavor you want cherry pie filling whatever and I just topped them so this is the blueberry cream cheese tart [Music]", "H8rkkHahr4o": "have some cream cheese in my bowl I have this kind of cream cheese one package in my bowl it's been sitting out for a couple hours we're gonna mix it up okay I think I have that mixed up and my second ingredient is going to be sweetened condensed milk sweetened condensed milk so this is real thick this is not evaporated milk pop this open see how nice and thick it's real sweet very sweet I'll get all this in there and I'll get the rest out off of camera you want to mix this up very very well for Oh couple three minutes all right I have that all mixed up now this is super sweet because of that sweetened condensed milk we want to add some lemon juice yeah that'll counteract it make it taste what we're good - believe it or not okay so lemon juice I mixed in for about Oh 45 seconds now I have one of these store-bought graham cracker croaker graham cracker crust this is a simple easy easy dessert just so easy and very very delicious I got this from a co-worker of mine at Home Depot her name is Wendy so we're gonna put this in there smooth it out and I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator to kind of set up because that cream cheese will help it get it's not really hard but kind of stiff again kind of like a cheesecake so into the refrigerator I've had this in the refrigerator for about an hour and you can put any kind of topping you want to on this I'm using pie filling that comes in a can using blueberry you use cherry is excellent strawberry you put fresh strawberries on top just anything you want just kind of spread that around I'm going to take the lid that came with it came like this and let's turn it upside down just let this sit in there for another two hours for four hours total to really let it you
