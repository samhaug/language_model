{"FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "G6zWcc-gdaY": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at our second product from SAS this time we are looking at their 240 milligram a tangerine flavored product we already reviewed their strawberry lemon-aid I believe it was 240 milligrams and I loved it it might be my favorite drink yet it cost me $20 at my dispensary which is great value for drinks especially of this potency so I've got a lot of high hopes for this tangerines ASP as well so we got to shake well I've already went ahead and opened it up just because I found the last one difficult to open and didn't want to bore you to death with just me sitting here trying to open this product so we've got this a spear ready to go oh I also remember that it did not taste very well very good the strawberry lemonade was really really strong I almost tasted more like a syrup in terms of like potency or strength than it did a beverage so that is because it is small it's only 8.4 fluid ounces which is about half the size of the other drinks and it is the most potent drink I've seen at 240 milligrams so it does have a lot to pack in there for such a small package so let's go ahead and open it up and give it a drink give it a taste and if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna drink this product I drink the whole thing not necessarily all of it in front of you but I will drink the whole thing and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process so let's open her up here nice and orange coat got to shake well tells you 900 times on this bottle to shake well so that's we shall do well shaken dripping a little alright here we go well shook ins ASP very tangerine e flavored and there comes that we D strength woo so strong so potent Wow woo alright guys this is just as strong tasting as the strawberry lemonade which is a double-edged sword doesn't taste very good but probably means it's quite potent so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you guys soon that my friends is two for two fours ASP I am high as hell rockin seven plus right now easily didn't really enjoy the taste of it oh and sorry about the audio on the first half of this video I have a nice mic i just stupidly forgot the pop filter dumb dumb dumb stupid stupid stupid shame shame shame on me me me but so I apologize for the audio quality that being said oh my god is a spand cannabis quencher are now neck and neck battling it out punching it out duking it out for first place in the beverage department cannabis quencher tastes way better but i think is a spaghett smiie higher i haven't yet tried their 120 or 111 days I think it's 120 to see if it's a you know sort of as literally as good if it's a half as good as this one because I know the both the cannabis quencher 100 and 200 milligrams are great but man this hits so hard it's great and I don't have enough nice things to say about how hard it hits and I don't really have enough I don't wanna say something too negative about how it tastes because it's not horrific horrific it's just they call it highly refreshing which come on guys come on this is nobody's gonna call this beverage refreshing it's I mean that it it objectively tastes bad but you know its flavored okay it's you're gonna be able to get through it yeah you're not gonna enjoy it you're not going to enjoy the cannabis quencher either just as a point of reference but you're not gonna hate it as much as this this is hard to get through but if when you do oh my god is it worth it and that's the most important thing you know is as long as it gets you super super medicated or super super high in the end you know the the few moments of anguish in this case it's so such a small beverage you know it's so easy to get through go for it go for it I highly recommend it so guys I again if you see this at a dispensary near you and you're at all interested in beverages grab zas III think I like the strawberry lemonade flavor better than the tangerine but you know it's really up to you whatever you prefer and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later review peace", "oOL-_2jmZ4Y": "[Applause] [Music]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm here with my son we're gonna test a 11 pitch propeller with the hydrofoil I'm running light no cooler just snacks diapers fuel tank battery and life vests that's it I can already tell that my idle speed I'm going a lot faster then I used to with the 9 pitch propeller [Music] so to my surprise I'm running the same speed 18 miles per hour but at lower rpm at 4400 rpm that's the max throttle rpm I'm getting I guess too much torque for the engine I run at 18 miles per hour at 5400 rpm with nine pitch propeller getting 18 miles per hour again I'm gonna take off the hydrofoil and see if I'll go faster [Music] I took the hydrofoil off and same results 18 miles per hour same speed I actually had better acceleration with the mine so I think the nine the nine point nine is not ready for the 11 pitch propellers so it will have to be for a 15 or maybe a 20 when I upgrade it to 20 horsepower then I'll save that propeller for that thing is uh I can clean at a lower rpm like a very nice cruising speed and the engine is much wider I'm going to put the 9 inch pitch propeller back on I like it a faster acceleration I just don't have the court prettiest propeller yet so I'm gonna keep the mind back on and I'm gonna save the 11 for later in the future maybe 4 years from now after warranty expired I'm gonna turn it into a 20 horsepower then I'll put the 11 pitch propeller on yeah I was curious to try I get to a nice cruising speed I'm playing at I guess I'm saving fuel because I'm gonna lower rpm but I don't know more torque T I'm gonna show [Music] so these right here it's and I'm like just over half a trouble [Music] but it does feel compared to the nine a little bit sluggish like on acceleration it's not bad but I think I prefer the nine same top speed at the end I just don't know if I'll be burning more fuel I guess even those are lower rpm we dis propeller", "D5ECVNMIl3s": "the Goldfield fan this is a rainy

tangerine introduced of about 1931 from Orlando Florida and has become quite the popular variety Mineola is always distinguished by the little nipple at the top of the fruit that seems to be a very common characteristic of all Mineola tangelos and unlike other grapefruit hybrids and grapefruit alone Minneola tangelo doesn't interfere with the uptake of Medicine so this makes it a great citrus variety for people who are concerned about eating grapefruit and having to interfere with the uptake of their particular medicine Mineola is another early ripening piece of fruit so here it is mid-december here in California it's just getting into it's right period right now very interesting piece of fruit the way it eats cut open the Mineola has a very obvious look to it and as you can see beautiful orange flesh but again it always comes down to one thing doesn't it and it always comes down to flavor so what is a Mineola tangelo all about hmm I can tell you it's a beautiful mix of acid and sugar and has a almost grapefruit orange flavor to it very very unique it's really easy to understand why this is such a popular variety of citrus the Mineola tangelo", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

chocolate covered blueberries i got them at new era dispensary down the street on north avenue in chicago check them out for you know your next your next run um but these actually these costs about 40

tasting edibles i've had and i've had a lot of edibles recently with it being legal in chicagoland area so not bad not bad um so we're gonna wait about an hour and come back and and see how i feel um because you know sometimes i've had 5 milligrams of thc you know i'm gone and then other times i can't feel things so we're going to see how i feel when we get back what's up guys so it's been about 55 minutes since we've taken the five milligram thc edible now again i i take it about i take i take edibles you know almost every day so it's different effect on me depending on the day it's been a while since i've had an edible but yeah this is giving me pretty high feeling it's uh it's hard to explain obviously but uh yeah good a good effect i would definitely recommend uh this is and now i'm

time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll catch you on a future one peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel

we'll check you guys out on the next video", "2l3xFaS8vOY": "I'm gonna get stoned first thing in the morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about your milligram egde shame on you for your stupid story that you have online about what a cool brand you are looking out for the customer and yadda-yadda you got a bunch of horseshit well you know what I'm sorry I said all that I would love to talk to you guys if any one of you wants to come on wheats and talk about your products and and and tell me why I'm wrong and maybe show me the show me the batch that got lab tested so I can see for myself that you actually do what you say and I would love to talk to you guys and I promise I'll be I'll be fair and and equitable with you so I'd love to have you on email me wheats reviews at gmail.com or wheats at wheats reviews calm hit me up on Twitter Facebook whatever I'd love to talk to you guys again give you a chance to to you know have your own to have your sake because I think that's important too but my say is they're bad I think this is a bad product from a dis reputable company I'm sorry but I think it's true Cushie edibles mega pass from me mega mega pass gross taste and misleading milligram egde Oh bummer bummer bummer bummer another we've had like four or five bad ones in a row I feel like who well it's um gold we'll strike gold soon we'll find we'll find that diamond in the rough I'm sure here on weeds but we've had a string of bad ones but that can only mean good things ahead and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching sorry I've been such a downer on this review I it bums me out when I have to bum anybody else out but you know I do what I can alright guys well whatever that means thank you so much for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace", "vgWlkfz2hsc": "[Music] hey guys so today today i'm going to be taking a 200 milligram edible and do my makeup oh yeah i just got out the shower so i have a baggy t-shirt on and my hair is wet obviously the edibles that i'm going to take i took out the little card but this is the edible i already took these three but with these three i cut them in half i took one hole like a couple days ago [ __ ] is crazy but the other two i cut them in half and like took half the dose but this is a 200 milligram edible um this is the card it literally says this super potent gummy is 200 milligrams strong the company suggests that patients should begin with one candy at a time and adjust as they become familiar with the effects this product is segmented into four candies so dosage can be well managed i'm going to take the edible now but it does take an hour to activate so i'm going to eat the edible on camera chill my bed time it for an hour and come back an hour and doing makeup so that's what we're gonna do the only thing i don't like about these gummies is that it's a little hard to chew it's super super hard but honestly like they're nuts so this is it it's obviously like lemon flavor and it's a little alien the freaking alien design should say how like strong it is but [Music] like i can't even chew it i have to really just pluck on it but i'm gonna put coconut oil in my hair oh my god i'm gonna cut the video because i'm gonna be chewing this for the next 10 minutes because this is how hard it is i'll see you in an hour it is 12 30 right now so i'll see ya at 1 30. okay so it's been an hour um yeah all right so i'm gonna start doing my makeup all right i'm not even gonna lie when i'm when i'm high my voice gets really low like really really low so that's just yeah okay i want to play music so bad right now because i love like listening to music when i'm high but i'm gonna get copyrighted i'm doing my eyebrows with this palette even though i have my mirror in front of me um i'm gonna use this mirror because it's closer and my eyebrows need to be precise i've done my makeup hard before but like it always comes out like fine all right so what should i talk about because i don't want to just stay here silently oh almost look about the first time i got high okay i don't remember [ __ ] okay so when i first got high it was [Music] pretty sure was my 18th birthday i think it was like after it was like a week after my 18th birthday at the time one of my close friends at the time she had already like smoked she was already like into it so she knew what she was doing um and her best friend like also like my friend her best friend and her sister so they all like knew what they were doing already um i had always been like really nervous to get high because i was like i don't know how i'm gonna act i don't know like how i'm feel because you can explain to people how it feels but you don't know what it feels like until you feel it oh i was like i already had like my like like i guess my my stigma about it i don't know i had my own opinions about it but i was like [ __ ] it i'm 18 like let me just try at least i wanted to at least try it because i was like okay then i can know if i like it or not i went to her house and i don't know i don't remember if we planned on doing it or not but i think they had planned on doing it and i was just gonna like chill out but then eyebrow okay i said i do my makeup better when i'm high but my eyebrows coming out a little funky so whatever she lives like five minutes away from me not even like a two second walk and i'm at her house so i got to her house and they started to smoke and we were all in a circle they were so we were like a little diamond i guess and i was sitting there like hella nervous because i was like yo i said oh my god when i was like nervous because i was like am i gonna do this right like am i gonna smoke this right until i was like what's gonna happen to me i was like [ __ ] up so i think i think me having anxiety prior to even smoking is what caused my experience so i was like freaking out whatever and it gets past me and like they spent like five minutes trying to teach me how to do it right because we had done it before the first time i really really smoked i didn't do it right so i felt a little bit but i didn't feel like anything compared to the time i'm talking about right now did that make sense so whatever they spent like five minutes trying to like teach me how to do it and i was convinced i wasn't doing it right i was like nah i'm not doing this right i don't feel [ __ ] because in my head i'm thinking oh it's supposed to be like an immediate feeling because when they were doing when my friends were doing it they i could already tell they were snacks i was like what the [ __ ] so whatever i passed this for her sister circle kept going right it goes to i don't know if they care if i use their name and i'm just saying that i'm like i'm like this like i'm like yo what's happening right now and i'm like i'm not realizing that that's what i'm feeling that i'm feeling hot in my head i'm thinking like am i laced because i didn't know that that was the feeling you got they when they explained to me that you felt like what i what you would feel what i would feel i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm chatting about right now they were like basically saying you feel calm you feel high like they don't know how else to explain it because it's like i don't you don't really know how to explain it to a person i'm too smack right now um where was i oh yeah so it gets past and i'm sitting there like confused as to what's going on because i didn't know that that that feeling i was feeling was the feeling i was feeling high so i'm sitting there like yo guys i'm like freaking out and i go i think i go on the bed and i just sit and i'm like i'm like looking out the window i'm like yo i like in that moment it felt like i was in heaven but because the sun was sitting and it was coming through her window so i'm looking at the sun like so i'm looking out the window like yo i'm in heaven right now and they're just laughing at me because i was saying like nonsense it did y'all i feel like this looks bad they were just laughing at me because i was saying like a bunch of nonsense and i don't have the video from that day because it was in my old snap and everything i deleted but um i was basically like just bugging out i was like i feel like i'm talking to computers going off and they were like yo are you good and i was like i was like no i like i knew i wasn't good i wasn't good to where i was like unsafe but i wasn't good because i like i wasn't comprehending that this is what you feel it was my first time one and two i didn't know like what to expect [Music] so in my mind i'm convinced at that point i'm convinced i just got leased and it's not i wasn't thinking that because of them or anything i was thinking that because again i didn't know that that was how i was supposed to feel so so i was asking them i was like yo is mine different like i don't know i was like yo did i smoke something different because i don't know like i feel crazy i was saying like i feel crazy because everything was just like yo okay that took a lot of concentration she asked me she was like is this your first time getting house like like yes bro i was so like frustrated because i was like i was like oh my god i was like i don't know what to do they were living their best life they were enjoying it but i was just so paranoid and i wasn't enjoying it at all like it honestly it really wasn't a fun experience for me because my anxiety was just like getting the best of me i was just getting hella paranoid and my anxiety was just through the roof and i was just sitting in the corner like yo like i wasn't crying but in my head i was because i was like oh my gosh and then like when it like hit me that this is like me being high what was i saying i forgot what the [ __ ] i was saying oh yeah i was like i was just hella paranoid i like i didn't know what to do with myself and at one point i was like when does this end i was asking them like yo when does this [ __ ] end because i just didn't want to be high anymore i was like i'm over this like this is no um and they were like give it like another like four or five hours because like at the time i had never smoked before so it was gonna last a long time not smoke that much compared to now if i would have smoked that now i would have been like okay like can i get another one that was my first time getting high i was hella paranoid i had hella anxiety i told some of my friends the story they're like they're like so if you had that bad experience why do you continue to smoke and like [Music] eat edibles on [ __ ] camera for youtube um honestly i tried it again after that because i was like i was like okay i need to have a better experience because i truly feel like in that moment all i was doing was just panicking and like questioning everyone and like just acting like annoying so i was like okay i want to experience this again because i want to learn how to just like be okay and just enjoy it instead of like freaking the [ __ ] out so i ended up trying it again and the second time it was the second time the second time was a way better experience it was a lot more fun we actually went out and did stuff so i was cool what gets me tight when i meet people and i'm like oh like do you smoke heavy smoke before they're like yeah i've smoked before but i i didn't feel anything so it don't work for me i'd be like i mean i'd be like wrap it up because i'd be like one it's either you didn't smoke it right or two you didn't have actual weed because no you didn't have good weed i'm like i mean i says you didn't feel anything because you didn't smoke it right because if it's me if you're smoking weed you're gonna feel something especially if it's your first time so you death didn't do it right and i would know because the first actual time i did it i didn't do it right and i barely felt that i had like the giggles more because i was like oh my god how but like i didn't feel [ __ ] because i didn't do it right so that's why when people always say that [ __ ] i'm like i'm gonna teach you i'll be like i'm gonna teach you [ __ ] like i got you [Music] that water tastes so good i felt it okay so i'm gonna take laura mercier and set the concealer on my eyes i'm getting the munchies i was gonna order food while i was waiting but then i was like i was like no i want to wait so um like snack snack so i could crave food [Music] see now i was starting to hit like a brick before i was a little high i know i could have been hired and i was starting to hit me like a ton of bricks oh my god i don't know what i'm doing i don't know what i'm doing okay i'm gonna take this kylie bronzer [Music] and use it as a little eyeshadow to dust off the translucent powder [Music] the indian asked oh what the indian clay mask i need to do that oh i could talk about the story the time i took my first edible too that story was crazy first time i tried edible rape my friend that made it for me and my mom they were both telling me they were like this is your first time eating edible so be careful just eat half and i was like alright yeah i was like i know like i was trying to act all big and bad like yeah i know like i'm just gonna eat half i saved it for like a day or two because i was like i want to wait to like so i know i don't have anything to do the whole day because if this is my first time i want to be home chilling whatever so i was home i ate the edible i had half like he said and then i was just sitting there and it's been 20 minutes wow i was just sitting there and i wasn't feeling anything like an hour pass and i wasn't feeling anything i was like i was like hello i was getting mad because i was like this is not working for me that's everyone's [ __ ] mistake when they take edibles it doesn't work for me it's not hidden [ __ ] i was just chilling and i was like you know what i'm gonna eat more so i practically ate the whole thing i left like a little slither left i ate the whole thing basically and i was like this should do it idiot not realizing what it's actually gonna do to me 30 minutes later it all hit at once and i was bugging out i ate like two no i ate a full down on those pizza i had wings i had a lava cake i had all that i had lava cake i had soda and i ate it all and i'm getting hungry my mom i knew i had ate half so she was just waiting so she came into my room like an hour after it officially hit me she was like you good i was like i was like i feel like i have super powers and she starts busting out laughing and i swore in that moment i had super hours and i was just like okay i'm bored i want to do something i was like really jumpy pretty sure because it it was sativa yeah i was like i want to do something i wanna like i wanna party so i started making i probably made like 20 dance videos that night of me just dancing in my bed and it wasn't even like real like choreography dancing i was just i was just filming myself doing like my goofy [ __ ] because when i when i add goofy i'll be doing nuts i look like crackit i literally convinced myself i was like i'm trapped here i'm never gonna be able to leave oh my god what the [ __ ] and then like as quick as it was for me to have those thoughts like even quicker for me to just get rid of those thoughts like i was thinking that and i was like oh my gosh i can't get up and then i was like [ __ ] yes you can and i was like just get up and i got up i ate the rest of whatever i didn't eat from domino's and i knocked out that sleep hit so different that was probably the best sleep i've ever had someone if someone i

contained within rewind the toner cartridge by pushing it away from you until it stops this will prevent any residual toner from falling out press the toner drive gear away from the cartridge lift up the holder and remove the toner cartridge once you remove the toner cartridge you will notice a small hole in the top of the toner hopper on the new cartridge there will be a nozzle that fits perfectly into the hole on top of the toner hopper lift the toner holder and place the cartridge securely in its spot making sure that the toner holder lays flat give it two full rotations towards you to open the cartridge you do not need to move the drive gear the machine will bring that back as necessary close the hatch and you're done", "PoDEhYvmUz8": "[Music] so where we help you make sense of your dispensary YouTube's first and only marijuana edible review show that might be true I don't know there might be somebody else doing it but we definitely have the most videos so take that whether what you will today guys we are taking our look at our final look at cannabis quencher at least for now we are gonna take a look at their 200 milligram old-fashioned lemonade here from cannabis quencher this is I believe the fourth maybe the fifth review we've done from them I've loved all of their products I'm gonna go and take a rest after this one if this one's great we know that cannabis quencher is a-okay and we can stick with them if they release new products in the future we might take a look at them but this will be our last look at cannabis quencher and so guys this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna drink this bad boy some bit of it in front of you let you know how it tastes I'll be sure to drink it all over the next few minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you actually know how it's feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process or in this case the drinkable review process so let's take a look here at cannabis quencher you can see here this vegan gluten free product ooh-la-la we've got the gondolier on the back again I still have no idea what the gondolier has to do with cannabis glacier pieces life like most drinks these days is just too complicated take a trip back into simpler times with our old-style lemonade I intend to shake well let's go back to older simpler and more high times lemonade lemonade lemonade weed weed weed weed that's the way be focus right there oh no it's May design here to rescue somebody fire department actually get em boys I'm gonna finish this and I will see you guys in two hours let you know how we're feeling and I gotta say this might have the most pleasant and least weeds the aftertaste of any of the cannabis quencher products so far so that's good I will see you guys in two hours though to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis quencher 200 milligram lemonade and I am more than happy to tell you it's just as good as all the other cannabis quenchers all the flavors uniformly excellent do not hesitate to grab cannabis quencher if you're not afraid of trying a drink at a dispensary near you I think they're great they're a little bit pricier than the confectionaries but but they are good for a nice change of pace and they're not quite as filling as the sort of confectionaries like the brownies and cookies as well so I like them as a good alternative here and there and the cannabis quencher is the sort of drink that I now go for when I would like a bowl that excuse me a drinkable I'm gonna go with cannabis quencher so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw this at the camera I'm just gonna do that hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "rzZ1kVL3FPA": "whoop smoothie smoothie smoothie smoothie smoothie are we are we up we talking noises being made it's been a while since I've done this before it's been a while since I have done this so I am a little rusty guys but I am back whoa whoa well what hey Brittish and buttery what is up me out welcome welcome everyone to our 4200 lines what's the word subscribers that's the word heyy Thank You Cubs welcome welcome jack daniel\u00b4s welcome a man how are you I have been doing well sir so we are here again to celebrate the big 420 plus another 0 Wayne cook welcome Ethan Pfeiffer welcome as well we are here to celebrate that 4,200 and the way we always do it and we do it with a little bit of panache my panache I mean a [ __ ] ton of THC so what do we have on the docket today guys well I have found the kirova 50 my not 50 150 succeeded the crew of a black bars my go to thousand milligrams edibles I have not been able to find any um uh yes I am and good to see you buddy Hey good to see you man so good to see you Carlos it's been a long time I I am back uh oh you bought Mario Kart nice yes I have been away guys and I am so sorry that I have been away um I have been working on will get all into this during the livestream here uh yes so we'll get more into the details where I've been what's coming up for wheats all that good stuff but let's go back into what we'll be doing this evening so all the great Carabas out there the thousand milligrams are gone um roba isn't really dipping into the UH isn't really dipping into the black market as some other companies still are in the edible market you can still find whoops kicked my computer there you can still find plenty of things that are over the hundred milligram cap that's here in California um but uh kuba is not one of them kirova and now strictly making everything legal by the book in fact crow is even making flour they have their own flour I have some of it here butter you can question I actually am streaming from my Mac so I don't have twitch set up I don't have a restream so kirova has even moved over to the dark side they're selling just straight-up flour how and very very very fancy cases I mean this packaging is absolutely absurd you don't need that much expensive packaging for somebod but I mean it's it really is beautiful so what we are doing today is not the kirova how nice Ethan what we're doing today is the thousand milligram I can find uh cumin thanks Carlos we'll see you again soon see on twitch men um yes so we are doing the enjoy enjoyable edibles thousand milligram blackout brownies so it even has a similar name to our friends there at Koroma I find enjoyable to be up-and-down I find from their products to be really good and some to be not so good so we'll also be doing a little bit of a review on this thousand milligram edible in the meantime to see if it's worth its weight and salt I picked this up in a dispensary in Wilmington California right next to Long Beach Long Beach doesn't really have much in the way of black market dispensaries they only have the legal dispensaries even sure you can get them legal stuff through black markers up through delivery services I know that still exists but I went down to Wilmington where there are still tons of people willing to sell you black market animals and I picked this up for a pretty reasonable forty dollars for a thousand milligram animal and if it really is a thousand milligrams for forty bucks is a pretty good deal and something to really look forward to for those people who need that you know higher medication that higher dosage edible okay um oh yes and Jack Daniels asked when we are gonna release a new vid that is a great question and we are gonna get all to that new bids are coming new vids aren't coming uh-oh its it is that bread and butter yeah I just it should still be who vard it I just don't have it up right now alright let's get into this brownie let's get the show started here if I could tear it open all three of my dogs are in here with me and if you guys haven't tuned in before the studio is gone some over gone over some massive changes yet again the wheats HQ but I like to set up now here will give you a little tour maybe you can see the pups - here's the new studio there's the old gumball machine you guys know and love TV there's a dog hiding down there there's a dog hiding over there and there's a dog right here three dogs in this tiny little wheat studio a little cramped in here don't have the a/c on uh yes Jack Daniels I have gotten all three of yes four runnerguy I plan to do lots more lots more cart reviews and Josh welcome to the stream and glad you are here so yes uh gonna do more cart reviews and Jack Daniels asked if I'm going to give any to my dogs because I have plenty I will not be intentionally giving any to my dogs but I have gotten all three of my dogs hi accidentally at different points the great Dame the big one right there the big great one I got her super high I she ate a 250 milligrams edible off of a counter because she's tall enough to do so my bad uh and she got uh super high I felt really really bad but she was high for about 36 hours like I had to carry her down the stairs kind of hi hey Mark welcome in so glad you're here um how was the dog acting she was well she's a couch potato to begin with so Fraga say as a crop thank you so much Ben I appreciate that um so uh she snuck up ate it and then she just literally was immobilized for 36 hours she could have moved she was just drooling kind of glazed over in her eyes just constantly drooling so for about the next day and a half my my partner I had to sort of carry her down the stairs and let her go pee but she's fine now she's been on a few other small trips in the meantime all right I have not osha jack daniel\u00b4s ass um we missed your videos thank you so much tell us more funny super stoner moments I'll get to those and if I tried ketamine since I have not done any more ketamine since I took it back in May but I am still very optimistic and positive about my experience with ketamine and would recommend anybody who has their resources and is willing to do something a little bit of interest to try it it's it's uh especially again if you have any sort of you know if you if you you have problems with depression it uh it is a solution um it might not be for everybody but but it it definitely works some miracles for me so here is our black out brownie so uh yes and I'm glad your dog is okay Cubs um so glad to see yes and I'm so glad to see mark that some of the old faces are here too so glad to see all my old buddies um yeah it is it is absolutely legit the clinic I went to was really really um top-of-the-line very professional very it definitely seemed like a medical service instead of a drug trip um so I keep promising gonna take about you this let's do it ooh kakie well shut your [ __ ] mouth frog god damn dog alright thanks David I really appreciate that and nameless welcome welcome from being hi uh I've never heard of dxn Jack Daniels never heard of DXM I've heard of DMT but Wow um so Ethan says it tastes like a regular Brown this is a very kinky style browning um a lot less fudgy a considerably less fudgy than the kirova brownies they're like um those are have a lot more fudgy sort of stick to your teeth crystal welcome welcome welcome we're glad you are here so this one's much worth taking much easier to get down like you don't it just doesn't stick to your teeth a on time hey welcome great so you don't just sit there and lick it off your teeth which is wonderful it doesn't have nearly as strong about cannabis taste as as the kuriboh does but that's not this is a good thing it does have a cannabis taste especially an aftertaste but doesn't have that just awful just a stringent makes you want to like sandpaper kind of taste that the thousand milligram gorillas do I can definitely eat this whole thing and not feel like throwing up it's not good it's not good but it's not terrible and like always I have my trusty Arnold Palmer here to wash all this [ __ ] down of course it is nameless Hey welcome see SAPO Sam right I am doing good man Wow I won't take a look for that Jack Ennis that's really great advice thank you I had no idea drugs huh all right wash that down now I was getting that aftertaste going whoo all right Oh No hey whoa yes I am going to be eating the whole bar Afro Samurai where I'm going to try to uh while we're waiting for the edible to kick in let's do a little uh dab I've got a nice new portable dabber here the puff co+ they did not pay me I bought this with my own money they didn't send me this um and I just thought I would do a couple quick dabbers while we're waiting for the edible to take effect thank you thank you gee money I've uh I've worked the system will say you know I put in my hours I've put in my hours on the the portable DAP I might I might do a video on at some point I actually wanted to break into I'll get into a little bit this later um I really wanted to do some reviews of some hardware for weed stuff for example I've got a volcano I would like to UM I've got this puff coke plus I've got some other cool gear that I'd like to review so I might do that in the future so here's my puff co+ it's a little oily on the inside and unfortunately right now take my uh where's this crumble crumble my crumble here uh oh gee diesel I believe and just load it up that's actually not the way you're supposed to load it you're supposed to load it with this little dart thing right here it's got a little dart you love rub it in your oils right there ceramic tank all that fun stuff light it up it's really cool I like this for two reasons um it's got a three different temperature settings so you can vape it on any different temperatures um or any three different temperatures for different you know taste variations or whatnot it also has a session mode where you can tap this little button twice we'll do that here and that oh gotta turn it on first and like all these you turn on you hit it five times blah blah blah blah blah um so uh yes crumble is just by the way fear the beard it's just a different kind of wax it's there shatter crumble there's some other kinds it's just a different way of distilling it um so yeah Bradish and buttery um so here we go we're gonna put this incest remote so you just tap this little thing twice here and what this does is basically it keeps glowing and lets you know it's heating up it basically doesn't like a whole dab it basically heats up that entire chamber or close to it and gives it to you in one big puff so you don't just sit there and keep going on over and over again really like that sesh mode so here we go it's about to be done now we'll just do the whole thing and I'm a copper alright um so a tweet tastic says they remember doing ketamine in school was great tweak what were you doing ketamine in school for um were you just doing it recreationally were you a vet did you have your hands and some actual horse tranquilizers who knows but I have been down that K hole now and I I do recommend it it's it's an interesting experience um oh I guess I should get into this a little bit since my last livestream I have also done LSD one time no twice excuse me um and it doesn't I enjoyed it I enjoyed it immensely I did not get any sort of hallucinations I never got to that point um I'm not sure if I am entirely affected by hallucinogens and ways that most people are but it still gave me a sort of an opening of the mind just sort of all the trippy hallucinogens stuff never sort of came about uh what dosage asked Jack Daniels I did that's a great question I did three tabs I believe I don't actually know what the dosage was um yes so I I'm not sure it was supposed to be a very high dose I did a high dose the first time Anna high dose the second time again still really enjoyed the experience everybody else around me was having visuals and and and sort of more trippy standard trippy experiences that wasn't me but I still really enjoyed the sort of opening of the mind the LSD presented it's very different than ketamine um as different as read as to alcohol Ken Amin is to LSD they're very very different experiences so Ethan asked do I do T thinks the edibles kick in faster since it's a thousand compared to one hundred probably not I find the effects come on uh more when the effects do hit they have obviously hit more intensely of course I don't want fun they never like come on any quicker I still find this sort of that same about forty five minutes and then it really starts to uh uh well I'm gonna have to find some good stuff alright guys well I'm gonna take another bite of this blackout brownie here or what probably bout a third of the way through the house Oh yuck Thank You Ben wash it down with Oh Thank You sport nom nom nom I'm through and through Oh grips real gross it's actually a little nastier now than my first more I eat it the grosser that sort of taste ooh so bitter yeah those first bites work Oh almost ah whoo when you eat some minutes a thousand milligrams you're gonna pay for it you're not gonna enjoy it you're not gonna enjoy anything that has a thousand milligrams of THC in it that's just a lesson for life for anybody and I've dropped my dab tool on my carpet now which is really unfortunate if you do eat um if you do eat a and edible that claims to have a thousand milligrams in it and you do enjoy it you are not eating in that bowl that has a thousand milligrams of THC in it just to let you know um Nicolas asked do I watch ice Poseidon um I don't I don't even know what ice beside is Nicolas highest I ever got on edibles ask Jack Daniels good question uh the first time I did fire crackers was actually the highest I've ever been on edibles I made firecrackers with my partner had no idea what I was dosing just I had a big a capsule like a an old weed capsule like they put Whedon and I used that to store my a BB and I didn't measure it out I just like oh I just poured a bunch of it on some Nutella and graham crackers threw that in the oven cooked it up ate the nasty nasty firecracker then was like oh I'll go grab some dinner so I went out to go pick up some food while my partner stayed home and by the time I hit the checkout counter like this is not a good scene I am higher than I have ever been in my life I don't know how I'm gonna get back to my house I don't know how I'm gonna pay for this I I don't even know how I'm gonna order um somehow I managed to you know actually go up to the person and say the thing and count out the correct amount of cash to give them nothing I really remember it I just remember well I remember arriving at home I don't actually remember walking home I just remember arriving at home my partner already passed out and I just remember sitting on the couch going this is bad this is bad this is bad this is bad and leaving the food there on the coffee table and then waking up about 12 hours later and realizing I just wasted a lot of money and food that I didn't get to eat but was still fun so doing firecrackers for the first time whoo and Enrique asks how many times have you done 1,000 milligrams in one go this would be my fourth time I believe III do it all the time on live streaming um so it's just me mark says is this a tried and trusted product no tis not I have not done one of the enjoyable edibles thousand milligrams before so we're also gonna find out if they're worth their weight or not and a meal says in difference between milligrams and grams and fear the beard says answers that question for me um holy [ __ ] tweet tastic says I remember my first animal was at school and that was 750 milligrams your first animal uh tweak was 750 milligrams holy jesus now that that is crazy um and then Jack Daniels asks and I'm married I've been married for about five for over five years now yes I'm married um in sport ass if I've ever done salvia I have never done salvia um I know people who have done salvia I've never had anybody ever described it to me as a fun experience everybody who's ever done it has been Mike that [ __ ] was intense dude like that [ __ ] was nuts they in not in a positive way just like you know I may be I'm glad I did it but I don't want to do it again so that has kind of influenced my my decisions there who wait you're eating a brownie and vaping some wax oh yes I should g-money but maybe not you know I have this incredibly ridiculously high tolerance and Aaron says I do here do you love you of course we love you Aaron Jack Daniel says any new carts I have tried I have tried some new carts recently um nothing that has blown my doors off no nothing nothing that is really knocked me out of my work I haven't tried to review any big brand-name cartridges recently or tried any of those because I'm saving this for reviews so I've tried some smaller ones from some ones from smaller dispensaries or smaller producers and I've been you know had mixed feelings about them some the first reviews that one will do when week season 3 which is what we're calling what comes next week season 3 we're gonna do the back the PAX era the PAX pods likes TV pax has their own and I love pax hey welcome Michael so glad you are here so glad you are here thank you and Aaron says he has met the rock Dwayne the rock Johnson will congratulations man oh I might have to do that Jack Daniels thank you yes and fear the pods are pricey they are pricier than the cartridges for now you generally pay about between 1/3 and 50% more for them I find them leak a lot less I find them to be generally tastier I find them to be like something like this easy to be a lot more discreet in terms of like hiding it um but and I do think those prices are gonna come down as the pods become you know sort of more mainstream I'm guessing we're going to see a lot more in the pond space other than just easy impacts because it seems to be those seem to be doing really well so I bet we'll see some copycats in the near future ah so nameless wants to know on a scale of one to ten how high am i right now nameless I would say I am only at about a three at the moment but it is rising well take another brownie of that bite of that brownie in just a second what do you look like without a beard says Erin Reed uh I look like I do now just not as hairy um Jeff Daniel says oh talking to tweek hey Nick hey so good to see you back man no I was a youtube casualty but ended up uh fight my way back tooth and nail or they just let me back and then they ended up letting everybody back what a weird time for everybody oh of course mark of course I'm gonna be watching the stream I'm super excited about the wedding I'm getting really really excited about seeing it it's gonna be a fun fun time I bet you are getting excited my man you're gonna be married in a week oh my god yes we will we will we will definitely be there and um Jack Daniel says am I gonna try we tube I might start putting stuff on we tube I don't know uh I'll see how the platform sort of kind of shakes out I'm kind of lazy so I haven't really put as much effort into as I want or need but I would like to at some point um and then uh and stick boy wants to know it's welcome sick boy we're glad you're here by the way man wondering if CBD edibles would be better than a CBD cream for back pain and unfortunately sick boy I am NOT a CBD expert um I I don't proclaim to be I don't do see be dedicated CBD things very often um it's not what I'm looking for as much from th from not THC obviously cuz CBD into each do things but it's not what I'm looking for so much from marijuana I'm definitely more interested in the THC than the CBD but I will put some feelers out there and let you know if I get a good answer from some I see BD Bros all right man and uh if I ever read mendacious mold bug uh I don't think so Michael why do you ask why do you ask uh Jack Daniels ass uh have I not been uploading because of laziness or something else um no not laziness uh I've been well we've been doing some brainstorming here at wheats HQ we're gonna be reviews are still coming reviews are still gonna be the same as always still gonna be really Anibal still reviewing cartridges but we're thinking about new things for season three as we're calling it for wheats um so we'll see Oh malicious it's not mendacious oh nameless says I gotta take another bite I'm gonna do it for you nameless here we go oh and Steve Scott I will be telling you about VR in just a second another bite time this one's for you nameless whoa okay they are great Steve Scott I really like my uh man that is so bad it really is worse than with everybody who get that [ __ ] damn so Steve is Steve's Steve Scott says he's got this name shiner pen awesome and then he says you've been looking into a VR headset still loving mine still loving mine I've got three that was wort I've got three VR headsets I've got the oculus rift which is right behind me I've got a HTC vive and somewhere the newest one to the collection the oculus go I haven't really messed with the go very much to be honest okay I need to catch up with uh with the chat marx's do I have any future plans to turn to twitch absolutely mark we will be back to twitch we absolutely will just got to get some weird things figured out between the meantime hey Thank You Freddy welcome and uh Oren says how am I feeling I'm feeling about back to the four level and rising rising rising uhm musu three away now Lu su what do we know what is it that we know yes everything is exciting and um Steve I would recommend if you are thinking about getting into the VR space go with the oculus the vibe has better tech for sure of the vive ISM the vibe is a you know the tracking is a shit-ton better on the vibe but the office has more excluse they seem to be more our Facebook seems to be more invested in VR than Valve's us at this point unfortunately and it just seems to me the the money and VR is still coming from the oculus space and and and things seem to be I don't know not doing so great on the HTC end so if you're gonna get a br headset i'd say go with the rift even though the tech on the vine is definitely better now the tech being the tracking the the stuff behind eyes is the pretty much the same and Jack Dino says the animal is tasting worse I don't know if it's actually tasting worse Jack Daniels I'm just being a big old [ __ ] it's just tasting gross and I don't like the taste and a little more I eat a bit the more like yes um wait I'm an animal uh pre user says musu I'm not an animal abuser I love animals I'm gonna have a lever oh yeah yeah

Lois that documentary about the the chimp raised in there was about a couple years ago really good yeah chimps scary man but maybe we didn't Mel his mouth what do I know uh Joseph well the reviews are

name Adam Lanza called in about that that's crazy I had no idea and then it's just me mark says if you could smoke with one celeb alive or dead who would it be and why uh I guess a celebrity um yeah I guess they would be a celebrity I think I would want to get high with the physics professor a Richard Feynman brilliant guy brilliant science communicator a brilliant physicist I mean top of his games in both in terms of academic ability and communicative ability he would be an amazing person just sit down with and smokes and balls and just listen to him talk for two hours I listen to Richard Fineman talk about anything and have him be a little loosey-goosey would just be the icing on the cake pour one out for my good boy my old man where's your fine men love to meet you up in heaven that doesn't exist and smoke with the up there boy but if there is a heaven you're going there I mean if there's a hell you're going there because I'm certain you're an atheist right you had to be um uh

definitely heading and michael says michael marcus aurelius as an answer which is the even better answer marcus aurelius one of history's greatest men for sure one of the greatest thinkers throughout history incredible answer jealous of that one um uh and Chad I would I would also like to do that yes in the future I would like to do some comparative videos for sure and sport would like to know what gets me to attend very little very few things these days really the lat the last time I was that a solid ten was probably sometime in 2017 I don't think I've hit at ten and 2018 but usually edibles are the only way that I can get there um attend doesn't get you to high expense explain what a ten feels like to us I guess that's a really good point jack daniel\u00b4s that is a very very very good point um and let me get to that in just a second but I want to move down the chat for a second and Jack I'm gonna get back to you because you're right about the 10 thing being too high I I guess the scale is variable for everyone um and uh Fernando wants to know if I am fated right now I am getting faded Fernando we are about two thirds of the way through the brownie I'm about to go and take this third NER next fight let's go and do that it's gonna taste really gross not looking forward to it Oh ooh whoo and Wayne Wayne you have a question I would like to get to mr. Cook whoo-hoo so bad alright Wayne cook asks Oh first off Derrick welcome Derek we're glad you're here buddy thanks for joining it and then Derrick Wayne does ask have you ever thought about having guests on your videos yes Wayne all the time um wheats would love to have some guests we would love to have some other kind of content if you feel anybody out there in chat land or watching this video later or watching this you know whatever the case may be if you want to share this with somebody else out there that you think is really you know likes to talk about weed and haptics they have some interesting things to say because they certainly can't be any less interesting about weed than I am if you know anybody or if you are that person hit me up send me an email I'd love to talk to you we can uh we can try to work something out see if we can expand the wheats brand or whatever the case may be so if you know anybody who is interested let me know um and we do have things planned for other people coming in and we do actually have some long-lost interviews in the wheats vaults that may have to stay in the wheats vaults for legal reasons now but we'll get there eventually uh and Mark says I hope he gets to an 11 I do too man I do too I jack daniel says one gram Kentico is amazing I wish I could find one and Wow Wow ten to you was uh was was 1/5 of a can of coke piece um attend to me should I've only ever been uncomfortably high once and that was that time with firecrackers outside of maybe the very first time I smoked weed you know and it just being weird I don't think I've ever had a truly unpleasant experience so I don't outside of the doing firecrackers for the first time every other time I've been atmospherically hi excuse me um every time I've been just you know above the clouds hi it's still been totally enjoyable for me so um attend to me should feel like almost almost of course nothing like ego death or anything of that nature but it you should feel somewhat disconnected from reality I think attend should feel like that you you should feel some kind of break with with your mind-body connection you you should be living in a your your mind should be in a different space I guess um and that doesn't happen to be very often but I really enjoy it every time it does I like getting to that headspace I really like getting to that headspace I find some of my most interesting thinking a lot cons when I get to that headspace um I just very really happen to get to that level even with these thousand milligram animals okay so um so Jeff courses makes you want to buy some thousand milligram enjoyable right now I would say at this point after being 45 minutes in and being already as high as I am the enjoyable animals thousand milligrams are pretty good I'm not sure they're it's gonna be I don't think it's gonna be as good as a crow but thousand we'll find out but I'm already pretty high um I'm now past the five level and I'm getting up to the sixth territory and really I'm only eating about you know I only had about a third of that brownie right at the start so about 45 minutes in I'm already feeling pretty good so I'm I'm kind of kind of excited about this um try a one grab damn bro I couldn't do a one grab one grab one gram dab sorry Jack Daniels I just I'm too much of a copper I don't have the lung capacity for that [ __ ] like doing dabs for me I mean doing any kind of combustible like it's just not ever gonna get me to where I want because I just don't like a Mac offer I don't have lung capacity I don't know um and I don't know why I don't have the lung capacity I can actually my breath for a decent a period of time but just weak weak lungs um and then uh uh Jeff grass if I'm in SoCal yes sir Southern California I live proudly in Long Beach love my city um yes and Michael says I think the problem is weed is not inherently interesting your thoughts in politics religion philosophy while on weed is what is interesting and that is very true we didn't have itself does not make interesting thoughts it just Spurs you to it just what would be a good way of describing it um it sort of enables connections that were not previously possible opens pathways neurological pathways to you know two different connections in your brain so you can make some kind of all kinds of big leaps and connections that you were never able to make with without the substance always I find that to be the case um and I've I ever tried combining edibles with Creighton no I have not largely because Creighton upsets my stomach I get a little nauseous on kratom always but then again maybe that was wouldn't be perfect for that because it should also help with the naja but never mix it I might still I have a [ __ ] ton of kratom left I wish it them I haven't had done it in like six months but I have a ton of it um and Steve Scott said he had a 200 milligram weed Frazee yesterday ooh a 200 milligram what is a weed like a like a popsicle that sounds good um I've never had a frozen edible yes like you're blasting off in a rocket oh that's awesome Wayne that's so cool that you go all out to a Colorado that's really cool hey Timmy welcome and I take that as a compliment being called Jesus a lot of people like that guy seems to have you know a lot of followers still a billion people like him so thank you and thank you Richard I really appreciate that okay that highest dab bud dosage you've ever tried I mean Jack Daniels I have definitely I would say the biggest dab I've ever done in one go is probably a fifth of a gram I probably I've done a fifth of a gram in a go before and that gets that doesn't actually get me that high I mean really doesn't you know it gives me a high for a little bit but it fades very quickly and doesn't ever get me to that level is that edibles - it was written they [ __ ] with your tolerance man they definitely [ __ ] you up with your tolerance uh and I appreciate the kind words there Richard as you said and I already said um ever visit anywhere else in the USA Jack Daniels I visited pretty much everywhere in the United States I think I've been to every state other than Maine and Alaska Hawaii never been I've been to every continuous state other than me um and calamus wants to know uh I am in the hood I don't think Long Beach is the hood uh I mean it used to be I don't think it is anymore I love where I live I'm very proud of proud of my city I love love Long Beach um but I don't I don't know if I would classify it as quote-unquote hood um and I'm glad to see you live in Bellflower man well fires a cool place Sergio of course dude we'll have to do a elites Meetup well we'll get all the SoCal crew up and we'll because pretty soon Long Beach is going to get uh places where you can smoke indoors like uh like coffee shop type things I believe that is the case I believe that is the case Oh Hidden Hills La Jackie D well that's not too far at all and barely functional wants to know how barely functional I am right now and the scale is I would say meant about a six and still rising rising rising um and Jack Daniels have I ever visited downtown LA I'm in downtown LA all the time most recently I was there last Saturday to go see a robbery at a band I love and I'll be there again in a couple weeks to go see another band of some kind always in downtown LA love it um and uh and and if I lived anywhere else in the u.s. well I lived in East Tennessee for about 25 years of my life and have lived in Southern California for only about three so uh only really lived in new places I just had family that loved to travel it looks in the United States growing up so I've been everywhere um a from New Jersey welcome Artie so glad you're here and Mark wants to know what's my personal preference bong blunt dad etc um if it's not edibles mark my favorite way is without a doubt and I think you can see it there in the background is my trusty beloved somewhere move my chair volcano there it is I'm doing this backwards yes I love to vape we using my volcano loved my volcano it isn't without is that my favorite way to do combustibles Bar None um behind that would probably be just a standard old water pipe your old fashioned bong and then dams probably behind that um where some fire shops in LA for the low uh I don't know a very good ones in La La's Jesus uh the the wind world in California is in a weird weird weird place right now guys um it's just in a weird place after July all the new regulations went into effect and it is bizarre to see all these dispensaries struggling trying to go legit but uh you know it's very difficult to go legit they make it very extremely difficult to go legit uh and there are still a shit-ton maybe the legit maybe the bulk I don't know I literally don't know but maybe the bulk of purchases are still black market especially here in Long Beach if you go to weed Maps go whoops go to weed Maps look in Long Beach and just look at deliveries almost all of those delivery services are black market I would say I don't know of any are that are legal you can just tell by what products they offer if they're offering edibles that are over a hundred milligrams they are not operating legally and most of the delivery dispensaries here in Long Beach are offering they're still offering you know some cushy punches and some you know things from that are you know before or even these like these enjoyable edibles this is a thing that was produced after the cutoff and they just don't give a [ __ ] they're just gonna keep making black market products which I love them for God bless him for it I hope more people can say [ __ ] this stupid regulation we're just gonna keep making the same way we've always meant but it's not just edibles the actual flower now has like a track and trace system so like every ounce of weed or every gram of weed is like track and trace throughout the state it's really ridiculous and people are just sort of figuring it out as they go and I'm guessing two years from now California's gonna look very different in terms of the weed market cuz I assume a lot of this [ __ ] that's going on right now it's not gonna continue flying because it's just too expensive it's just gonna keep the black market up and running and that is not good for California so I assume there's gonna be some push and pull over the next couple of years and we're gonna see some drastic swings in these regulations but that's just me um and let's go back here to the chat and black Mariner wants to know why the hell I've been great question I have been away coming up with ideas busy with work stuff but we are back we're gonna be low end on the content spout for a while we're gonna be doing plenty of live streams and stuff but terms a lot of the content reviews will be a little bit sparse for the next month until we get our content bulk back up to the launch of wheat season three in October fingers crossed um okay countless pounds welcome uh so um countless sorry I have consumed about 4/5 of the brownie I have just this lateral corner left I am out to about a six and a half in terms of Highness and rising rising rising getting pretty high living pretty good uh Jeff Gordon wants to know if I eat the brownies on an empty or full stomach always on an mostly empty stomach I find a bolus to be on a full stomach to be not as potent so I try to eat on a you know not totally empty stomach but but at least I haven't eaten a big meal recently um so uh how was it growing up in East Tennessee check dales it sucks eastern sea's a terrible place nobody should ever live there um oh and sports is hardly a here of people moving to Cali everyone's to leave I elected to move here I wanted to move to California I wanted to be in this state it was it was a choice I wanted to be out of backwards-ass Tennessee and is a Knoxville is not a bad city where I come from they're good people there are some interesting things happening but really the state is just full of monstrous horrible backwards-ass people and I could not be happier to be gone love California though oh I've never tried jungle boys I have tried can weed though Jackie knows I have tried nitrogen sealed canned wheat that was pretty good um so let me get back to up the chat Michael says eat is [ __ ] okay well he won't good thank you for saying that so I'm welcome from San Diego yes and the taxes are too high in California they are ridiculously too high in the the prices for weed for legal read weed right now in California are almost laughable they're gonna have to get this should figure out unless they just want the black market to continue to thrive um Oh mark wants me to do the less the brownie and one go let's do it let's do it um have Care Bear pieces on them no I have not been car not I have not heard of the Care Bear gonna be brown or gummies I would be wary of them gummies are usually not the best but if you've heard good things may be worth a try um okay so let us before I finish this mark I'm gonna do this for you and real quick Wayne cook to answer your question I have found a legitimately great gummy it's called a flourish flourish out here in California hopefully they'll be in Colorado soon so you can try them on your next trip Wayne but flourish is a legitimately great great gummy and I'll get back into the into the we talked but for mark mark this one's for you this one's for you and candy for your upcoming nuptials one bite do it all one bite here we go Johnny mr. Hatter Smith what's new do I pick my nose yes of course and peace from the jellybean cough drop senator the world whoa cool here we go three two one don't match I'm so bad oh [ __ ] come come for me girl come girl for me I'm almost no no no Jesus Christ huh okay mega64 welcome buddy welcome welcome welcome oh [ __ ] okay oh nice wait I'm glad to see that all right so I need to get back to UM I need to get back to this chat I'm Way behind on the chat does my husband / wife don't know if you're gay or straight um I'll leave that a mystery but my partner my spouse my beloved spouse does not do does not do a any kind of marijuana but they very supportive up um I'm still really curious why Johnny mr. Hatter's me wants to know if I pick my nose but the answer is yes indeed abou says they don't pick their nose you know what they are a liar duh uh that tasted awful by the way so bad so bad and Austin welcome to the chat what did you miss you just missed me eat the last bite of that [ __ ] awful brownie so bad whoo ah and Jeff wants to know why do all these tennis animals taste like [ __ ] not all animals taste like [ __ ] all thousand milligram animals definitely taste like [ __ ] though ah didn't have to you just can't pack that much Oh Minh keep burping it up whoo I am really curious why musu keeps calling me an animal abuser that makes me feel sad I love animals um all right so where are we Richard wants to know on a scale of one to ten rate orchid essentials on how good it is compared to other babes and how you can taste the actual taste of the weed that came from it orchid is incredible um orchid is my favorite probably my favorite actual cartridge I think I like the pod system better it is as good in terms of like terpene flavor profile as any cartridges I've ever had I mean truly flawless and about the most potent cartridges out there you see him grab them cannot speak for orchid highly enough um and okay let's see ah awesome wants to know how long it'll take for that brandy kick in Austin it's already kicking in because I already ate most of it before that point I'm up to about a seven now um and then Willy Wonka says usually the terrible tasting ones gets you pretty a high yes that is the good part Willy Wonka is that there's pain you get games from your pain right is that the phrase no pain no gain to my camera matter what the [ __ ] yes if it tastes like [ __ ] it usually is a good sign that you're gonna get pretty placed uh I want to uh thank you mark thank you mark by the way um and I want to uh just um hit up a boy mega64 real quick and say mega64 you're gonna have to come back out to Southern California at some point soon because we're launching a new venture well let's go and talk about this right now and I'm sweating look at this guy's I've got like a legit sweat stain Jesus I'm sweating because I can't turn on my AC cuz I don't want to make this noise sweating on mega64 Southern California let me talk about my new venture by the way um so uh this is part of the thing I've been why I've been gone I've been working on something new not a new video thing it is a new social thing for out here in Southern California I'm starting a new I'm gonna be starting a meet-up group here in SoCal more for the Long Beach area I have uh I'm resetting up very soon we've done some test runs and everything looks good too uh pico projectors two screens two switches and a big-ass battery generator and the goal is night Beach switch the meetup is I get people together we meet up on the beach at night time I bring two projectors and we play local multiplayer games on the beach at night I'm here in Long Beach really looking forward to it using some really cool tech check out nap nebula UNK and hunker so you saying uncle nebula projectors they're amazing love them so we're getting ready we've put in place a Mario Kart you know all the good stuff but really we're waiting for Smash Brothers and then we're gonna be doing Smash Brothers tournaments and stuff on the beach come December so we're looking forward to that oh boy I am way behind on chat Michael wants to think it says do you think consuming massive amounts of marijuana made me gay no I think what made me gay was the freaking frogs right the freaking frogs turned me gay if if my boy Alex Jones is correct well love uh yes a bread and butter you said he was good on your first bite that is the crazy thing it got WAY worse as time went along it got way way WAY worse and now I can just taste and now I just have that awful aftertaste in my mouth whoo Austin asked what's the best thing to do in your experience when you're uncomfortably super high and I have the perfect answer for this it is to see a 4d X movie what is the 40 X movie you say a 40 X movie is uh you say for example Mission Impossible the most recent mission impossible it's like Mission Impossible but as if it were an amusement park ride you your seats move they vibrate water shoots at you there's lightning there's smoke and fog it's awesome if you're too high it is so scary but it is one of the best experiences you ever have because you I've done it too high many times and loved it every time do it do it do it um and uh let's see uh where am i where am i on this chat okay I might be uh I might be caught up here have I tried to pax era pods Willy Wonka not yet they are going to be one of the first reviews we are going to be doing coming back here on and wheat season three so look for that in October I'm very excited I love packs as a dry herbal vape I have both the packs one in two and love them a lot like a whole lot so I'm really looking forward to the pods because I think Stevie's great and I think pax makes great products so um I am very excited uh and then also wants to know if we can do a one to ten comparison on steezy and like mini-review comparison to other cartridges we can do something like that in the future for sure uh and shadow bear wants to know why he is not getting high anymore shadow bear my best piece of advice and something that will certainly help take a tolerance break 72 hours can be enough for a decent reset but if you take like a two-week tolerance break its shadow bear you are going it's going to be like you're smoking for the first time all over again I'll just take a couple weeks off come back to it and you will start to feel high again I promise um all right so where we at do you think the desire to alter mental states often is reflection on your personal reflections save quality real life if so should this be addressed um perhaps I so do I think my desire to get high all the time is it does it reflect on my mental health is that the question um uh perhaps uh I maybe I don't know that's a great question uh I mean it's usually not healthy to be high as often as I am that is you know not usually a sign of a of a healthy lifestyle but I feel like I'm living a pretty good life but maybe not all right uh Peyton says just got here what did you miss uh you missed me eat the whole brownie but you have not missed me getting increasingly high because I am at a 7.5 now maybe and going up oh my god okay alright where we got we're good alright okay so I think I am now at where the part in the chat where I told you guys that I'm making some cool outside video game stuff I do know how to do that Ben I just haven't done it um nice nice alright uh and then somebody says why are people so worried about your private life not sure good question Wayne and Jeff wants to know if I PC games Jeff I play mostly only PC games well that's not true I played actually a [ __ ] kind of switch and I have a ps4 and Xbox one but I PC is where I do my most of my gaming you can find me on Steam at who barded WH o BR te d WH o BR te D right who vard it check me out I mean um later me I'll take care thanks for stopping by uh and then uh Jack dances what's my sexual orientation I am straight I'm straight I am straight not Amina if I was gay I would have loved to have been gay was that a weird that's a weird thing to say yeah I would've been happy to have been born gay I just happened to be straight uh and uh we did Jack wants to know does weed affect my professional life at all just curious there's no professional looking uh I would say not at all it does not affect my professional life in the slightest well I can't say that for absolute certainty because I haven't not been doing weed long enough in my professional life to compare but I know that sometimes doing some weed can actually inspire some things in my professional life so you know you take some you loosen um oh well thank you for saying that Michael uh Richard um I don't know I've only done a couple of the different varieties of the orchid I've been the Jack Herer and what indica did I do I can't remember I did I've only tried them twice um once for review and then once just for personal enjoyment and I enjoyed the flavors immensely both times but I can't remember what the indica variety was but I know the Jack Herer was excellent one of the best tasting Jack's I've ever had um nice way that's so cool I'm glad man that's really oh that's so nice to see oh and Steve says I've been trapped in Skyrim on switch force which seems like way too long but I'm loving it Steve I am the same way I actually got trapped to the unsired Skyrim on the switch I put about 25 hours into it and was loving replaying on the switch I had a blast that was until I got a psvr and then put about a hundred hours into Skyrim VR so I I literally played on the switch and then got it for PlayStation VR and then it was like Oh goodbye switch version and then played the same game again for another hundred hours in a row after playing you know a hundred hours of it back in 2011 but I would recommend playing in VR I've not played on PC VR I've only played it on the shitty psvr and it was still amazing it was incredible actually I was really impressed with Skyrim they are actually really really genuinely impressed more so than I expected to be I actually found it more playable than Fallout VR when Fallout first came out um I have not played Skyrim on PC VR since it has come out even though I would like to I just might need a little bit of a break from it I put a lot hours in um wait what uh Michael says born gay is not a real position uh I'll dress that in a moment um and Austin wants to know favorite steezy cartridge uh for sativa it's always gonna be the jack for indica uh boy um I don't really have a favorite I actually couldn't tell you my favorite I tried a bunch of them I like them all I just know when I go to sativa I like Jack Herer the most in inika strains I don't really have indica I I'm really not even that much of an indica sativa differentiate I I'm not as nuanced on that as as many are and when it comes to different strains between indica and sativa I'm really really fuzzy that's why I like in bowls so they all sort of come out even in the wash I guess um okay uh and in the meantime I want to give another quick shout out my boy mega64 and chat and say mega64 have you played slay the spire yet my god uh also anybody in chat if you are looking for a PC game that will what nourish your soul that will that will redefine your life place ladies spire man that is the most play time I have ever had on a video game um a card game of all things uh I have between My partner and I we have like 270 hours of slay this fire a sixteen dollar steam game it's unreal I love it slay this fire check it out um check it out check it out for sure and Jack Dino says I yes I don't do crazy amounts of weed when I'm going to do work like I would never do this and then sit down to write something no that would not work I can uh uh you know I can take a bowl with me and smoke it you know smoke some balls while I'm working totally fine but I would never never never ventured to try something like this and try to do some serious work um uh and barely puncture says you handle being hide better than I I get slow and forget everything I am forgetting plenty barely functional so don't don't give me too much credit just yet I'm definitely forgetting plenty and I'm losing track of my thoughts uh but I can pretty confidently say I can pretty confidently say I am one of the best operators in the world I just I'm being crazy hi like um I I would love to be in a competition I would love somebody set this up for me out there in an in comments land or in chaplain whoever's watching this video um uh if anybody out there I don't know what my limit is I literally have no idea at this point what my upper stratosphere is I I don't have a clue um uh if there's somebody out there who has a similar tolerance I don't I don't know of anybody who has that tolerance like me uh I mean to be entirely free uh I seem to be alone on in this level of this stratosphere of tolerance and weeds is partially responsible for that but uh it would be immensely satisfying to me to do some kind of like a competition like a day-long edible competition and then have some kind of to prove your to prove your worth in addition just being able to consume it you have to function still so you would do you would set up some kind of you know man I am struggling to get this word out I cannot think of the word you you have some like educational tests that's not the right word I'm coming trying to come up with you didn't make some metrics at the start you would you would basically have people do two similar academic tests or whatever and and then after doing a thousand milligrams compare their tests after doing two thousand milligrams having to take a test again compare those tests and just have somebody go on and on I'd love to have that set up I think it'll be a blast I just don't know anybody else who uh who's doing a thousand milligrams in a single pop so I don't know if you know something let me know uh inject Daniel says uh let me get back to chat here guys whoo I am way behind on chat way behind um yeah the duh steve says nice country could be our plunge you do am I still doing ketamine treatments I am finished with my ketamine treatments it was a series of six so I've done all six of them um [Applause] weeks once a shadow bearer wants to know uh is it possible for other brands to copy other brands like the package and card but just not the potency shadow bear it's absolutely possible in California reason being is most of these are black market products and they are not copy written they are not protected in any way shape or form there is no logo protection for enjoyable enjoyable edibles they have no copyright protection because this is a black market product if I want you tomorrow I can make this exact same packaging exact same everything and make the product and they couldn't do [ __ ] about it I mean that's just you know that's part of being in the black market so absolutely there are there counterfeit products out there for sure I know in brass knuckles cartridges a lot of unscrupulous dispensary owners will will fill that [ __ ] up with you know their homemade wax or whatever and resell the pens for you know and I exorbitant markup um so you do actually have to watch for out watch out for counterfeiting I don't know that ever happened in the edible world I don't know if anybody ever like copied kirova or kiva or anything like that um I don't not to my knowledge I don't think it happened but I know it happens with cartridges and other things too you know there's all kinds of just like selling up of you know one strain being another and charging more for it in yada yada yada so uh do Jack Daniels what's know if I smell granddaddy purp versus haze you feel the same that's actually pretty true for me um I I do notice some difference I believe between indica and sativa although it is not very different for me um not remarkably pronounced the difference but between strain to strain I I I really struggled telling telling much of a difference uh uh ah I just yeah um I'm the same way with III don't find any nuances and in like alcohol or anything else like it's just all kind of the same to me I mean not that alcohol and weed are the same but when drinking different spirits and things don't affect me differently um mega64 says still not yet it still has not played to slay the spire mega64 it is coming to switch at some point so you have that to look forward to uh and what are my top three cartridge brands and pod says Austin number one is Steve Z number two is orchid and number three is heavy hitters so in that order and once TZ number two orchid number three heavy hitters I think heavy hairs are better than the thing that they were created to rip off brass knuckles III think heavy theirs are much better than brass knuckles that's just me um and uh oh and uh Willy Wonka gives a recommendation for packs era pod which I will be trying that one thank you and let's see where we act and Michael says here is your competition to prove your highness talk about something that is not pot or video game related and I like that challenge let me get through the chat here and then I will go through it uh okay what if you what if you eight to 1000 milligrams brownies simultaneously at the same time Austin I would get very high but I don't think I would get I wouldn't I don't I don't think I have intended me to get to like the panic attack level I think I would just go to sleep like one I'm just accustomed to it like hey there's I know what being too high is and I know you can just go to sleep so yeah I don't I I don't think 2000 milligram brownies would make me really that crazy I don't know I don't know I've never tried pushing it to that limit before for one reason this it's just [ __ ] expensive like the two of these brownies would cost 80 bucks and like I don't want to spend any bucks just to realize that oh my god it's gonna make me feel like [ __ ] but maybe for a future video um Jeff says his tolerance is pretty high and wheats us he says want to dive into a game tonight maybe Stephen will see where I'm at after this livestream and see if I'm still a cogent enough to play some games okay uh yes I would love to put out there that okay so Jeff core says he pops thousands so Jeff cores up there Jeff thank you I'm just glad to know out there and the only way to hit them hard was the Karoo of a black bar yes the kirova black bar is in utter monster a monster a legend a total legend and deserves it's legend it really sucked enough they've repurposed that name for they're just like hundred milligram edibles they should have saved that that that name the black barb um so uh what's he wearing my ad do a white stasis nose wants to know where I've been I have just been busy sorry sorry sorry but a lot of things going on in life but we are going to be back uh the content drip will still be a little slow coming of the next little bit until we get to a October win we are going to be launching wheat season three proper um yeah yeah I I hear you Jeff it's really sad it's so sad the black bars are gonna be gone but I this is not a black bar uh an hour and 20 minutes in this is if you this will get you super high still I am on my way to getting super high from this and I'm feeling pretty happy about that you guys I might have turned the AC on just because I'm sweating so much and I'm sorry about the noise I'm really sorry about this I'm so sorry um okay uh and Rove is good stuff shadow bear I really like Rove Rauf makes really quality affordable cartridges they are not nearly as expensive as you know your brass knuckles or your heavy hitters or your orchids but they're still really good really good tasting and pretty potent um uh Jack Daniels that it's Oh Thank You nitrous placer thank you thank you see a shadow bear thanks so much for joining in and uh and thank you for me that Congrats there nitrous placer and Jack didn't was sent you a question about eating that many cookies it's terrible it's ridiculous that that's the weird way we have to go um I assume many cookies are not going to exist for very long or they'll become the trend of many cookies it's gonna go away because right now that is but everybody in the edible space is doing is they're just going many cookies routes uh it's not the edible customers are in this you know edible customers and I promise whoever said just stop talking about weed and video games I will be talking about something else after this but let me get this rant off my chest for a second uh there are only really two two types of edible customers first timers you know somebody would coming to the state who's like oh I would love it I'm gonna try and everyone get [ __ ] up and people who have a very high tolerance the exact opposite ends of the scale right those are the two people in edibles people who like never done weed before and don't want to like smoke and want to get [ __ ] up and people who have a very high tolerance and want an easy way to get medicated that doesn't require you know burning out your lungs or whatever the case may be and the edibles market now literally only serves that one end of that market which is the first timers but the much much much much more lucrative end of that market is the people with the high tolerances they're the ones who are buying the majority of those animals they're they're doing buying the overwhelming majority of especially the potent edible products out there are people with super high tolerances and now they have really nowhere else to turn and that market is gonna start to dry up really fast as I said at the very beginning Korova is now out there doing flour they're making flour my guess is because of lost revenue or what projected lost revenue for edibles like I haven't bought any Korova products since I stopped reviewing them back and around April when I you know had reviewed most of their first wave of products new products coming out because I I don't want to eat ten little mini cookies to get a little bit high that's insane and it's like twenty bucks um and I think the animals market uh the legal animal oops market is getting a shrink it's gonna contract quite a bit and we're gonna be left with just a few players fighting for you know one mini cookie model and one gummy model or something and it's it's gonna be a sad hellscape and a little bit unless those regulations start to change um all right man so where we at have I ever tried the ketamine no spray no add the ketamine I did was all intravenous never tried anything through the nose and there was a minister by a doctor um and it does they they need to get rid of it all Mindy get rid of it all this not all the regulations actually think some of the regulations are great and I actually am a I'm actually somewhat Pro regulation of the edible market um III famously on record bitching about how shitty things were even last year I Lin that was world because there was just so much shakin re going on and just you know flagrant lying uh you know uh fairy and that will go away you know because everything has to be lab tested so really everything will be truthful and that will be great for consumers but it sucks that they you know or they have no choice they can trust they get yeah they don't they have the same they get um but ironically the black markets still gonna be flourishing with shitty products out there lying about their you know percentages and whatnot anyway so who knows and uh let's see Willy Wonka wants to know um have you ever played forsaken world on Perfect World Entertainment I have not and I'm not even sure what that is Willy Wonka let me know I will check it out yes Sally O'Malley I hear you sell you'll now he says I want to make a card and for a long time period of time smoking wears off too quickly exactly Sally O'Malley who wants to keep sitting somewhere smoking over and over again to reach the same point when you can just eat something and be done with it that's exactly the way I feel um all right uh yes Jeff thank you man I uh I hope to see you one day - later later man have a good night jack daniel\u00b4s thanks for chucking in man alright uh best jungle boys weeds are the best - bye I will check out jungle boys thank you for the recommendation Richard you Chernobyl that is a scary name digs a Chernobyl is a name of something I don't think I would want to put in my body um and barely functional says I agree that we need some regulation but damn it that they went too far and ruined good things incredibly true but what can you expect from government right it's not overreaction what is what kind of reaction can you expect only overreaction um just put in forsaken world and check it out and just in my search bar or Sagan world it's an MMO of some kind featuring vampires and hardcore PvP I might have to pick it out ah um and then a sweet butterfly says mr. weeks I have you ever infused a full gram of wax into shatter into an edible and what is your recipe technique of choice I am not believe it or not I have never infused actual wax or uh or shatter into into edibles uh actually I really I've done some making of edibles but not as much as you would expect I would check out some of the other people here on YouTube for those recipes there are some great YouTube rest are getting people out here on YouTube making things with oil resin and wax I check them out I'm sorry now I can't be more help but I I want to make sure you get yourself a good recipe and I am NOT the go-to guy for that unfortunately um and Frank Castle says welcome by the way Punisher and says do you ever make your own edibles just answer that very very rarely not as often as I should I would like to get into it more I just didn't have a very big kitchen and I'm also a terrible I'm just um I'm terrible in the kitchen i I'm just not good at I have no sense of I didn't know it's a learned skill and I'm making just making excuses but I really don't have any sense of making things than the kitchen I'm bad at it but I'd like to do it more especially about in a nicer kitchen all right mark have a good night man we'll see you soon uh thank you for hanging out buddy we'll talk to you uh soon or I will see you uh talking next week if not before later dude um and Michael wants to know uh have I ever read dfw have I ever read dfw I have read all of his essays uh and I have read the first 300 pages of Infinite Jest and have never made it past that point and it is something I am very very very embarrassed about um I love David Foster Wallace's essays I think he is probably the best essayist he's probably my personal favorite essayist ever yeah I don't know anybody who writes anything better than consider the lobster or supposedly fun thing I'll never do again what's the Angry Men one that's probably my favorite collection of this essays the end the one about men that are angry or something you can be incredible collection of essays David Foster Wallace better than his fiction I've never read any of this fiction other than 300 pages of Infinite Jest twice which I fail but I love his essays um and a black man er says he finally watched I love dogs Congrats what a great great movie absolutely loved it um my god Wes Anderson knows how to make a movie uh there was some part about me uh oh Kappa hey what it's up Kappa how are you doing man how is a house life how is are things with the permittee going I remember last time it was in a bit of a state of limbo but that was a couple of months ago um uh so Michael are you saying get back to it with with Infinite Jest like I should get back to Infinite Jest yes brief interviews with hideous men that's it Michael loved that one that's my favorite collection of his essays uh Edie wants to know if anybody has ever told me that I sound like shaggy from scooby-doo that is awesome lol it is weird that you say that um and because nobody has ever said that I sound like shaggy but people say that I won my voice is going forced cuz I haven't done this in a while so that's that's a small excuse and I'll use that my voice is starting to go a little bit hoarse because I've been talking for so long and I haven't done these live streams since the late April so my voice is a little hoarse um but people all the time tell me that I sound like I have I send like I'm on radio like they people will ask me like oh do do I do to the radio your voice sounds familiar are you doing are you guys you know are you a DJ or what you you know your voice sounds familiar um and I find that strange because shaggy in case you don't know was Casey Kasem the most famous DJ perhaps ever uh you know the top 40 guy for years and years and years was was Casey Kasem and and he's a famous radio guy and I not sure if that is weird anybody else but I made that connection um so did see temple why did your other youtube channel get banned I'm sorry Kappa what happened man um and uh Modesto wants to know has the animal kicked in boy howdy has it I would say I am up to about I'm definitely in the eight range now and having a really good time chatting with everybody so yeah I'm quite high I'm quite high it was definitely kicked in um I did know that Michael I did know that for sure I know that that was John Krasinski's first movie and it's not very good I saw it way back in 2009 I think Asst 2008 or 2009 when it came out did not like it uh it's I'm so glad to see that mr. krichinsky has gone on to do such better things including this year's great horror movie a quiet place I hope people still like that movie I hope the internet doesn't hate that movie I don't I don't know I found it quite good the reviews were quite good at the time I don't know where the internet bash backlash cycle is on it because I find um there's there's a sort of cycle to internet love of things there's a big love then comes the backlash then comes the counter backlash then comes the love and then ultimately the opinion is the thing is overrated and then everything sort of falls into that that mold and I I don't know if a quiet place has gone through that entire cycle or if it even got you know hitting the ringer if it was popular enough to have been put there made a lot of money so it seems like it should um oh guys also um I don't know if you know this I do have an x-men power and I can show it off for you right here right now I have a strange ability if you give me a movie that casts come out since the year 2001 and has made at least fifty million dollars at the box office I can give you the year it came out uh just try me try me and I won't use my fingers I'm gonna use my fingers um okay sorry that was a lot of ranting uh black vendor says more like the Roger Lodge voice I don't know who Roger Lodge is but now I'm curious I'll look him up uh uh and Edwards that says oh yes that's who you sound like awesome very cool um oh my god Michael no I did not I did not recognize your name as a character from Infinite Jest are you one of the kids from the tennis school or one from the debate thing or I really a failed reading that book twice I mean like it's it has kicked my ass I [ __ ] hate those footnotes to no end uh it just it's too weird it's too weird for me it's too and I have read the house of the House of Leaves by mark Z Danielewski and that wasn't too weird for me but I just I cannot make infinite just work for me I cannot put it together man uh um so bright castle says what games do you play while stoned um uh what games do I play wall stone uh I'd like to play things like slay the spire which we talked about before I don't like playing anything competitive while high for sure I like to play things where I have where the turn structure is very loose things like those things late aspire where there's not like a lot of constant input needed from the player so bored and card games do that pretty well and I like to do things I like to do things better very colorful games that that more platforming based things things that are very bright expressive so kind of Nintendo kind of things I like those a lot cuz they're don't require a lot of you know to follow along to anything you're just kind of you know in that world and and it's bright and colorful and very inviting to somebody is quite high so it's like Nintendo games to all high a great Castle says they are making a quiet place sequel yes they are I don't know uh how that will turn out whispers you with the ending that movie but we'll see um I don't think it'll they don't have a chance of being as good as the first one but I'd love to be proven wrong um and uh Roger Lodge did the show blind date I know that show now I now know Roger Lodge and it's I find it curious that my voice under that um and Michael is threatening you to go back to Infinite Jest again I might it is it is on my pile of shame it is something I want to read it is something I want to say that I've read more than I actually want to read it so I can sound caught parties you know like oh I've read Infinite Jest I'm like man girl like the women will just go ripping their tops off guys will be you know looking at me like Jordan Peterson you read info jest you might as well call yourself [ __ ] Joe Rogan because all the Conservatives are going to be coming for you no that's not true is David Foster David Foster Wallace does he have any conservative fans out there I know he used to I know he used to have a conservative you know like this weird conservative fan base which never made sense to me with his writing but it's somehow resonated to those wackos I hope that's no longer the case um because I know that's not what he is ah so and let's get back uh um to these questions here Carlos says do I listen to Tame Impala I don't think I've ever heard Tame Impala and hello Carlos by the way um oh I get that Michael I get that but man they're still difficult to read um and straigh says does the spider-man game interest you straight I am an insomniac bro from back in the in Spyro the Dragon days on ps1 dawg I could not be more excited for spider-man I have got my pre-order ready I got my ps4 Pro warmed up gimme - spider-man let me Spidey love me insomniac cannot wait cannot wait cannot wait cannot wait um boom uh so uh Anthony says this guy is so underrated I refer to me thank you so much that's very kind if you're referring to somebody else that's kind of for you to say to them as well yes that's the the phrase that I wanted to say Michael uh but I find that word hard to say to be entirely honest it's it's my moist that's a weird thing to say - uh mega $0.64 going to bed now uh uh awesome man have a good night if I'm sorry if I missed you so great seeing you man so great talking to you looking forward to talking any more soon good night mega uh Oh David Foster Wallace is definitely definitely definitely definitely a liberal uh I just know that he had a conservative fan base um which always I always found incredibly odd knowing David Foster Wallace you know David Foster Wallace politics um uh oh and uh and I know Jordan Pederson is not a conservative I know that I just know he has a lot of concern of fans I'm gonna I'm not a Jordan Peterson hater I'm not a fan but I'm not a hater um but but I just know he has a lot of conservative out there um and oh that's so great that you read is it Gerardo Gerardo Gerardo I'm sorry if I'm saying it wrong I'm so sorry if that's the case Gerardo Gerardo Gerardo you read dark money if you read it I am so glad that is so great oh you have no idea how happy that makes me I'm legitimately happy that makes me to see that somebody read that base in my recommendation anybody reading any you know dark money and one more person reading that book that's just one more educated person out there oh my god and is that book you know if it was relevant when I was published how much more relevant it is today uh and continues to be is mind-boggling because those people never went away i those the the Mercer's and the cokes oh my god they're still out there and my god are they still influential and my god is that money still rolling in dark money guys Jay Maher a journalist for The New Yorker dark money one of the as I expressed in that cherry on top video truly one of the few books that I would describe as a paradigm shifting I knew about dark money before I knew about the pernicious of collective you dark money and all that but you don't understand its influence and you don't understand how pathological these guys are until you read dark money um holy [ __ ] it will you will think about the world in a different way having read that book um Jenny obeisance ugh thank you so much Danny appreciate that um and Michael says Chad is going to be just you and me so we can get down to brass tacks man I'd love to talk some philosophy and some dfw with you I have so many interests that's part of the problem is man I just love so many things like I love so many things you know like I love love things um uh yes and some of the right is nihilistic um for short uh and Andrew Doolin says we're in Tennessee are you from I am from Knoxville Tennessee a nice little city uh I like Knoxville I do not like East Tennessee I do like Knoxville even if said uh something contrary to that in the past it is a nice nicety it is a city on the upswing it is growing and there are a lot of encouraging signs coming out from it um but East Tennessee is a flaming trash heap and it holds the whole state back and unfortunately even you know the three four big metropolis is in the state of Tennessee which are all lovely Memphis Nashville Knoxville and Chattanooga uh are all very nice nice cities and easy to recommend to live especially place you know with family if you have a family um maybe not Nashville cuz it's so goddamn expensive now from what I understand but every other place in the state that isn't those places is toxic [ __ ] waste goddamn huh alright um black Mariner says dark money's an awesome book oh he wrote it too yes yes um Jenny has three packs pods also oh I did not know Jenny also made packs pods I used to do jetty uh back in like 2060 when they first were coming out with cartridges and I really liked Jenny back when it was a much smaller market it was like Jenny brass knuckles and open uh you know were some of the only ones out here in Long Beach for a long time and I really liked jetting back in the day um Sally O'Malley says I'm ordering it now oh that's so great you really enjoyed uh yeah it's just it's it's a juggernaut of investigate an investigatory journalism love it love it love it oh my god uh Michael I am very curious now to see this mensches mulled bug I don't even know what mensches is I thought it was mendacious when you first typed it out that's a word I know what that means what is mention I have a feeling it's gonna be oh he's just a full he's a philosopher oh okay okay he's a philosopher he's a Chinese philosopher I did not know that Carlos says if I tried to LSD twice no really enjoy it both times on although uh-oh guys I'm sorry I have to message my spouse for a second one second guys okay cool now back to the chrome skis uh wait he isn't that isn't no oneness oh no no no no no no sorry um no I I understand that Michael might my back I didn't know what the name Mints and ice don't know how to pronounce it because you know trying to pronounce anything in Mandarin this is it goddamn trap for anybody who doesn't know what they're doing I just didn't know what what that hoo-hoo I understood that it was one thing um but but I thought mention word or was that like an adjective or something not not a person but but this guy mention smoke bug is named after this dude this philosopher that Sally O'Malley thank you so much for joining in we're so glad you came thank you thank you and I I really hope you enjoyed dark money Sally let me know um I absolutely will Carlos thank you for the recommendation let me go ahead and add that right now to uh-uh done on the list thank you um oh hell yes uh Andrew Dylan I have seen him and what he's doing the Lord's [ __ ] work guy is doing the Lord's work he needs to get his message out for um I I would love to uh work with him in some way and in helping him I mean not that I'm bitter not that I have any reach but like my small reach I would love to help him get his word out because he is doing the Lord's [ __ ] work good on him good on him eight plus eight plus um uh okay uh Anjali is that how we say it uh we did man the whole brownie finished it off about one hour ago and I am still on the ride up I'd still say I'm somewhere in the eights but still going up um hey Joe welcome welcome uh I don't know that one Michael uh Hector I have all three of them reviewed I have all three of the Delta nines reviewed their uh their espresso one their salted caramel and their milk chocolate and they're all [ __ ] incredible I can tell you across the board man uh if you haven't some ideas go watch him please I'd really appreciate you watching him um but I will give you a hint Delta nine is awesome awesome awesome awesome you'll love them check them out um really really happy with Bill tonight um so yes I've reviewed all three of their of their their 240 milligrams chokolate and they're all great all worthy of recommendation um okay uh I am so sorry but I need to get back to a Gerardo's question which is any more books you recommend which is a question that I am delighted by uh and that is uh yes yes yes let me go ahead and give you my favorite non-fiction book I have ever read um and uh it was something I did as a cherry on top so I apologize if you've seen it but um it is something I've recommended to many people something I will continue to recommend probably for the rest of my life it is the single most optimistic piece of writing I've ever encountered the thing that makes me most hopeful about humanity and humanity's future it is book called the beginning of infinity by a David Deutsch an Oxford professor an Oxford professor of quantum physics I think don't let that scare you in any way shape or form um I wouldn't say it's the most approachable reading is it it's a little difficult to read at points so there's some things that go down some rabbit holes but you do not have to have you do not to be scientifically literate to read it not at all you just have to approach it with an open mind and and maybe with a little bit more attention than then like yes um you would find him like the pop science aisle not saying that pop science writing is bad I love pop science writing I love pop science writing um but um yeah it's just a little bit more from you but this book the beginning of infinity is basically David Joyce's argument that there is and no problem that the human brain when when when when sufficiently gathered together and when allowed to flourish so given the right circumstances to flourish when enough people gather together there is literally no problem that they sort of cannot not solve and I know that sounds sort of like a trite almost packed message but it is not because he doesn't he in no way backs up his message with simple platitudes he delves deep into why that this is the case and and why optimism is something we should both strive for as as society we should be an optimistic species and and and and why we should foster things that that create Universal creativity metaphor he uses brilliant brilliant must check it out the beginning of infinity by david deutsch de UT s hg some like that out on them love it um uh Carlos says uh um [Music] have I ever reviewed the flavor rx cartridges I have reviewed one of them and it was not my favorite I did not hate it but I have reviewed a lot better things but the flavor cartridges are usually pretty affordable which is a one thing to consider and they usually the shit-ton of strains and you know varieties and all kinds of things I will be reviewing they have they're really heavily into the disposable joints model which I've never even tried which is something we're gonna be doing in season three reviewing some of those disposable joints and they have a ton of them so we'll definitely be doing some of those looking at those as well I think they're a big player in that space um uh oh men Delta nines cartridges are allegedly shady AF that is really really sad that is really sad not just not only just because their chocolates amazing and I love them for the fact of their chocolate but because I see a lot of people recommending their cartridges to me like people are often telling me to to try their cartridges I just haven't seen them yet to review them but that's bad to know that many people are being you know affected if in fact there's something shady going on there um shattered tank brand is the most consistent cards I've ever had I will definitely check that out Joe uh where do you find those Joe of the shattered tank brand i will check them out for sure and then g-money says do you receive free samples from any edible companies great question and something I love to address often and bring this up as often as I can because I think it's something good for everybody to know um I've actually received very few free things I've turned down a lot of free things I have not accepted many many free things but but I haven't been offered a you know I'm not getting ten offers a day or anything like that I the only time I have ever received an edible that I have reviewed was the flourish CBD gummy which I reviewed I specifically because some a lot of people wanted me to review um a CBD gummy and flourish had asked me specifically to do so and I made sure in that review to mention it three times that they had provided the product for me so I have a background in journalism uh and I just know how not just that but the YouTube is lousy and especially and sadly the weed side of YouTube is just lousy lousy lousy with people with with the payola good old-fashioned pale or you know shady quid pro quo [ __ ] and it's bad it's bad and it's really does a disservice to anybody watching that stuff and anybody are trying to educate us so I try to divorce that stuff as much as possible every product other than that flourish one flourish CBD going a better viewed I've paid for out of pocket um totally out of my own pocket um which is the way I will continue to go for the foreseeable future I won't say that I won't ever do another I definitely wanted to say would never do another free product something that somebody sends me and do a review on it but if I do you will definitely know about it and many many times I will let you know about it because I think it's crucially important that people know that that that that I may have some bias even though I don't think I would I am would try very hard not to but it's important that people know that there might even be the an appearance of a bias I very genuinely firmly believe that and I think some of the most shady [ __ ] and journalism is the [ __ ] where somebody gets a you know flown to a movie premiere in Maui and it's you know put up in the four seasons and then as told to review the latest Transformers movie and then they might give it you know a little bit more positive review than anybody I don't and you know they claim there's no bias but when they don't disclose that [ __ ] I find it very very shady um very very shitty sorry for that rant sorry for that rip guys uh Thank You Willy Wonka I hope so that would be great and that would be great uh I wish I could deliver to you to Steven I wish I could get you to you mr. Zuniga I hope Texas gets their [ __ ] together soon but Vader O'Rourke and maybe maybe you guys will get get on that recreational map soon enough uh cannabis drives terpenes only so many of the companies don't use terpenes that come from real cannabis plants so so true Landon says when are you gonna eat the thousand milligrams Landon you missed it dog I finished the whole thing about an hour ago uh I'm still getting higher from it I I'm still going up but uh but I finished it an hour ago and it tasted really bad you missed a lot of this ah [ __ ] God dim oh what the oh you missed a lot of that so I'm sorry you had to miss those Jim Carrey level facial contortions but that's what you get for me late uh Zephyr Zephyr says heavy hitters are my favorite brand I love heavy hitters too my boy I think they're much better than brass knuckles uh they're my third favorite brand behind steezy and orchid that I have tried it so far really like heavy hitters it's hard tastes clean nice um and Andrew Dylan's going for this full spectrum oils from here on out only oh my god I did not know that Andrew Dylan thank you again for letting me know that is bad I I need to do I need to check out more of this guy's Instagram obviously I'm not doing my due diligence I mean I do my due diligence the time to check everything before reviewing it but his stuff never comes up on Google search for his Instagram things but just looking up you know lab testing results because most of these companies post I guess fabricated lab testing results or Bloch lab testing results that seems like quite the scandal maybe some you should be investigating into that if you're out there um what is the weed magazine high times a man I used to be a science writer wait I still AM hit me up um thank you mister hi Huck thank you thank you uh I really appreciate that Tom s uh I wish I thank you so much I appreciate the concern thanks for welcoming back and I really really wish you could get there too man I hope your area of the world comes around soon and gets their head on straight and realizes that uh you know it's a [ __ ] ton better than oxy cotton or fentanyl so goddamn god damn I'm starting to become less articulate at this point as my arguments aren't bullying down to largely just me going god damn god damn but that's what you get um uh so Michael says you should go all the way to the right politically speaking far-right is much better than other political opinions that is an interesting opinion a very interesting opinion um one I would be very interested to see argue in a in a in a sensible fashion but one you are entitled to um a win do you think if the government will finally reschedule cannabis the question Willie Wonka is will they ever um because not to get too political here Willy Wonka but we don't it's it's it's hard to know whether uh any left-leaning administration will ever be in charge of the Oval Office again right and that's the only way that cannabis will ever be rescheduled is when is if somebody of the opposite political persuasion who is currently in party would be in party in order to do it but there are reasons to believe that that may never be the case but maybe all cause there um Josh's uh he's back in his high spot welcome back I'm glad your highest [ __ ] I'm high AF too and Steve's Anika says where am i from again I am so sorry I live in Long Beach California um a suburb a satellite city of Los Angeles it's hard to call it definitely not a suburb uh it is uh I guess the it's just a huge sitting right outside of Los Angeles like half an hour outside of La it's the city of like half a million I love it you've probably heard of it almost everybody has all right mr. hawk says uh that's what you get haha and I don't remember what that was in reference to if you would post what that was in reference to because I'm too high to my short-term memory is certainly starting to be affected I can't work what that was reference to UM I've seen you mention the insane sales tax numerous times you should protest and only buy from one of the churches and your Dylan that's not such a bad idea uh I will be completely 100% honest here while I have a patrin eyes the legal dispensaries in Long Beach many times and purchased many products from them when I go to purchase the stuff that I like to use not you know just not for weeks basically just any other [ __ ] timely like you know later tonight eyes go get it from black market sources because as much as I was on my high and mighty about like oh I'll pay any kind of tax as long as it's legal and non can be a good boy scout yadda yadda not true man uh when you're paying that level of sales tax upon already higher prices that the dispensaries charges Plus that sales tax I mean you're talking a price discrepancy of literally plus you know anywhere in the ballpark of plus 35 to 70 percent in price for anything for any product not you know flower edibles whatever between the black market and the legal dispensaries Alex 835 is on the very low end of the you know the price discrepancy and when you're also this yeah so I I have still purchased a lot of stuff from black market sources just because I'm a hypocrite I'm sorry um so uh and that's what I begin to do I'm not yes yes very true and you're Dylan Daniel says what do I think about marijuana for teens uh I think other than in the cases where you're doing like CBD for you know as like an anti-seizure medication you know for epilepsy or you know other the truly medical purposes I do not think teens should probably be doing weed uh it's only one study and there's you'd be foolish you'd be foolish to uh you know um base anything really off the off anyone study but there there is a fairly convincing study out there suggesting that marijuana can impede you know can be impedes a harsh word but can be somewhat detrimental to brain development to anybody less than the age of 25 even um so really I don't think teens should be doing it and they're going to do it obviously I mean I'm not [ __ ] stupid I'm not naive so I think they should be able I don't know it's that double-edged sword you know it's for for their health they shouldn't be doing it obviously but then again nobody should be doing it for their help because outside of you know the large pool of people who legitimately need it for their health but that's not the majority of people using weed so don't be a hypocrite there but yeah I don't know III don't think teens should be doing it I I think they should wait till they're you know in their 20s to start doing weed I don't think they should be drinking I definitely don't think they should be drinking either uh I would much rather have a teenager smoking weed than drinking I will say that for sure that is definitely true uh but I would rather have them do neither if that were the case because you don't want to [ __ ] with your brain uh right I mean you can [ __ ] with a lot you know just you don't want to you don't want to mess with your brain plus there are the the studies you know the correlation causation here right but the studies about weed and schizophrenia and how there's you know definitely a correlation between young people using weed and schizophrenia arising but it could be a chicken it's very likely that they were likely driven to do we because of their schizophrenia and not the other way around but I know they're here now they're um um so uh uh Michael says the question wheats is do we believe in evolution as outlined by Charles Darwin natural selection is occurring at all times we are pursuing genic ends or dis genic ends untrue untrue Michael that is not the way survival of the fittest or natural selection really works that is that is a misconception um survival of the fittest uh is a phrase that has been uh is is a is a phrase that has been maladapted by people on the eugenics end of the spectrum to justify all kinds of horrendous [ __ ] it is a hundred percent the case that uh in social animals social creatures protect those that are physically weaker than them for the good of the whole society and that goes absolutely true for humanity just because on one metric whatever metric it is that he used to judge people that you would use to determine whether they are worthy or not whatever that metric is doesn't mean that the other things that aren't measured by that metric would it be more than beneficial and compensated by the people that the things the people that you do want are lacking it's it's absurd to think that actually that's that's not how social animals evolve at all that's not it's never how social successful social animals have evolved so by will the finish for social animals refers to survival of the the society the whole and and that includes keeping individuals that some you know yeah III don't know I'm sorry I'm getting getting way off topic I'm getting way off topic um uh oh Michael says you don't want to mess with your brain says the man who just ate a thousand milligram edibles good point and sick burn but I shouldn't mess with my brain in any permanent way that is the magic of weed uh that is the Trulie magic wonderfully my brain should not be I'm not killing brain cells uh if anything I'm gonna open new neuronal pathways that I did not have open before whatever referring to in terms of like teenagers is simply it can impede brain development it can [ __ ] brain development and and and that is a wholly different thing than Tamarack temporary chemical changes within the brain sorry to be pedantic that was pedantic but I'm sorry uh Steven Zuniga says oh [ __ ] I missed it I don't know uh what you missed and Andrew Dylan says how old was I when I first smoked I was 26 actually when I first smoked I was 26 years old I promised myself I was never going to smoke weed until it was legal uh and I ironically I broke that promise when California was the first state to vote on recreational weed back in like 2011 and voted it down and I thought to myself well that's it it's never gonna be legal anywhere if California doesn't make it legal I might as well smoke so I smoked in East Tennessee then and then sure enough next year was one like what was it what states made it legal to begin with Colorado and Washington made it legal and I was like oh I was pleasantly very wrong so but I continued to smoke anyways so I was 26 I think um later Willy Wonka have a good night man hey Michael thank you so much man oh dude you're so right Mike Oh guys I'm gonna I'm gonna pause for one second positive I'm gonna go get a fresh drink this drink is so warm BRB oh my dogs let's go dogs who was that recommend I take a sip of water oh my god mr. hawk thank you for recommending this I really needed this and Thank You mr. Palmer for your delicious concoction the corruption haha well word oh it's like blue footed boobie or kumquat oh can you believe you can say kumquat what the [ __ ] kind of world do we live in I can go around and go to a grocery store and ask a person for a kumquat and they won't look at me as if I'm some kind of deviant they might even point me somewhere hand me something toward kumquat it's a real word and it's spelled in a really weird way guys would have to be um alright I might be too high for evolution barely functional I might have the transcendent evolution and I might be I might I might have hid the singularity I appoint the past of your petty biological evolutionary [ __ ] uh what Aaron no you don't Aaron oh my god oh my god buddy Oh Oh buddy oh my god that's so nice of you you know what to give me money that's so kind I'm Wow thank you seriously you know you don't have to give me money I promise uh um no dude seriously um nobody has to give me money it's not what I um I it's very very very very generous and I I'm blown away but like Wow um thank you um and I I'm sorry I'm sorry Aaron Bret I have been completely absent for three months and I have responded to no comments I have not been alive on social media I have done nothing that is irresponsible and bad form bad bad for him I'm going to slap my hand as if I am its hablar reaching for a hot stove and don't slap your toddler's hand reaching for a hot stove don't hit your kid you [ __ ] [ __ ] god damn um but uh yes I'm sorry I am sorry that I'm in a way man thank you I don't know but I don't want money sorry what was I saying before um so if our senses evolved as a means to survive in the physical realm how can we know that our senses are interpreting is it actually refractive of the world around us Michael your senses aren't definitely not reflective of the world around you we do not live in anything that looks like what would be considered an objective reality right I mean everything that a human is is filtered through so many bizarro weirdos I mean like your your well your five senses lol your not your many more sensors than five that's only that's all they teach you and whatever grade school but yeah what there's no [ __ ] way that those five senses can can come close there's like very very limited senses because you know your eyesight isn't you you're limited to a certain spectrum of color that you can see you know a shrimp can see like ten times the amount of color ah man thank you God thank you so much ha that's really kind man I really I really appreciate that thank you thank you so much man um so uh Wow why I'm totally lost where I was um why do I never feel like this when I'm high lost ooh lost lost has there ever been a show like lost will there ever be a show like lost again lost was a plus was an objective disappointment in the end I think for me but god damn am i there was never really anything else like it in terms of I I remember I would organize groups for group watches and we get excitedly talked about it and how they just you west world might be the closest thing or I mean guess Game of Thrones to Kemah throughs I forgot about that that would be it but watch still felt difference in how um that was that was a real real Wow left turn there and I think I made a right turn with my hand uh Frances says can I go for two thousand milligrams for ten when we had ten thousand I'll do two thousand how about that when we hit 10,000 I'll do two thousand that's the deal that's the deal barely functional says who doesn't want money and that is somebody who was raised to believe that they are objectively worthless and then musu made a nice joke and Andrew Dylan says what brought you out west and that was uh Andrew Dylan um what brought me out west was wanting to escape East Tennessee and wanting to live in a place with just a better I don't want I don't know um I just East Tennessee is it is a not as I said before Knoxville is not a terrible place Knox was actually a very charming little city but the other wise man there are just some really bad people there just a lot of garbage human beings which is bad to say I know you're not supposed to really you know typify a whole group like that but man I I grew up with all the you know with some of the worst of the worst of them and they're just garbage people man and they just bring it down with them and I wanted to be in place with people who have a more pleasant outlook on humanity if that makes any sense yeah cool um did it that do uh Cynthia Glen says compare the quality of high you're getting from this as compared to say a can ago my all-time faves Cynthia I would say right now I am equivalent to about what you would consider a about a five hundred milligram candy coat in that range for me what I do edibles I don't really have very rarely do I have things in terms of highs that I would determine us like different kinds of highs when I do edibles it's usually just a very vanilla generic overall stone feeling and and so even low quality edibles as long as they have sufficient THC will make me feel so pleasantly high so like even though this is nowhere near as good in quality in terms of things like ingredients sir you know it been the team she is it's not a thousand milligrams in here I don't I don't think it's a thousand other comes in here to be honest it's it's not it's it's definitely oh five hundred or over but I'd say it's about a five hundred equivalent to a five hundred milligram Kentico which is nothing to sneeze at five hundred milligram Kanako's put me on my ass to this day as this is doing I don't want to do this as a slam to enjoyable animals I mean but this this is not nearly as good as a say a Korova our black bars it's it's not it's not in the same league really as that but it got me sufficiently stoned but again I enjoyable animals would not be my first friend but seeing as how one of the they're one of the last few large scale somewhat reliable black-market brands that do over a hundred milligrams maybe you got to go with what you got you know I don't know um what that radio labs story is [ __ ] I didn't know that Michael um Andrew um I do feel that there is a difference between an edible high and a high from flower even at equivalent levels that is one high i would differentiate um I don't know I wouldn't say the edible high is more psychedelic in any way in some ways it may be less psychedelic equivalently for me I I don't know it's it's it's a more of a mellow feeling for me then then they just doing flowers so like an equivalent amount of flour or any other concentrate or whatever yeah edibles do it is a little bit different for me then then other influence I guess which is a weird way to describe them um where were we nothing beats the taste of Kanako's says Cynthia Glenn I can get four awesome soaring highs out of one can of co-products five five high five high five totally agree with you love can't Co it is really I mean it is bittersweet that's how we'll describe it that they're going totally legit because I they they seem to have all their [ __ ] together for the new regulations so bittersweet and then it seems like they're doing well and that they might be competing you know with the big voice and and have their [ __ ] together but a little bitter in that it means we will never get there you know five hundreds or thousands ever again unfortunately alright and Michael says you must finish reading Infinite Jest so you can understand the false god that is hidden ISM chasing pleasure weed videogames dopamine related activities is a pathway to despair well isn't that a very DFW style argument and um that there is merit to that argument absolutely I I don't I don't disagree with that um but uh that is not a universal truth uh not in any way shape or form uh it's all out where you told like you in some ways can contribute or some sense of meaningfulness and and pleasure activities don't necessarily give life meaningfulness but they absolutely can uh and that's that's a very important thing like uh in some way I would say doing weights gives my while it's a hedonistic activity sure doing edibles as often as I do for absolutely sure but at the same time having this structure and being able to like share this information with people gives it meaning and gives it meaning to me at least gives it a reason gives it a you know even if it's a false narrative even if it's when I'm creating my own head it gives me a you know a are a reason for doing this a justification for it and one that I derive purpose from so uh so I you know I I do I totally don't completely refute your point because there there is merit to that argument that chasing pleasure or vices will inherently just lead to on you know dissatisfaction but that's not if you if you give meaning to the pleasure that is not the case or I think so at least and maybe Foster Wallace was wrong because you kill himself maybe but also very cruel cruel joke also that movie about him is really good with the Jesse this Eisenberg and the big guy Jason Segel end of the tour it's good it's good you should watch it that director is really good except he did one big movie it's terrible but it's two movies before that is spectacular now and Smasher both really good um so Andrew said is there a brand a prepackaged flower that I like team genetic is the best multiple Cannabis Cup wins I have never tried at Team Elite genetics but I will now absolutely be on the lookout for it thank you and in terms of prepackaged read I have I am loyal to none I have no favorite growers I I barely notice you know what farm or the pack I mean when is something borderline ostentatious like this grow packaging I mean I I love kirova and they're cool packaging a lot of cool packaging but god damn is this is a little excessive because this isn't cheap yeah so I I don't have a particular favorite now so Michael says my meeting comes from a desire to will myself to greatness pursuit of improvement and perfection also a false narrative but at least in its pursuit I will gain social dominance and the tort uh and I say to you Michael I say uh uh IIIi hope you you you you find your inner John Galt I hope you find him um into Torah right the right wing view of the world dis seven Cesare am I ever gonna try kingpin cartridges yes sir dis seven they are absolutely on the list time for a quick plug wheat season 3 coming again guys coming at you again in October

woods for as popular as they are um and then michael says hell yeah hell yeah know what Michael the end of the tour movie it's good you should watch it you'll like it you'll learn something I got it

20th century a [ __ ] goddamn robber baron party whoo what you high off says David I'm high off enjoy enjoyable animals 1000 guys I can't [ __ ] this up here's what I'm a high office 1000 milligram blackout brownie I've changed my setup I am I'm actually I'm I'm at a different spot than I've ever been in weeks HQ before I'm broadcasting from my Mac which I've never broadcast me before I've always broadcast from the PC side but now I'm broadcasting from Mac and I keep looking into my Mac but the camera is not on the Mac and it's just confusing to everybody and I'm sorry and that's why I keep like pointing like things at that when I keep pointing at my stupid laptop instead of pointing at the camera and fear the beard I am high off life sir Steve says let me get 15 bucks dawg I got 15 bucks Oh Michael we couldn't debate the merits of eugenics today shucks may we never have that conversation um Oh Darrin says I need a nice walk Oh goddamn you know how great a walk would be with some music right now put in those earbuds and just be like mmm wait I don't listen to music that makes you do this and I don't know if I've ever done that in my life until that moment actually the only time I've ever moved my shoulders I think is when I've simulated dancing or pantomime did dancing I don't think when I've really danced I've done this thing um cars - Oh cars - is a tricky tricky tricky one ooh oh [ __ ] cars 2 is an actual tricky one uh because it came out significantly after the first cars and then cars 3 came out shortly thereafter IFS jenner july cars - but what year I literally I don't know he's it the year after I'm gonna say cars - June 2011 I'm gonna say it was there one after Toy Story 3 but I don't know that actually I'm that's the biggest um purse that's a stumper cars - is a stumper I'll give you that one um so Walker pizza oh my god what a choice that is that is in fact Sophie's Choice if somebody said you know somebody put a gun right up to the a walk or a pizza and said only one of these is surviving this night you're either gonna have a pleasant walk or you're gonna enjoy a goddamn DiGiorno [ __ ] you can only have one which do you choose call me meryl streep because Whiston Meryl Streep and Sophie's Choice I think I've never seen it and I don't know who she chooses but I know who I choose but I'll never tell okay uh Michael says pull up some serious aesthetic a very good stone music I appreciation the recommendation I will actually do that I will as soon as they get off here I will pull that up because I'm looking forward to some oral aural not oral guys are oh hey you are are al why I stimulation not oral oh are that all the O's and horse neighs nails he's at them that must be uh and then you'll give up your right-wing beliefs forever Michael I have a feeling one I think tolls to was the best answer of the night and two I have a suspicion about who you might be IRL but I'll never say um uh and June 2011 you're right yes yes okay uh Steve's Nina says the cat hat movie is November 2001 or November 2002 oh it's November I'm going November 2001 for cat in a hat movie oh and this seven says best snack to eat wall hi um the best snack to eat wall high is not the best food to eat while high which I would contend is a very important distinction and worthy of some discussion perhaps I don't know but best snack would hi man I really like ah Jesus that is if that's another stumper of a question because I originally went to something salty and then I was like well I get tired of salty then I was like well then you want something chocolaty then you're like well that'll get you you know you can get tired chocolate really quickly something I was like oh you know you never get tired of gummy worms but then it was like Oh after you know a half dozen gummy worms I'm really craving something salty but you can have too much salt that's really thinking about chocolate but then then thinking about you know how much chocolate and you get the Dookie squirts and then after that after a while you're like oh man I could really use some refreshing gummy snacks but then the gummy snacks aren't satisfying yes you like you eat a little bit of them and they're really too sugary and too sweet and too intense and you're like I could use something really salty and you know kind of crunchy don't wash this down oh damn it I was off by two years I'm sorry guys I'm sorry about the Cat in the Hat damn two years that one's embarrassing what can I say I'm a failure no it's a trick I mean it's weird sure but it's also kind of a trick because I'm really relying I'm relying on you not remembering movies that fit my you know only room relying on you remembering the huge movies that came out in that time frame and not the sort of smaller ones that fit my criteria and while most people probably don't know when spider-man one came out you know most people could get within a couple of years but you know it's just really more of like a parlor trick by like saying like oh I could do it these such specific parameters you're really only gonna pick from probably like Diddy movies or something not the you know certainly hundreds if not maybe thousands of movie no not thousands hundreds for sure movies they could fit that criteria that have classes that timeframe Rudy says ah how was the edible and it was it was good it was good uh it wasn't my favorite thousand milligram have all I've ever had those still go to the Korova black bars out there in the world with the asterisks that I'd never manage to actually try a can of code thousand milligrams but uh it was uh not bad I'm still I'm very high I think it got me to about how about an eight point five I think I've sort of plateaued there may maybe we'll have some no tremors here and there to a higher levels but we'll see um but overall I'd say it was a decent animal a decent interval maybe worth the money at forty bucks but but I don't feel totally totally ripped off especially in this black market era of high potency edibles uh and then Michael says have I ever heard of yukio mishima and the answer is no uh I will look him up right now though so barely functional um they were when they were still available I think they are well and truly gone at this point I mean at least in the easily accessible black market you know they are they're gone but they were they did range from you know I'd seen them price anywhere from as low as thirty five bucks which was a crazy deal up to I've seen them price as high as you know like seventy but that was an outlier but I said they normally arrange around forty to fifty more closer fifty wait was he the guy was he the guy who like rammed somebody with a katana on stage oh no but but why why is that why does that mean it wise it seems to me the Japanese getting their military back right after World War two would be a very bad thing I'm not sure why that would be something that the guy should be considered a badass for military cooze are generally bad things think right we'd still consider I don't know what I'm talking about though [Music] uh okay uh by we you mean me the denizens of the art right is that why Michael back Imperial Japan damn birds still there he's just waiting dog he's just waiting right the the Emperor still there oh no no no no no no Brent Brent no that's not true you just come in Oh Matthew dongho welcome I have eaten the whole bar about two hours ago now I am uh so high right now I would say I would say recapping about an eight five uh maybe a plateaued in that area I don't know if you know this Matthew being new but I have something of an abnormal tolerance for marijuana THC in particular something of a some people have somehow described this freakish on occasion or or disgusting or or sinful or disturbing or or righteous or pretty bitching or totally cool man alright Michael alright Michael I'll do that man no uh what I ate uh Brent was I ate a 1000 milligram a blackout brownie I did look I looked quite I put quite a bit of effort I put more effort into that then I put into really anything I put into over the last three months was I look for another cup of black bar but was coming up bone-dry um I had a and I had a couple of false positives which let me tell you that is a disappointment that's a real heartbreaker when you go somewhere that that's an advertised crop of black bars in Santa Ana and then they tell you oh they haven't actually had those for three months then you think to yourself well why is it on your website especially if it's been three months you know oh my lighting is all messed up would you guys like a little bit better lighting although guys I think I am uh-oh I have tried peach trees I've not done a review of them Brent but I do think the peach streets are better than the enjoy enjoyable edibles I'll give you that a piece of advice enjoy can be okay they can they actually have some decent products but they're not 100% consistent and they're goldfish take like tastes like dog poo poo they're goldfish are probably the worst tasting at well I've reviewed one of the worst cases usually the top three worst tasting animals I've ever had um so that's another strike um [Music] yes they do Cynthia and Brent you're right yes I totally agree it's I wish Brent they had not besmirched the name of the black bar I wish they had not taken the name of the black bar um bye and then you know purse merchants legacy by putting on this hundred million piddly nonsense you know just let that retire in its majesty and they and it's legend let it go out like like quaaludes or something you know just like you know well that's a bad analogy but you know what I'm saying like people have been talking about the black bar for years oh man you missed the great days when you could have gone down to the [ __ ] dispensary and got a thousand milligrams black bar from Korova uh thanks Brent I really appreciate that man I really appreciate that yes and Brent Duncan you are right it is the worst the worst edible uh well there there are some contenders out there that have recently had it for me but the 5150 bar is uh so bad it's it's yeah the the salted caramel bar is so beguiling ly bad because everything else from from um Corolla is so relatively good you know everything else is so comparatively decent like you know they're 250 milligrams cookies don't taste like dog [ __ ] and still hit really hard but somehow and and that the the other 500 milligram edibles are they taste 500 milligram animals but you know they are but they're not revolting I did every time I had one I tried it three times I mentioned my review I tried it twice before just to make sure I wasn't screwing up like I never got a bad batch no it's just that gross i rant about it all the time it really really makes me gag literally makes me gag all right guys I think I am gonna have to take a break if you see behind me I've got a little bit of an upset border collie who might needed to go take a deuce my voice is also starting to give away I've also had these hot lights on my carpet for a while so they might you know spontaneously burst into flames because I've been too lazy to raise it back up but I'm gonna turn those off I'm gonna take my dogs out for dumps and then I'm gonna check back in with you guys way more often until when we get wheats season 3 launched come in this October but we'll be checking in with you with more live streams before then I'll be checking in on social media and there may be some reviews between here and there but we'll have some new stuff up a fresh format some fresh I you know some fresh hopefully fresh logo some fresh banners things that might actually be relevant now hopefully all that's come over season three uh I have seen that movie uh Brent and it is a really good uh and I appreciate the recommendation though um it is a movie about music hey guys thank you so much for watching everybody this has been a blast sorry I have to bounce uh-huh voice is killing me dogs need to take a [ __ ] take care everyone it's been so much fun good night", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "LbDVvYE64Bk": "[Music] glory be friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and look at this little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace No hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll

we aim to help you make sense of that sprawling incomprehensible place you call your dispensary see the word sense is in dispensary that's why we say that also it's done boy I am a little rusty guys this is the first time I have been behind the camera doing a review since late April so that was about five months ago four months ago something like that so I'm a little rusty what we're doing here today guys is a classic wheats review we are not reviewing an edible today but instead we are going to be reviewing a cartridge and these reviews here are going to tide you over until wait season through season wait that's a W that's wheats season three three three three oh it's like two double use so wheat season three will be premiering I think it was a little optimistic before said October but don't worry wheat season three will be coming out probably mid-november at this point we're gonna have the deluge of content all that good stuff back up and running but for now we're gonna drip feed you some content between here and the official launch of wheat season three fingers crossed sometime mid November so uh we are talking cartridges today guys what are we talking today we are talking magic pipe the vaguely offensively logoed magic pipe cartridges using clear oil whatever that means well this is a thousand milligram a premium at babe cartridge or they so they say with 78 to 85 percent THC created by tested by independent labs but I don't see what lab tested it um it's got a lot of fancy words like proprietary winterization filter it's an all-natural blend ooh-la-la very sort of cheap looking cartridge I believe I picked this up from a black market dispensary here in Long Beach for 30 bucks for a gram cartridge which is pretty damn good a pretty good value but again I've never heard of a magic pipe before they don't seem to be an especially big brand but we will give them a shot and give them their fair shake so you can see the packaging they're a little unique it's got this little button here on the side that you sort of push in and then you pull the whole thing out just like that there's your cartridge there on the inside and I've already taken a little cap there off at the bottom but there was the little customary plastic cap there at the bottom so the tip is I can't tell if it is a very high quality plastic or if in fact it may actually be ceramic I don't know if the back doesn't say uh but as you can hear this thing is this thing is very very heavy dude this is not a cheap plastic tip if it's plastic this could be ceramic it is that sort of I mean it's almost like porcelain in a way so I've got my trusty 510 battery here actually there's my first time using this one I find 510 batteries no matter how much I spend on them all have a shelf life of about 6 weeks so I just now pick up the shitty cheap ones because they all suck if anybody can point me to a 510 battery that's gonna last me a year let me know I'd love to find that battery and just hold on to that one this one here is heavy-hitters branded by the way so we'll go ahead and screw in just standard 510 beep thread now first thing I would notice about this cartridge from magic pipe oh sorry I forgot to mention this is a sativa this is their Strawberry Cough variety normally go with Jack Herer if I stick with the sativa but they didn't have any jack so with the Strawberry Cough a real quick that does not look like a whole gram of oil to me um that definitely looks more like a half gram cartridge but what do I know we'll find out after we smoke it so here we go let's go ahead and take our inhalation and see what's gonna happen okay people criticize me for not holding my hit's long enough which is valid thank you for criticizing on that part hmm I tend not to hold them out but because as many of you have you accused me and as I have accused myself you got baby lungs son but let's get one more good draft out of it here there are those babies who lungs in action burns hot definitely burns a little hot came out piping but the flavor is pretty pretty pleasant um first strawberry cloth really like it's got that nice strawberry flavor um and I believe they say that this uses exclusively terpenes don't think it's naturally or artificially flavored anyway do you like the taste but I'm a little wary of how hot it burns coming out in terms of the tip normally I hate the plastic tips on the cartridges this time around however it's either that's ceramic or heavy duty plastic it's actually quite nice I'm easy to draw from it doesn't taste awful really like that design I said it's quite easy to draw from um I wasn't getting super super big drafts out of it a big clouds coming out of this one but that's ok I'm not a um quite ready for those big clouds just yet it seems to have several intake chambers not sure if the camera is gonna focus probably allowing for an easier drop and I see like maybe six holes there so plenty of ways to let the air and intake chambers all that good stuff and again the taste is on point pretty tasty but for the most important part am i any hi um yeah a little hi uh I would put this sort of in terms of how baked it got me off went probably good about five drawers there um I'm at a three four ish level more on the three end so about average four five drawers on a pen um it is certainly not the most potent cartridge I've ever had not even in the realm of closeness to potency um but it's it's certainly um better than some and for that price again I think I said I'd maybe pay 30 bucks for what they advertise is a whole gram well that's a pretty good value so so far I would give this one uh okay um but as with all of our wheats cartridge reviews guys I'm actually gonna smoke this whole thing down over the next couple of days hopefully if it's a whole gram a next four five six days and I will come back to you and give you my whole thoughts let you know if it's starting to burn even harder or if it started to taste funky towards the end when I thoughts in the pokey see all that good stuff I'll be coming back to you guys in the next couple of days again to give you my final thoughts on the magic pipe your other side strawberry sativa excuse me the Strawberry Cough sativa variety so guys thank you so much for watching to this point and I will see you in a couple of days for you just a couple of seconds and I will let you know what I think about our good friends over at magic pipe then thanks for watching see you soon [Music] eighty-four hours since the last time I've seen you find folks but that's not actually true because you saw me just a couple of seconds ago and I've never seen you but that's just a different way of saying it has been about three and a half days since I started the magic pipe which come on guys come on with that name come on do we really need that name that names bad you know that's why why why unless you know you're actually a Native American then I apologize but otherwise you know it's you just seem like you're asking for trouble who cares not to get a two in the weeds there we don't really care what it's named we care if it's gonna get you high or not and if this is gonna be a good cartridge overall and I just realized in my a siesta lon and you know what I'm just gonna say going through um overall okay this is you know right in the middle lower middle of the spectrum you can see that there's still a little oil left there cuz it got really harsh there at the bottom hard to draw from got a little hot I always found it a little bit hot both with with a different a couple different kind of batteries and on the why would burn hotter or whatever but it seemed to always just be a little bit hotter no real complaints with the taste other than that really harsh vape sort of cloud coming out of it and in terms of Highness it got you to that you know a place where you can get a little bit high but you're still like constantly constantly puffing on it just trying to get you know a little bit higher still you're just maintaining you know that three sort of level with with something like this at least for somebody who has a tolerance like me your mileage may definitely vary but I don't think this is the most potent cartridge on the market but for the price again I think I paid thirty five bucks for this for a whole gram which I haven't mentioned that I had some reservations that it was a whole gram and I still do I hadn't actually smoked a cartridge in a while and I wasn't puffing on this that much and it only lasted about three and a half days which seems a little short for as little as I was drawing on it I don't want to say that for sure I don't know that definitively there's really no real way to measure how much oil is actually in one of these you know because you don't know the cartridge noise so I have the cartridge not the cartridge noise excuse me the cartridge weight so you can't really put this on a scale to find out how much oil is in there sorry I got a couple iMessages right there that really disturb the flow um overall I thought it was really gonna hate this the top of it I still don't know whether it's ceramic or whether it's plastic but it never bothered me I handled the temperature quite fine never got hot never got weird tasting anything like that this is a perfectly fine material as a vape tip or at least it is to me who knows I might get cancer for a minute in five years I'm probably gonna get cancer from one of these things at some point not to be too much of a bummer but you know when you're on the cutting edge of whatever you know drug technology you're probably asking for some trouble Boyd this got dark that wasn't meant to get dark I'm just saying be careful out there kids so that is that for again magic pipe clear oil sativa Strawberry Cough one gram it says clear oil there I didn't just say that for no reason um and then guys before I totally bounce here for good Z's I want to share with you a little cherry on top something to be enjoyed with or without weed this time it definitely without weed kids you know definitely without that is come on man the scooters if you live in an urban area especially on the west coast or DC I'm sure there are more on the East Coast that I don't know about the scooter revolution is incredible I love it I do not understand the backlash to it I mean do I understand why there are people who are upset about it yes because people are will get upset about anything that has changed anything that is different but the scooter revolution is in just an altogether good people just need to get over the fact their scooters parked on the sidewalk because you know what their cars [ __ ] parked everywhere anyways just think of a scooter as like another kind of vehicle I don't know not to rant too much sort of goes with the mood I was in earlier doesn't it the real endorsement is if you live in an area that has the scooters and you haven't checked them out yet give it a shot it is a really interesting way to get around in urban space and one that I hope continues to proliferate here in Long Beach they seem to be a massive massive hit when you find them they're always we ran out of batteries because they've been used so much so I hope they can you explain here Long Beach I hope they continue to expand an urban regions [ __ ] the NIM beers who don't like any change or you know don't like things different than the way they had it when they grew up had to drive everywhere so scooters electric scooters I didn't mention that they're electric you don't have to pedal they're awesome you just Park him anywhere I didn't explain it at all scooters birdlime they're a million of them those are the two big ones check them out holy [ __ ] I've rambled a lot magic pipe scooters aah later guys thank you so much for watching wheats we'll see on the next review", "3rrc_cgSkwQ": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the news hopefully things will change but for now that looks like it's the way it's going to be thank you so much for watching waits and we will see you on a future video peace", "IGnvzAt-CZE": "[Music] marijuana's edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from bang one of my all-time favorites and we are looking at one of their hundred and twenty milligrams we are looking at the medical cannabis toffee chocolate honey toffee with smoked sea salt very excited about this one I've tried a few bang products in the past them and joined them all they all seem quite potent for the for the milligrams as listed I tried the 120 180 in 240 and I've been pleased with each of them so far and again this is another 120 and it is 200 excuse me 120 milligrams of THC the honey toffee with smoked sea salt so let's go ahead and cut into it here take a look give it a whiff alright so there you go so you can see on the front it's got its logo bang bang all that fun stuff some marijuana leaves and then on the back we've got our toffee smells good no wheat smell whatsoever break it off take a bite that is good mmm YUM as a fan of both toppy insulted dark chocolates this is delicious no we taste whatsoever perfect blend of chocolate and salt and that toffee is crunchy and crispy and sweet just on top of that very dark 70% dark chocolate delicious hmm I would just eat this point for sure roughly now friendos as we all know it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel so what the most important part is coming back in two hours and letting you guys know whether or not this 120 milligram and a boil I has got the juice like all the other bang products or not so I will see you guys in two hours to let you know if this is another worthy product from the bang line or if this is one to pass up but on taste I can tell you a plus all right guys I will see you in two hours thanks for watching [Music] it has been 2 hours guys welcome back to wheats boy bang has another winner on their hands with the perfection in cannabis convection their logo not mine but uh you know I gotta say it's uh pretty pretty pretty logo this is a great bar for a hundred and twenty milligram edible I am pretty [ __ ] high right now it tasted great others know we taste whatsoever the chocolate was delicious the toffee topping was crunchy crispy and just delicious oh my god um wonderful um maybe my favorite bang bar yet in terms of taste and I think it only cost me $8 at the dispensary and again for a an edible with only 120 milligrams of THC I mean that is an incredibly incredibly potent 120 milligrams so if you see this at the dispensary and you're a fan of toffee grab it you will not be disappointed it's got the wheat seal of approval alright guys and with that thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye bye and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "pvply1CNh9Q": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from cannabis quencher I know what you're thinking if you're a fan of my videos but wheats you're saying you've already reviewed the strawberry lemon-aid and that is correct but I've only reviewed the 200 milligram variety I have not yet reviewed the 100 milligram bretty in fact I've never reviewed any of the 100 milligrams from cannabis quenchers and the strawberry eliminated was my favorite flavors so far so I thought I'd give it a go if you've ever tuned in two weeks before guys the way our show works is I'm gonna take this edible or drinkable consume a bowl here finish it and come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling cuz that's the most important part of any edible review but without further ado let's open this up and give it a smell give it a taste see how it tastes and smells it's got a strong we do der just like the other cannabis quenchers but that's okay because the the taste isn't that bad if it's like the others I assume it should taste even better having less THC in it but let's find out [Music] and yes that is the case he's just like the other one except with a slightly less power potent wheat aftertaste which is great because the that's the worst part about this is the sort of lingering marijuana taste in your mouth is sort of oily weedy taste the initial taste is great it's just that aftertaste can linger a little bit but this is less potent than the 200 milligram variety in terms of that aftertaste so that's something look boy - it's good the gondolier said Strawberry Fields and cannabis fields equals are sweet and refreshing strawberry lemonade forever again don't know what the gondolier has to do with cannabis winter at all can't figure it out but I'm glad he's there to tell me all right guys well I am going to finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats chasm we'll see you soon peace guys half the price half the THC but not half the potency man I gotta say pleasantly surprised with the cannabis quenched your 100 milligrams I am pleasantly stoned for something that it's only advertised as half the strength as it's a hundred milligram brother and I don't feel half as high I feel you know not as high but but certainly not significantly less and the price is uh it so this is all this is I think it might dispensary half the price of the other one I think I would go with this one unless you really really really want to get knocked off your ass or if you have an incredibly high tolerance stick with the two hundred milligrams but I gotta say the hundred milligrams gonna do you the job probably and it's gonna do it at a more affordable price and I really really have enjoyed my reviews with abbis quite sure I will probably try some of their more exotic flavors just as an excuse to keep drinking them Wow yeah a plus um this gets uh well say an a because the the flavor isn't perfect and that's the first time I've ever given anything a letter grade before and probably the last time I ever do that so enjoy that and thank you cannabis quencher this was a great beverage and

any old lollipops though police say they were laced with marijuana and now that girl's mother is demanding answers news 8's Bob Wilson live for us in Hartford tonight with more Bob you know her mother is a drug and alcohol addiction counselor and so she knows what she's talking about she says you know it's a lollipop you've heard of pot laced brownies or cupcakes but lollipops she says she wants to get the word out there about what happened to her daughter they're very dangerous and they mess with their hearts and they hallucinate even knows what she's talking about her daughter became very sick at Enfield high school on Monday and ended up in the hospital her mom says she ate several candy Pops given to her by a friend they were laced with marijuana a bad batch of cannabis pops and she didn't know what she was eating because she's never been introduced to any drugs and she ate three of them and got a bad reaction to it and the toxicologists that a lot of kids are getting sick behind it this afternoon police detained a student at the high school for distributing the lollipops they have made their way through the high school and Eva is speaking out so other parents can warn their kids a lollipop is specifically for kids they're targeting kids yes and we're too close to Halloween so please be careful with these lollipops police say what makes this so dangerous is that the suspect they talked to the juvenile who admitted to having these lollipops had them flown in from California police say they say when it comes in from out-of-state especially like something like that that's untested you don't know what they're putting in it and it can be too much too little or something contaminated the FDA is not overseeing the the strength of this stuff the the cleanliness of this stuff so the puts this stuff in your mouth tonight you know it's just a really foolish thing to do tonight police are still investigating to see how many pops are still out there parents who have talked to their kids about drugs once before will have to do another talk about lollipops you just don't know what's out there you say don't accept candy from strangers don't say don't accept candy from your friend you know it's just very strange very scary for parents and the pot lace pollen lollipops in Enfield were green but we did find them on the Internet we did some digging in some research and found them they come in all colors they're for sale you can actually no order them over on online and police are saying it is illegal and they will follow up on it I'm Bob Wilson reporting live in Hartford news8", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please

slices of home otherwise known as home slices I don't know what that means that's a weird phrase I think but welcome home slices to wheats the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary we help you cut through all the [ __ ] and garbage that is out there in the edible world and the packaged goods edible world we help you cut through all that [ __ ] and find the best products the ones that are worth your hard-earned money today we have a product reviewing another hundred milligram cannabis syrup blackberry flavoured this time and I would say so far cannabis has definitely proven to be worth your hard-earned dollars but we'll see how this one fares the BlackBerry flavor also I curiously I know I pledged not to do this again but I tried a different variation maybe the fruity color combination and the fact that I think I had too little sprite in too much syrup precluded me from enjoying the sprite mix before however this time I went with the sprite cherry even though I swore it off last time said it still was gross because it was I had only a lot less sprite and I had double the amount of syrup mixed in so this time I have half the syrup and I'm gonna have more sprite and maybe that'll make it more palatable we'll find out so I went ahead and took off this annoying little packaging here alright thought I did okay yes there goes uh let's pour the sprite in first or cherry sprite I know black berry cherry sounds like a weird concoction but uh you know might be good we'll give it a try alright cherry blackberry it this sounds like a coke freestyle machine right here sprite cherry blackberry soda all right I got my sprite in dumping the blackberry stuff in it looks very purple um looks like cough syrup I mean of course it does um nothing can be worse than the taste of that yeah I can be I can be comforted in the fact that I know nothing will be worse than the chocolate syrup I took straight and let me get something to mix this with actually I'll be right back who cares Yolo alright let's see how this sumbitch tastes this is cherry sprite mixed with blackberry cannabis 100 milligrams well that is significantly better still not good necessarily you can still taste it in the aftertaste thing this sort of heavy sort of cannabis in that thick syrup sort of taste but it is significantly better than the first time around yeah significantly better and the flavors match pretty well cherry blackberry who would have thunk alright guys well I will I'm gonna drink the rest of this over the next couple of minutes and then I will see you in two hours but you will just see me well I should I won't ever see you presumably you'll see me in just a couple of seconds but I will be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review alright guys I will see you then peace [Music] whoo-ahh guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis syrup a blackberry and I am pleasantly high maybe six and a half maybe a six somewhere in there my tolerance is still a little bit lowered but I I would I would definitely recommend it it's another winner from cannabis cost me eight bucks normally ten dollars again at a discount so it's pretty affordable you know right in line with a know normally costing one hundred milligram edibles and as you can see my slurred speech I am actually pretty high and I thought the sprite cherry sprite and Blackberry combination worked pretty well it definitely definitely helped that I had a better ratio of sprite to a better proportion of sprite to to syrup in the cup that certainly improved improved it I wasn't necessarily just the cherry flavor but yeah another easy recommendation for cannabis the blackberry flavor man you know it is what it is it's not not my favorite I think that would go too well actually no that's the blackberry with the cherry is the best way I've experienced it it was the best flavor so it is my favorite what was I talking about yeah I liked it that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching it as always and if you see cannabis at the dispensary nearest you and you're not afraid of a thick thick syrup you know something a little different go for it go for it thanks for watching weeds guys we'll check you out in the next review

from Kiva's and their tare outline so this is the second product we've reviewed there Tara espresso beans chocolate-covered espresso beans this is their milk chocolate covered blueberries I loved the espresso beans I thought they were an amazing edible I was way higher than I thought I'd be for 120 milligram and I was pretty wired seeing as they were as preso beans and they tasted great way better than I thought they were gonna taste so I've got high high hopes no pun intended for the Tara blueberries let's open them up give them a taste and if this is the first time you've ever tuned in to a week's review the way our reviews worked is I'm gonna eat these blueberries some number of them at least the whole thing over the next couple of minutes I rest assured and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how all these blueberries are feeling so let's go ahead and dig in you can see the blueberry they're nice and chocolate-covered hmm no we taste men those are wonderful let me show you the container there guys and they taste great oh my god I'm not even a huge blueberry pen and I love these these are just as good as the espresso beans I can't pick a favorite right now but maybe after the end of two hours I will have a favorite for sure as of right now love them both so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know how these tear a hundred and twenty milligram bytes are working from Kiba see you then thanks for watching peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys and a huge congratulations to Kiva for their Terra 120 milligrams blueberries because holy [ __ ] these things are just as good as the espresso beans these things all killer no filler as some 41 would say I think that's the name I think that was who said that all killer no filler these are great just like there's espresso beans these things hit with the potency of an edible twice they're milligram midge oh boy I am high and I gotta say they taste great they'll get you high becoming a groovy package and they're not that expensive I believe these were $12 so you know not that much I'm so well I guess relative to 112 milligrams 120 milligrams milligrams milligrams milligrams boy Wow I forgot what I was trying to say what I'm trying to tell you is you're gonna like these if you pick these up there may not be the cheapest hundred and twenty milligram edible that's what I was trying to get out of earlier but they are damn good heartily recommend them boy I do they're good so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I would throw this at the camera but then I'd break it and then that would be sad so I'm not gonna do that but I am gonna tell you I'm kind of like George Michael from Arrested Development when things go astray I just kind of turn my

at the final Kiva product I think we have reviewed them all now unfortunately as sad as that might be this is the key 180 milligram bar the blackberry dark chocolate flavor super super excited about it every Kiva product I've done from their chocolate buyers to their Terra's their chocolate covered blueberries or espresso beans haven't blown me away every time both in tastes in terms of potency so I'm very very excited for this I believe this cost me $50 at the dispensary but with the discount it was probably closer to 12 or 13 dollars so pretty affordable 480 milligrams well not the cheapest in the world but but you definitely get what you pay for here so let's go ahead and open it up and while I open it up I'll explain the way our reviews work in case you've never tuned in before where reviews work is on the eat this candy bar may be all that in front of you maybe not depending how long it takes but I will eat the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so you can see there keep it right down into these four forty five milligram bars this fancy packaging and the double layer here and most fun this was actually made on 420 of fortuitous so let's go and open it up and try this kiva 180 milligram black berry dark chocolate bar if I can get it open technical difficulties stand by got it I thought I did I did it I open the package guys go me so there we are one of our 45 milligrams rectangles there got a little pot leaf on it mmm and that is delicious love it well another winner in terms of keep taste from Cuba but for how it's gonna make me feel guys that's gonna take two hours or actually a little bit longer than two hours because I'm about to go see spider-man homecoming right behind us here so I will see you right up from the movie to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching guys and I will see you in about two-and-a-half hours peace [Music] hi guys welcome back to mates it's been something like almost three hours since I last checked in with you since I had meet Kiva a hundred and eighty milligram blackberry dark chocolate and I am still feeling quite high three hours later loved it tasted great feeling super high I mean I outrageously high but very high for a hundred 80 milligram edible can recommend this Kiva just like into the others no problem all the key 180 milligram lines are great just go ahead and grab whatever flavor seems best for you I like the mint Irish cream and the dark chocolate tangerine the best but they're all incredible and they'll all get you [ __ ] up so this is a easy easy recommendation for me the key 180 milligram blackberry dark chocolate also spider-man homecoming it was a lot more fun than I thought it was gonna be so go see that too if you haven't seen it yet but I'm probably gonna be posting this like a month from now I'm
