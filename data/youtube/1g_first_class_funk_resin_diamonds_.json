{"vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better

cures what's good doing a west coast we tour review featuring the buddies brand forbidden skittles liquid diamond live resin one gram baked cartridge i'm excited we've got a buddy's brand vape battery it's going to be an exciting time now the cool thing about this particular west coast we tour review is that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring i tried to bring some the buddies maybe maybe throw some more info on there it doesn't hurt people want to know i want to know you know what's up with this strain and that's about it other than the terps you guys are hitting on t nine club well very much appreciate the honesty man and the transparency on what you're looking for thank you this is jay ping here man respect my region and buddies

earlier before there's two huh even like a seven gram joint anna blantee pulled up with the blunt how did it taste it didn't taste like purpley did it taste purple um it tasted more on the turkey side for me yeah for sure oh it's sour diesel my bad yeah you're expecting like a grape type flavor yeah i really was i'm like damn but it wasn't bad i think you'll get a flavor dude you're like i'm getting all the wreaths for sure i'd be doing the same [ __ ] can't waste wax it's too good to be wasted you know we're gonna start unopening this up so we're not just looking at edmond and just staring at me he's all getting high by himself cheers guys i was telling them that this cartridge reminds me of that um push-up candy for real flo says she's going to attempt to 20 seconds she's like

whatever i guess we got a pretzel but like we didn't even finish like a snack you know yeah like a little pre breakfast oh that scene has a 20 second blinker that's insane that's crazy that is insane i've actually attempted it it's not fun to do this more like uh i gotta take out the camera and do it here and then it's not like i would do it every day yeah and we were just talking about it like you don't do a blinker honestly every single time you have the chance like more of a challenge type of [ __ ] yo this thing's getting high for sure though i think we haven't smoked in a while the cartridge i feel like it tastes like a dab yeah that's just like really dab like uh-huh it has like i thought it was gonna be fruity some type of foodie but for sure it gives me like more terpenes yeah concentrate um vibes like a dab you know you're smoking like some strong [ __ ] for sure just based off the flavor yeah you can take another dab pack it up yeah they're gonna be back to back that

let us know what's your favorite candle maybe we go might go purchase that one or whatever and until next time peace out", "AZMrC0TjKdA": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] alright guys back here for no [ __ ] video we out here got the bong ready to go your honor you know it is but today guys there's gonna be a short little vlog a little informative bug about fake [ __ ] carts guys because there's been a lot of fake ass carts going around and I don't want you guys to get cheated you feel me I want you guys to I want you guys to be able to smoke realize cars guys like I'm tired of people selling fake ass cars and it's just disrespectful guys so like today I found a guy who sells fake for all garden carts and I have a real raw garden this is a real rug or in the place that I got it from is verified I'll probably show you guys later that is verified just to prove you guys that it's [ __ ] verified and I don't know we don't get these fake cards off the street now we can't get the fake cars off the street but I can tell you guys how to tell the difference between a fake and a real [Music] as people have been selling fake cards for too long guys it started off with the brass knuckles and the dang cars and the mario cards like wind-up mario nigut if you smoke something called mario [ __ ] you stupid but um I hit him up this dumb just so dude that sells like treating cars on the street I hit him love and he's gonna come through real quick and when he gets here I'm going to show you guys what the [ __ ] the difference is but before that let me take a bong rip you guys already freaking know you know I'd be on my bong way of life all right I'm gonna get back to you guys in a few minutes I'm just waiting for him to pull up and we all will get these things all right before I um talk to him real quick he's about to come in in a few minutes I just want to show you that I got it from a place that's verified if it has the check mark and we maps that shit's verify so all these are verified and the one that I bought the other day I did a vlog on it you guys want to check it out with the link in the description it is a chocolate slurm alright guys I'm finally back and this is how you could tell the fake from the real pro so I got the dojo Kush I actually spend money on it and then I got the cherry slurm I couldn't find the chocolates learn that I had but I had cherries learn before and I know it's verified so I got that this is the rowan and this is the fake the first difference I'm gonna show you guys is you know the difference in the boxes the boxes are totally different I looked at that [ __ ] I knew was fake but I needed a box to get it so I said [ __ ] it take one for team but check yourself so this is Rowan and this is fake as you can see the font and the color are totally different see the fake one is more light green light green around while the real one is dark green start reading around and you can see the font is different too by the net weight and cartridge you can see that the font are way different see by the fonts on the date and of the other other information on here that's how you can see that's the first way you guys can tell a fake from a real so the other way is by actually looking at the cart actually I have to open it real quick give me a second guys so now the second difference is there's no see a caution on the card up see how the real one this is the real one you see how the real one has the CA on it that one didn't have it and then you can also tell by the color that's the third thing you could do is hell is by the color but honestly the color on these look super similar so I don't know but usually you can tell by the color guys and then you guys already know the last way is to like actually taste test the product but I already know it's fake but for you guys I'm gonna do it for the one time for you guys the wu-tang alright guys do not I'm just gonna tell you guys do not buy [ __ ] carts off the street like I already knew it was kind of bad when he told me that the cart was $45 that's a that's a signal that's a signal all in itself right there $45 boy that [ __ ] is 65 but I was just going with it I'm not I don't care I just needed a car either way you feel me but um it's 65 guys or more for these cars they're expensive and that's why they taste so good this [ __ ] tastes like a [ __ ] battery guys like it doesn't taste good at all it has no type of essence from the flower nothing like it might look similar this [ __ ] really gave me one with a fat bubble engine bro I just got screwed but um it's fake guys like I don't know let me taste this one [Music] see I wish you guys could taste this so you guys could tell this is that real raw garden [ __ ] like [ __ ] this fake [ __ ] but like those are the ways that you guys can tell guys I hope everyone's having a good day I just wanted to do a short little vlog for you guys because I just wanted to post more so I just decided to do something about karts because I don't know I feel like not too many people are doing the karts are they're not showing you the real fake ones like that are actually out there so I bought one I was like man let me show you guys like what the real fake ones look like let me just show you guys so I got one and I'm probably gonna throw it in the trash matter of fact just take this [ __ ] this is what you do with fake cards you take the fake cart and guys okay go to the trash can and you see the cigarette butts you throw it in with the cigarette butts so I hope everyone liked this vlog don't forget to Like comment subscribe and don't [ __ ] smoke fake cards make sure you go to a dispensary or get you got to get it from some reputable place make sure they're verified it's not worth your health you know what I mean so just get a verified one pretty much all you have to do is not buy off the street but [Music]", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

is packed with lots of tips and tricks that I use to get a really nice-looking project let's get this project started welcome back to moon cluster art it's Janet and I'm gonna do some coasters today I'm using liquid diamonds and this is a two to one ratio so this is part a so I'm going to use two parts of Part A and one part of Part B and I'm going to be doing this in layers so we're gonna start out by just pouring a clear layer into these molds and let's do that now I backed up my liquid diamonds and it is amazingly clear crystal clear it's in a white Cup and hopefully you guys can see just how clear it is there are barely any bubbles just itty bitty tiny ones so this is wonderful resin for using when you're looking to do a casting and that's kind of where I'm going with this so again this is just it's only three ounces that I batched up and I'm gonna split back between each one of these and again what I'm trying to do here is I'm just pouring enough to coat the bottoms I'll do the bottom now they're going to turn out to be the top but I'm just pouring out enough that I can use that as my first layer pouring here and because I'm going to be adding some product in here so what I want to do is I want to create a layer rather a surface for the project so let's just get that get up in the cups here and these molds I got off of Amazon I think I found in like a shop that sells baking supplies I guess these are used for making tarts baking tarts so they can withstand some heat but they can't withstand a lot of heat so you have to be careful I already see that I had a hair in there get that out and I have them on this tray here so without having to use a popsicle stick or anything like that I can just manipulate the tray and get the bottoms coated just like that so easy that works alright and I'm gonna let those sit and we'll come back and add the next layer I forgot I'm just gonna pop the bubbles real quick with this a little later but you got to be careful you don't want to hold it up you don't want to get the edges of these molds hot so just a real quick hit with the later pops the bubbles out and I'm going to put a cover and let them start to thicken up 24 hours later and I patched up ounce and a half of liquid diamonds and I'm just gonna put it by the way these are cured I don't want to move them but they're all cured I had I left my cup that I had mixed it in before sitting off to the side so I could check to make sure that the resident was cured but I it's you know 24 hours and I'm gonna just pour a thin coat of clear [Music] so now what my plan is is I'm going to take these little paper flowers and I'm gonna drop them in now remember you know the bottom is going to become my top so I'm gonna put them in upside down and this is why I did that first layer and let it cure I've never used these in resin before and I can already see that the paper is kind of absorbing the resin and okay yep this is how we learn so it's going to change its color a little bit [Music] all right so yeah they're paper flowers and you know made sense to me ahead of time I figured that it's paper so they're gonna absorb their resin and yeah it's the liquid diamonds which is very thin so it's good actually because it's going to keep it from releasing any bubbles so but it's going to keep them anchored to that first clear layer that I poured which is exactly what I want so that's gonna sit now and and we'll check tomorrow I have patched up some more of the liquid diamonds really really just like water see how it just like you know pours right off then but that's why it doesn't hold the bubbles because it's so thin and that's great when you're trying to do casting so I already tinted some small amounts this is a metallic turquoise and this is a turquoise color yeah I'm going to start off by pouring in the clear now because it's so thin it's really not going to stay where I pour it it's gonna wanna you know spread out so my thought is two or a little bit that and then I used these paper cups because they're nice they allow me to pinch the top and then I can have a little four spout and I'm going to pour that in here and then the same thing with the metallic turquoise pinch the cup and have a little bit [Music] you the poor is deep enough now that everything is covered the bottom is smooth and I'm just gonna again use my little handy dandy flame here and just make sure the bubbles are out quick little thing there like that doesn't take much and you can see that I left areas of clear and you know I I can see I'm not sure if you guys can see here on the camera that I can see that there's some depth so just like when you do a petri dish pour with alcohol inks and resin this also has weight to it and some is going to sink more some is going to stay at the surface so it's going to have that look to it also but I wanted to also allow it to have clear areas now yeah hey we'll see what it looks like okay but I'm happy with it from here and we're gonna check it out tomorrow see you then check out these molds and see how we did pop one off of there and I'm just gonna carefully roll it out of the mold it's like that all right so that's the view from the top and let's flip and there it is and if we look in through the side there's a little bit of that look that you get you can definitely see where I had poured the first layer and there they are all right so that's one [Music] you can see the details a little better over a white background little that little mark right there in the highlight from the light that is from the mold itself it's an imperfection in the mold it's not from the resin so when you guys order molds from Amazon and it's supposed to be a shiny surface make sure that you inspect those molds with really good eyes because this wasn't got by me I had ordered other ones and sent them back because of ink imperfections and that one slipped past me they have from the mold they have that little lip edge because it's sitting in the mold this way right so it kind of pulls so the edge of the mold and it creates that lip edge so I'm going to sand that off because I don't want that to be on my finished product and I want to do that before I clear coat because once I clear coat I don't want to be sanding so I saw this on a video and I thought this was a pretty good trick if you lay your sandpaper down on a flat surface then you get a nice even and flat sanding job so I'm working on a little bit of an angle because I don't want to scuff up the bottom of my coaster and I'm just taking a little bit of pressure and dragging it this is uh what is this this is 224 fine finishes so I don't know if you guys can see it yet but I'm getting some you know sanding a residue there so I'm just you know gonna work that edge until I get it down to the point where I feel like it's not a sharp lip edge you know carefully working [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you're right oh you can see the dust from the resin there I'm just gonna take a this is just a clean dry towel I'll just get remove that dust and now I'll show you edge so you can see it's just you know real small and that way it keeps the finish on the bottom what's going what's going to be the bottom it's gonna keep that nice and bright and shiny and I'm gonna be taping off the bottom so that when I clear coat I get a real nice result see so now these have been cleaned there's no dust on them it's nice and shiny and I'm gonna tape off the back so that I can do the top coat and I'm gonna show you how I do that I do not want to put the tape on the sides because I want the resin to flow past the tape and you guys know I have a love affair going on with edge lock tape it's my favorite tape you know there's probably other tapes out there that you know people use for their resin but me I'm in love with the edge lock tape what can I say all right so I'm just applying this across the entire surface on the back now that might seem a little bit wasteful but there would be nothing worse in my mind than to have got got I don't think that's correct English there would be nothing worse in my opinion then to have a finger print of resin or a wild drip of resin show up on the back of my piece so you can see that this is covering except for one little sliver oops okay that's the end of that roll don't worry I've got more so I also you know this one is doesn't tell me on here but it looks like it's about inch and a half and this one looks to be maybe three quarters of an inch to an inch so filling in the gap right and make sure it's nice and tight go around its my edge of my sharpie marker and then I'm gonna take my razor blade and being careful that I don't hurt myself I'm just gonna use that too trim my tape right around the edge of my coaster right so you can see BB C is right even with the edge of my coaster so I'm just going to keep going around and doing that and get these all squared up but that's how I keep the backs protected and it's all thicker there because it's again it's doubled up all right you can do it this way too I've done it this way also where I lay it down and then I just take my razor blade and keeping it up against the edge of my coaster this is at one of those self-healing mats and you can just cut straight down I'll remove the excess that goes a little bit quicker alright so let me get these prepped up and we'll get ready to clearcoat alright I have my coasters set up on my little yogurt cup pedestals and the bottoms are taped off that's why they look a little different to you because you're seeing the blue of the tapes right through the coaster and this is countertop epoxy this is their FX poxy and how you can see it's full of bubbles and that's okay it's not going to bother me here because normally you know if I'm using this to do whatever I'm gonna torch and get those bubbles but I I wanted to hopefully this can see them all in there I know it's hard but anyway there's a lot of bubbles lots of bubbles so this is not a good choice if you're wanting to do like what I did this would be considered a casting it's about a half inch thick and bubbles get trapped in there so that's why using liquid diamonds for a project like this is great because there's no bubbles you guys might see what looks like bubbles but that's from that metallic pigment that I used and that's what those little flecks are in there it's actually the metallic so I'm going to apply this to the top of each of these and the resin can run right by it because I trimmed that tape close and when I pull the tape off it should be a nice edge on the bottom [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right I guess you guys can't really see anything so just get a look in this angle is a giant plastic container storage container and they work great to keep dust off of your projects and these are all cured really nice glass finish on that so let's just pop them off and I put this tape here on the back let's see just how easily it comes off that one came off easy and I expected it to let's see how my edges are just a little hanging on there so far don't even need to use my heat gun if I had a stubborn piece of tape I would use my heat gun but that's beautiful it's important to remove your tape I like to do it within 24 hours if I'm doing a piece of artwork painting or something and doing multiple layers well then you can't get away from it but I try to do the work as quickly as possible so check it out oh that's cute it's fantastic job all right let's finish removing the tape at spots the tape got a little bit stuck to those sanded edges I set up my heat gun it can stand just like this on my table top and then all I have to do is wave the piece over top of the hot air that's blowing out it warms it up just a little bit makes the resin a little softer and I'm able to pull that tape right off alright one last thing I do to finish off my coasters anything looks so good there is I like to use these or cabinet bumpers they call them and they have an adhesive back to them so you just pop those off of there and then I try to plan out where I'm gonna place them because I like to hide them as best I can underneath what's going on and I always put 4 on because that makes the coaster stable so pretty much I'm what I'm gonna do is I'll place them in a north-south east-west position just like that and there they are so now when I set them down right super somebody's gonna put their glass down on top of that and it's not gonna go anywhere so I'm gonna wrap this up for you guys I don't put the rest of those on all right so the coaster project is done and my resin that I used is the liquid diamonds the liquid diamonds is very water like this is the part partnered the beat and you can just see how it moves around in there just like water same thing for the Part A which is usually going to be a thicker component but when you mix them together it's a very water lake very minimal bubbles I did take my time combining them to try to minimize the amount of bubbles that I introduced to the resin but the bubbles that were in there were quickly coming up to the surface so that worked great this was done in layers and as you know from watching the video and I did surface them with countertop epoxy which is one of my favorite ones to use it has a heat rating of 500 degrees and that works really nicely in a coaster application because I want it to be resistant to the heat of let's say a coffee mug or a tea mug or something like that so that worked great these little paper flowers that I picked up at Hobby Lobby they were really cute I had fun working with those I like the way they sit in the resin molds and you can see very clearly how much they changed in their color in the resin but that's okay they they stayed pretty much it as a brown which is what I was expecting and of course the pigments that I used in there I'm really pleased with how they look so anyway I hope you learn something from my project and oh they got their little silicon feet on the back there yeah there you go so anyway if you are interested in

Vince got the fancy iPhone again to take some close-up shots so let's see what this stuff looks like here's the box we got seventy seven point six seven percent THC and the packaging just looks really awesome I love these boxes and I love all the graphics on them the box from last week looks awesome that's last week's review don't forget to check that out I even got this Vince key dad now well it's really like a mousepad but I'm using it as a dad mat right now I really love their branding I really love their hash - let's see what this stuff looks like whoo Oh God look at this I mean it's it's so wet and it's like poured up the side a little bit you see that there's a nice mix of diamonds and sauce look at this that's sort of a bummer I got some stuff to the lid but that's okay we'll get it later oh this stuff has such a deep musky scent oh oh I don't know what that smells like but it smells so good it smells like um definitely like an indica like a cushy Diesel II earthy type of oh I wish you could smell this oh god it smells so good alright I know it's smelling let's do some Davin let's see how much of this wet stuff we can balance on here while we heat up the banger and get all this off the side might as well get that chunky crystal straight diamonds how wet it is oh the terms dude I mean that looks like a pretty dangerous amount that dab really wants to drip off with that so bad please don't little buddy please we'll just make it oh my god it's barely hanging up okay maybe I can set up the camera phone the camera phone will heat up your dad at the same time okay okay

yes I want one of your best hashed filming phones please all right here we go buddy it's a lot okay strange Oh [Music] they're nice that was a smooth smooth dab so super smooth and it tasted exactly like it smells unless we need to put a word to this smell it's a I mean what would I call this taste alone I don't have a word for it yet I'm gonna hit another down and we're gonna decide the taste but it tastes like a very indica dominant earthy pungent musky a robust it tastes like Mother Nature's tittie nipple if you sucked on it well you gotta figure out some better descriptive terms than that we need to hit another dab the store still sucks but I raised the phone camera so we don't got to do this awkward bending over on the counter I hit a dab stuff cuz that was mad weird I don't know if you've seen the weirdness in it but I felt it I felt the weird and it wasn't the kind of weird I like to feel gonna see Jade cicada tonight you don't know Jade cicada I will leave a link to his music you need to check that out too gelato cake live diamonds and sauce strange oh yeah just going hidden over and over and over again it's never-ending dab stopper whoa I think mother nature's tittie nipple think I still like that because there's so many earthy elements that I could use to describe this super weird super good never tasted any anything that isn't a weed product that tastes anything like this like the world don't taste like this unless you're smoking weed but if you lived your whole life and never spoke no dank weed and then you just walked into a dispensary and got blooming SuperDuper gumdrop gelato cake and all these fruity exotic strains you're gonna start tasting things you've never tasted in your whole life like that yeah that's what this what we taste like okay Oh weed if you know someone that doesn't smoke weed serving this videos and tell them show them you see his excitement do you see how excited because of how these dabs taste live resin man live resin is pretty much like a whole a live weed plant if you don't know how they make live resin I got a little video about that it's pretty interesting stuff but all right that's the - dabs in we're gonna piece it out for 20 minutes and I'll be right back to let you know how the high from this stuff is so it's been about 23 minutes I feel good in stone after I hit those dabs I had this head that heavy chest feeling I had that for probably half the time I've been gone for the whole 10 minutes still feeling like I might cough I mean this stuff although it hits real smooth it's like it reaches in and grabs you and just remember on Game of Thrones or that giant crush that little girl oh that's what this did to me for ten minutes but in the best way possible that it could do that I wouldn't matter at all I wasn't in pain I know it wasn't not enjoying myself but I was just like felt like I was gonna bust a little drop a sweat Vince Clive revs and diamonds and sauce it's a lot okay I'm gonna give this like a nine point five out of ten very good if you remember I only paid two dollars for both of these we're not even gonna judge on price because the price was awesome yeah check out

concentrate and i love how most of it has these crazy huge diamonds in it that looks so sick but what is it i'm about to tell you what these diamonds are how they get there and why they're only in live resin right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed these chunks in live resin sometimes called live diamonds or diamonds and sauce are just straight up chunks of thc and the runny part are the sauce is a collection of mad terpenes and cannabinoids and this is why i love live resin so much i even made some live resin gear for the strange show shop just so i would have a sick hoodie to wear i mean live resin is just the perfect combination of the runny smelly terpenes i want plus a bunch of chunks of thc that sounds perfect to me speaking of me my name's matt this is the strain show and this is the channel where i answer all the questions you ever had about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain branch so almost all weed concentrates except for things like cbd extracts have thc in them but you usually only see these diamonds in live resin and not even all live resin has these diamonds so what's going on here what's the difference why are these thc diamonds only in live resin and how do these diamonds even form in the first place well that all has to do with how live resin is made with most weed concentrates all of the weed that you use has been dried first like all of the weed i hung in this humongous drying room but with live resin the weed that is used is cut down quickly stripped of all its fan leaves and frozen as quickly as possible like in these big bags of frozen weed i have right here when the weed is quickly frozen instead of being allowed to dry it retains almost all of the terpenes and cannabinoids of the living weed plant hence the name live resin the terpenes that give your weed all of its smell and that give your hash all of its flavor are liquids and when you dry the wheat out you lose most of your terpenes and most of your flavor but with live resin you keep all of that but that only tells us why live resin tastes so good but what does that have to do with these diamonds forming well i was wondering the same thing and luckily i have friends in very high places so i reached out to some friends over at viola extracts here in denver where they make awesome concentrates and they're always pushing out some fire live resin and i ask them for an expert's explanation of how all these extra terps and stuff make these thc diamonds form in something like live resin but they don't form in something like shatter and here's what they told me the crystalline formations are dictated by the volatility of the source material the more volatile the source material like fresh frozen weed will produce a more dynamic chemical reaction under purge resulting in the separation and formation of crystalline structures a less volatile source product like dried weed produces less of a dynamic reaction and stabilizes before attaining crystalline structures thus the solid homogenous structure of shatter so basically the oil that is extracted from these live plants starts off without these diamonds in it but this oil is made up of so many different compounds that there are all kinds of different chemical reactions going on between different parts of the plant while all this is going on and the extraction solvents are being purged off tiny crystalline structures of thc begin to form and sink and eventually they stick together and form these huge thc diamonds and sometimes they grow huge like this monster here in the oils extracted from dried weed there aren't as many components or chemical reactions and the thc never separates and forms these crystalline structures and that's why shatter is just hard and dry it was made from dried weed that has way less terpenes in cannabinoids to cause those chemical reactions and crystalline formations and now that i know all about what these thc diamonds are i'm about to go right here and hit some fat slow-mo dabs of these guys and that's the video i think you should watch right now this is the video that youtube thinks you should watch right now so i don't know you tell me but yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got these nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange show it's like going to weed college", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600 likes all right i know we could hit over 600 likes easily you guys do it all the time man when i don't ask you guys to smash that like button you guys are over here hitting 400 500 likes so i know this one time that your boy asked you for a like we could run it up to over 600 right boys and once we get that i'm gonna go ahead and go out and cop my favorite cartridges of 2020 put you guys on game all right boys so with that being said let's go ahead and narrow this down buddy's cartridge fire um you know i'm sad that it kind of took me so long to hop on this buddy's wave you know i was just stuck on raw garden so bad but um that i just really didn't want to pay attention to this but now that you know this i know this is not distillate i know this is some fire i'm going to be definitely copying these a lot more copying the earth is a lot more i want to try a 710 um pod again uh tier one possibly and just see how how that gets me i could already like imagine dude just how fire that one would be right so 600 likes we'll get that cracking buddies super fire i love this strain legend og watermelon skittles even though the tc percentage isn't too high it still does what it needs to do the full spectrum high is on point and the flavor is fire too it's not the best tasting i'm not gonna say it's like crazy insanely good tasting it's live resin so but um for this one in particular it does taste pretty decent you know um and with that being said guys this [ __ ] is fire eight out of ten for me if it had a little bit more higher tc percentage you know that that would be the nine out of ten for me so um yeah we're ending out the video here if you guys enjoyed today's man video do me one last favor let's smash that like button let's get over 600 likes comment i try

guys have been supporting me my twitch streams my um you know my second channel following that and i appreciate you guys so much that really means a lot to your boy and last but not least man don't forget if you haven't already smash that subscribe button let's try to reach over 50k subs by the end of the year alright boys i love you i appreciate every single one of you that watched my video today and i hope you guys have a blessed weekend cheers", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "btmtiPSjK5Y": "what's up guys today i got a vape cartridge from buddies this is a mix between wedding cake and watermelon skittles comes up to 73.6 percent this is a indica i could have sworn i got a hybrid but i guess i was wrong so we got it set up right here got the buddy's battery ready to go so let's try it out cheers i've tried doing multiple videos with this but this indigo just puts me to sleep so obviously there's no flavor it's more of a live resin type of raw garden taste which we all know well some of us let's take another hit this is obviously a c cell battery it rips so this thing rips fat it's very smooth too the taste is it's not bad for an indica doesn't taste that heavy so pretty good product like liquid diamonds live resin so i've been trying to finish this for a few weeks now i've been kind of switching between actual bud and and different cartridges so cheers [Music] all right last hit

don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video I actually have a concentrate review for you guys so shout out drip right here at the brand rip they have some [ __ ] fire wax um I did some uh views on them in the past but mine did I picked up the diamond [ __ ] this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire I haven't smoked this yet um dad a buy one get one deal Oh am I so originally I wasn't planning on making this reviewing video for this sided [ __ ] you why not I haven't done review videos in a while so I heard he smoked the other grand that I had it was a different strain than this one so I don't know I should have did a review on that but I didn't know this shit's [ __ ] fired now I smoked one grandmother diamond to you I'm excited to try this his this [ __ ] I don't know if I should look stupid fire like let me show you guys some close-ups in a minute and that's gonna be the judge of that but um the shout out drip like I said bro that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire so let's put them those close-ups and then I'm get into this review so all right so yeah let's just go over the packaging real quick and then open this up we'll get this smoking on it or I'll get the spoken on it I guess I wish you guys could smoke with me but and then I'll get to reviewing it after that you know what I mean so I hope you guys are smoking along but for the top of the box comes in this little box this is a little sticker that the dispensary throws on but just says I dripped one gram sauce diamond nothing really too important on that sticker and I mean so the box I really liked it um the logo drift it's like you can flip it upside down and it's like the same and that I'm saying and it has a color of gold I feel what you call that [ __ ] shiny letters I'm saying I had like all the box so [ __ ] fire he was like there are social medias if you want to check them out I doubt you again so I I just see reviewing that papaya no it's that wrong I'm pretty sure I don't know something like that so yeah papaya um leave us an indica so that's the box their presentation is fire you open it up you're greeted with this say I don't know I think this [ __ ] the packaging is like fire that [ __ ] looks dope police in my opinion I know you guys think down below you guys are getting the close-up shots but let me show you guys just again real quick cuz this [ __ ] is [ __ ] it's like white brother like that shit's crazy I don't know I'm excited to smoke on this one I want the key my really before it but they made this video but I didn't have any alcohol off it's a little bit dirty but this is what I'm smoking in all of this is over Cyclopes and crazy foot gets the job done we're gonna do a little taste test we're going to a high test and then I guess just like a smoke test the packaging I can give that a rating right now I'll get the packaging probably about like a 4.5 out of 5 patacoins [ __ ] fire it's nothing not like too complicated it gets the job done but it's like [ __ ] crazy it's dope you know and I mean they all give a like a 4.5 on the packaging and then I'm so we're gonna do a taste test a smoke test the way so it's probably gonna smoke crazy you know I mean the smoke test I usually like do like how how well it like blows clouds the only me if it smokes properly and [ __ ] I'm going into a high test a price point so this [ __ ] was $60 a grand actually but it was a buy one get one free so I didn't technically paid like 30 a gram but 60 dollars a gram if they don't have that deal going and then we're gonna do like a overall review it's like all those things like overall review thing that I'm saying so let's just hop into this I've been talking a little bit too long so I've been talking a little bit too much so let's just hop into this so yeah I drift diamonds [ __ ] on fire last look at it and I'm gonna get like a not a huge dap so we're talking both my carb cap the other day so I got to use this as a carb cap but it gets the job done so I'm what I was saying though I'm not gonna get the biggest tab right here and I guess what the older taste as first I'm gonna get get a close-up shot of me getting this wax and the dabber in a second like look at this [ __ ] the camera doesn't want to focus on it too well with that [ __ ] as though they're like almost [ __ ] white bro that's crazy yeah I'm gonna take this little that's actually a pretty fat dad but this is gonna be put a little taste test real quick so I don't know that [ __ ] looks crazy I can't get over the looks of this I can't get over the way this looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] crazy like I said I hope you guys are smoking along hope you guys are smoking something banking if you are and [Music] and also I don't know if you guys in my last review I did a northern might should be on these duchies I also had these what is this this is a purple dream if you guys want to see a review on these cannabis cigarettes let me know down below in the comments oh yeah so the papaya diamond life not libraries and um paya diamonds so kind of hop into this so we've done a little pace that's now so like I said that shit's [ __ ] so5 um so right off the bat there's not too much [ __ ] flavor it just tastes super [ __ ] clean like that's really all I'm getting right off the bat I'm not too familiar with this Drano so let me look up this strain on leafy and see what this drain sports the tastes like and I'll write in kind of um say if it did or not you know I mean but now that she was super smooth like you seen how that [ __ ] was hidden that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] ripped um barely I didn't even off you know I mean that shit's super clean super smooth so syndicate strain like I said cross with critical number thirteen with ice to to make their own fruit and not their own this is what the taste is similar to its tropical fruit counterpart but a spicy peppery side also becomes apparent that's what I was gonna say actually on I was gonna say it tasted a little bit sweetie like a little bit sweetie it's a little sweet I'm gonna taste super slick that doesn't have like that indica skunky like pungent paste what I mean that you'd normally get with in the goods as I go sweet like fire like clean paste that like super super fire I didn't really get that peppery side just like kind of like sweet tropical foods like I said definitely [ __ ] [ __ ] fire bro look let me get a close-up shot of me getting a DAB on I brought avert so setting that you [Music] alright so that was kinda hard to do with one hand like what the phone wasn't handing it to have another name of the fabric but you guys seem that [ __ ] it's like super crystal e the color brother that looks at this [ __ ] looks 5 out of 5 this shit's [ __ ] fired someone take a bigger dad now not the biggest but I don't want to smoke up all my wife's right now so we're gonna do a little bit of pretty big though so we're going to pick the high PES now I guess so let me take this pad - yeah how smokes and then get the higher rate [Music] another Shih Tzu just won't be like some of the best class I've ever had I mean my opinion I don't know like that at least took the best wives I've had in a minute that I can remember you know I mean but this shit's fire so um yeah we've got a pretty big tab here like I showed you guys so if you had this moving along walking shears and let's [ __ ] get it so [Music] [Music] super clean though bro like that ship obviously hurts my chest a little bit cuz I was like a really big dad but not as bad as you rethink your like how big I dad was a gosh it's actually like super clean um I should definitely [ __ ] fire the high out give that like I don't know I'll say it's the best looking box I've had but I feel like I've had more potent whacks um especially like THCA like I've had like that's just I mean well this might this probably is considered thta but um I don't I feel like I've had more potent wax or whatever you want to call it but this is like the best look in my opinion at least and it's why is this on still alive yeah but this is definitely up there though this is that me some of the best ways I've had it not the best um so yeah the packaging I gave like what a 4.5 out of 5 the taste I'm gonna get that a 4 out of 5 that shit's fired Mike doesn't it's not - it's not filled with flavor but it's like super clean like super super clean with like a hint of like sweet fruitiness I'll explain so let me get that like a 4.5 if not a 5 out of 5 because that [ __ ] is near perfect the way it smokes that she drips you see that I'm gonna get out of the street 5 out of 5 probably the high pilot a 4.5 out of 5 close too close to a 5 out of 5 just feel like a patent more potent or acts out there I feel I just feel like I've had more potent wax but not to say that this isn't [ __ ] stupid fire you know Stephanie stupid fire the price points exceed always a gram that's really [ __ ] expensive let's say I have like a buy one get one free deal I wouldn't smoke this on the daily but you feel like a nice little treat here I'm saying picking this up in the future but the price points $60 about this little high I'll get that like a 4 out of 5 the bottle one get one free deal five out of five like basically $30 grand you can't go wrong with that but if you're paying this rates they see that spend it expensive so the overall score and we get out like I did 4.5 out of 5 this is [ __ ] insanely father the one nice my one complaint really is just how expensive is this my one complaint is the [ __ ] price point which was a little bit cheaper you know I'm ballin on a budget out here but um stupid fire and I'm definitely pick it up if you see it in our area but besides for that you guys like this video a good a big thumbs up comment like subscribe if you guys

cartridge video thank you guys for watching you know i really appreciate all the support all the love i've been getting um if you haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i'd really appreciate that but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself my bad on the um uploading videos you know just my schedule is kind of [ __ ] up and i'm gonna be out for like about a month month and a half of work i best pump out a shitload of videos for you guys but today guys um i read that on my cartridge um i've heard of the cure company i was smoking a cartridge of it and kind of ran out so decided to go get another one but if you guys haven't had these cartridges guys they're so fire they're this is the cartridges but the taste is spot on like the quality it's so good it tastes like actual weed you know and the cartridge is ceramic which is dope so that's pretty nice but um i ended up i ended up getting a buddies cartridge guys uh those who've had buddies those who've tried buddies before the cartridge let me know in the comment section of how it was i've never had buddies before the reason i ended up getting it it's just um there's like a couple people that will always comment on my videos saying to try buddies that it's so good this and that so so the good thing about these cartridges that really caught my attention is that their terpene profile they have a label on there um you know um telling you what specifically is in the cartridge which is dope you know to me that's like some good packaging you know really catches my attention you know because i like to see what's in my cartridges and here you have the nice um it tells you what kind of terpenes you know you have in there so that's pretty dope so the total thc on this cartridge is 82 which is not bad for a live resin cartridges because if you guys know live resin ranges from like 60 to 70 percent you know it's not like this lower distal cartridges range from 80s to high 90s so that's pretty dope so here we have the i was looking at the flavors and [ __ ] and this was the one that caught my attention it's a peach flambe pineapple upside down cake that sounds hella good right so that's one of the reasons i ended up getting this cartridge is just like really caught my strain really caught my attention so here you guys have it it's not like a dark amber color like other live resins are like dark amber color like the ursa cartridges or like a moxie live resin you know it's not as dark but it's really clear and it has a nice little tint to it so i'm gonna go ahead and try it out for you guys i was hitting it earlier but you know i'm gonna decide to do a video today uh for you guys because um i'm gonna be going on my little run today i'm right here at a park you know do a little jogging get some runs in you know but other than that guys cheers hopefully you guys are smoking along with me let me show you guys the quality on it it's pretty good you know so we're gonna go ahead and try it out the taste on it it's like spot on it tastes like actual weave that's a good thing about live resins you know um if you guys have these in your pockets after hitting a couple times this thing is going to stink up here man like if you're like in the office or like at your job site or something be sure not to have these in your pocket because these live resident cars just do stink up your pocket and you know people are gonna think you have weed in there that's how strong they are but it tastes really good guys i'm going to take another hit guys to get extra bait you know cheers now the taste to be honest guys it does taste like a little peachy but at the same time you do get the fruitiness of a pineapple which is pretty so the flavor is a little bit peachy and you do get like a nice fruity pineapple flavor to it but it's like a really good clean pineapple it doesn't taste like a fake like a distillery type of flavor you know it tastes really clean you know i'm really satisfied with these cartridges they also have some uh besides the cartridges they also have some wax which i've never had before but i'm definitely gonna have to try them now because these cartridges are fire guys so this is my little label that i got you know my dispensary so you guys can see i don't want to hear another but other than that guys um i've been pretty good myself and i'm just kicking back let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see but i'm gonna be getting into like more weed videos you know like more pre-rolls and [ __ ] like that you know just like i said i've been really busy guys but you know i'm not gonna stop making videos you know what i mean this is this is something i enjoy doing so i'm gonna keep doing it so and also you know let me know if you guys love these types of cartridges these sea salt cartridges are [ __ ] good you know every cartridge option they always hit you know with these cell tips they're like the best ones you guys can get cheers guys i'm already like high as [ __ ] like before i got to the park um i was hitting it like two three times so i'm already loaded so hopefully you guys are smoking along with me man now for the price i ended up paying like thirty five dollars for a full gram cartridge of live resident buddies that's a good as deal guys all right here we go you guys have weed maps look up the shop uh patient care first or just type in pcf just type in pcf and they'll come up and you guys can just literally look on the website and the prices you guys see on there it's the exact same price but just maybe like five dollars with tax you know so it's just [ __ ] cheap everything like cartridges but not dirt dirt cheap but compared to other prices in other cities it's it's a bang for your buck so yeah i'm just trying to get baked that [ __ ] before i go on my little jog [Laughter] it's mandatory you guys get paid before you guys do exercise that makes it so much better i don't got the crawling guys i'm just coughing but other than that guys i really appreciate you guys for watching my videos and if you guys would like to see more videos like this go ahead and leave a like and don't forget to subscribe if you guys are new to the channel i would really appreciate that and don't forget to add the at the instagram and snapchat guys i'm more active on snapchat but i'm gonna try my best to get more on the instagram so let me give you guys a little close up right here other than that guys thanks for watching peace", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at me I'm down I'm always here to help and uh yeah there you go beautiful diamond so you can see they're all nice and clear swimmin oh yeah okay guys I hope that helped enough big Dan over now peace out [Music] [Music]", "JP6nAtU3z2c": "[Music] what is up guys p2 peeps back with another video and this time we're redoing one i might include the footage the failed footage uh earlier or in this video but yeah so i did have a video recorded of this review for the uh buddies liquid diamonds live resin banjo strain review um i did like a whole one outside audio quality was really bad because of the wind and um you know i had it all edited and cut up and then i watched it over again and i was like you know what this this audio quality is so far below standard i don't feel like i should upload it even though the video looks great so we're doing you know a redo so yeah you guys know how we do our cars reviews here before we uh get into anything we take a hit together so everyone at home please pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab get your pen ready all that good stuff because uh you know you know the initial tastes and flavors like how we always do so cheers everybody and the flavor on this thing is impeccable i know you guys know how i feel about it for those of you who have been on stream because this isn't the first time we've seen this cart on the channel you know i did do a live unboxing and first impressions and then i did a live comparison and review between this and the distillate cart the uh legendo g and watermelon skittles cart so sorry just had to take a quick deep breath there and um yeah let's get into how we're feeling on the flavors here it's a very very nice sweet citrusy tone uh pretty much throughout the throughout the whole way you know um i have had banjo as a strained in flour a few times and i wouldn't i was never able to really uh taste this deep of citrus flavor so i really really like that about this cartridge it's got a very nice you know very necessity suite and i love that you know i'm a big sucker for oranges so you know citrusy sweet is very reminiscent of oranges so yeah another good thing i like about buddies cars just as a general thing to say they have the terpene profiles on the back of every box and i feel like that should be included for like pretty much all uh live resin or just any uh you know cartridge that has terpenes in it you know if you're gonna flex that you've got some terpenes in there let's see the breakdown too you know but yeah i really really like the sweetness to this there's no tang to it really but uh it does have a really nice coating coating flavor you know you get you feel a lot of the flavor after the initial taste like in this back area of your mouth you know the very back and kind of the roofs of the mouth as well almost like you bit into a very sweet fruit you know how the the taste kind of lingers there so yeah let's uh take one more hit here to uh see if we can find anything different i mean you guys already know i'm kind of you know thoroughly testing this one it's about half the way through but yeah so you guys know the drill get that bowl ready get your dab ready get that pen out because we're about to get hit cheers everybody okay so i get also a nice uh gassy piney-ness there too at the very start very very nice there yeah you know this is very deep terps on it i'm very impressed with just buddy's products in general you know i was really really satisfied with their uh cannabis drive terpenes cart and i'm even more satisfied with this liquid diamonds car you know i don't think i've had any other liquid diamond live resin cards out there i'm not sure what the difference is between a liquid diamond left resin cart and a regular live resin cart is but if that's something you guys would like me to figure out find out and all that good stuff then i'll be happy to do that but yeah that should about wrap it up for this video um my final thoughts on this cartridge is that you should try it i think this banter as someone who's not a sativa fan and banjo is a sativa strain this is excellent down to its you know effect you know i'm feeling real good right now and i still have euphoria all that all that good stuff it's a really really worth it cart and you know for those of you who aren't there for my comparison between the distillate and the live resin uh buddies cartridges just know that we'll we will be having a cartridge comparisons episode for that yeah thank you guys for watching if you enjoyed you know the drill like comment subscribe all that good stuff uh it's great seeing you guys out there and i hope to see some of you in the live stream sometimes p2 out peace", "rEwwGUg7IR0": "all right y'all i know this is a weird angle but i don't have my my gimbal is not working i mean it's working but i gotta charge it and i can't wait to make this video anymore because i'm about to finish this card so let's get straight to the video man today we're gonna be reviewing the live resin liquid diamond live resin buddies cartridge man so this cartridge was forty dollars out the door this is gonna be a full gram cartridge um the strain is gonna be sapphire og and triangle kush box first this is what the box is going to be looking like a nice mint colored box is going to be sapphire og and triangle kush it's going to be a low thc percentage at 69 cec but i will say that thc percentage has nothing to do with how hard it hits because it's one of the better cards that i've had um there's going to be indica dominant or straight indica i love my indicas um in the goods and higher bridges are my favorite sativas i like every now and then but indicators are going to be my favorite there's gonna be no cbd 72 percent total cannabinoids like i said liquid diamonds like resin um i was expecting the liquid to be darker but it's actually pretty clear and you could tell it's not distillate because of the leftover that's on the glass it looks like live resin you know like it looks like sauce or something and there's like little bits that are just hanging and stuff i don't know you could just tell this liquid looks different the consistency of this liquid is is not like a raw garden that has some clear ass supposedly light resin and it was just this the lip this is going to be the side right here you guys want to pause and read that this is the back gives you a lot of information in the back a lot of [ __ ] i don't even like i don't know what none of this stuff is here i just know what you know the tfc percentage is there's something cool about this i mean it's not like cool but something that i noticed most companies will put in hell for two to three seconds here it puts inhale until the desired effect is achieved that's pretty like you know that's something slick that you could add to your to your box these are all the terpene profiles uh what makes some like the natural terpene so what you guys don't know terpenes are just taste there's terpenes and everything i'm pretty sure there's you know terpenes in this gatorade disturbance in there so the way you open this just from the top there's gonna be a cart in there a clear box i mean and this is what the car is going to be looking like i've today's monday i've had this since friday i've been using it a good amount um i will say that it did go by a bit quicker than i wanted it to uh i don't know what i say is worth it though i got it for 40 bucks it's cool you know what i'm saying like for the price i just like if it was like 30 35 bucks it'll make more sense to me i'm pretty sure the distillate ones are like 30 35 bucks but i don't know i'm just like i expected it to be a lot more crazy you told me like this just kind of reminds me like a boy i don't know reminds me like almost i don't know man one thing i will say about this though the flavor is different i haven't tasted really any cartridges like this this is a unique taste i really like the sapphire og and triangle kush recommend this one if you guys haven't had buddies in general all right y'all so i'm gonna just put it in the battery for y'all take a hit and um so you guys can see what it's hitting like it should it hits cool you feel me um for flavor i'm gonna have to give it like an eight out of ten for the high like eight out of ten overcard is like a eight out of ten you feel me it's cool you feel me like it's not you know nothing crazy let me take a blinker for y'all [Music] it is a really [ __ ] smooth car though i will give it that um i'll say smoother than a hotter cartridge i said i'd say this is probably one of the smoothest cards i've had um like you guys saw it's like a blinker still able to talk after and all that so i don't know i don't know how i feel about this i'll give it like an eight out of ten filming i think that's like a solid score for this um nothing too crazy uh it's not the worst but if you haven't tried it i would for sure try them out just because the flavor is so unique on them haven't really had anything like them and uh yeah man so like i said i got this for forty dollars out the door um this is gonna be the liquid diamond one i believe buddies does also make a distillate one that one was probably like thirty dollars out the door i have to ask um i have to ask if they have the distilled ones maybe i'll get one and i know they have some cbd thc ones but i don't i don't like that [ __ ] show me i just like straight tvc cbd is cool should be cool for like uh syrup edibles and [ __ ] like that but straight up tastes like you're taking a dab i wouldn't say a weed i'll say more like taking this like it tastes like diamonds bro for real for real that's what it is bro it tastes like [ __ ] diamonds they're not capping about that liquid liquid diamond [ __ ] yeah it should taste like diamonds because i just had some diamonds you guys haven't seen in the video uploaded right before this one i believe it's the king's garden one tastes just like it bro what the [ __ ] yeah that's what it is man this should taste like straight diamonds you guys had diamonds before actual dish that's what this [ __ ] tastes like i don't know what number this is number one hopefully y'all enjoy the video hopefully i taught y'all some hopefully i learned something hopefully i inspired y'all to go get this hopefully i got lit with me man and i'll catch you in the next one peace", "h9vKMZg_Gt0": "in today's [ __ ] video gonna be doing a whole [ __ ]

better see my alright yeah peace hope you like it", "i8dC6xmYUo4": "[Music] yo guys what is going on Ethan here today we're just going to be reviewing some avocado gorilla glue number four hybrid diamond sauce live resin so it's a Graham here's what I guess the cap looks like trying to get it like in focus and I'm gonna take the cap off and just show you guys what it looks like real quick so it's really like saucy I like how this is so it's not like a hard thing like shatter so it's really nice trying to get like a good view but it's like saucy so I went and took a picture of it on my phone for you guys I'm gonna put that up on the screen so you guys can see what it looks like in a higher quality so I'm gonna go ahead and where do you go there it is I'm gonna go ahead and scoop myself a little bit actually you guys have been complaining about how much I've been scooping saying I've been scooping too little so I'm gonna get a little more than what I usually get I guess that seems like a decent amount you know it seems pretty decent so here is here's I don't think anyone should complain about that that size so then here's my piece and I'm using the G pen connect I do want to get the Jeep and Rome that's something I do want to possibly get so there we go it's all dropped in I'm probably gonna need to reheat it just because it's such a big dab but let's go ahead put the cap on I like to like preheat it a little bit and then I go ahead and click it twice and then I wait for it to get solid and then I wait for like another two seconds and then I start hitting it so now is fine oh the flavor on this is so good I don't sleep like one of the best resins I've ever charged Oh thing makes me cough ooh let me see if there's any more I don't know if I burned it all or not there's definitely some more so I'm gonna go ahead give it around to oh that one actually burned better that's cuz a plate was already hot so did it take as long to heat up geez oh no that's gonna be it for the video and let me know how you guys are doing during this Cove in nineteen hopefully everything is getting better from what I've been hearing it's getting better so I hope it keeps staying like that so this is the avocado gorilla glue number four Diamond sauce live resin one gram it's a hybrid from California so I'm gonna make that the thumbnail don't know what I'm gonna do for the thumbnail maybe I'll take it from my phone I'll see you but if you guys like video make sure to leave a like subscribe and comment I've been reading the comments lot and very active as well on Twitter and stuff like that so that's me if the video thanks for watching subscribe comment leave a like I just said that but it's really important thing you guys peace [Music] you", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "FsAQNRb5FFk": "what is up YouTube amateur Blavatsky's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today

really excited these cartridges are new they just hit my dispensary I looked them up on Instagram I have like 2000 followers so they're just like kind of new to the market as well but these these are like alright these are game changers you know as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here press this button hey let me show you guys a little close-up ice cream cake and it's a 76 percent THC what I think yeah 76 percent so yeah guys this is pretty dope you know the everyone that the shot was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them

guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just

make it because checking on my food I know I just order a tec-9 to Longueville but stay positive stay medicated and pizza Rochelle", "WheOc80F8Wo": "so let's start on the left we're gonna make diamonds out of your on the right right now is we are reducing there are extract or BHO extract we like to put it inside of we got this bucket you seen the last picture it's got a little bit of warm water it is not hot water it's just warm water we're gonna reduce it down to for the diamonds we want it to become the consistency of a boat syrup before we're gonna cap it and put it somewhere warm and pretty much forget about it for a few weeks and then for adds or shatter if you don't know how to make shatter we're gonna reduce that down to about syrup then pour it into our back oven onto our patch of parchment paper and then we're gonna let it bubble away and then pull it back on it full30 an inch of warm water and on hot water just warm water in there gonna take a little while through these it's what we want - I'll be 20 minutes half an hour there like that probably have to change the water a couple times keep it warm as the extract is really cold the process to walk you through it oh yeah we can make diamond can make diamond - all right you can see how much we reduced it down your way up here before it was quite a bit lighter we still got some bubbles just good because to make time as you need pressure also need a supersaturated solution which is this butane and THC and yeah time just go wait time so we're gonna we're gonna do is when it's a little cap on this we're gonna stick it up on our clone seedling rack because it's got a it's a warm base which will help with the pressure build up because as the gas or as the liquid turns into gas it builds up enough pressure in here and helps the process take place good no it's not quite at syrup consistency yet which is okay we can just let the pressure build up give it a little burp we do that over a period of a couple days until we get it tell it's like a little run here than syrup and then we're just gonna leave the cap on it and we're not gonna touch it again till we get diamonds you can see now that I burped it there's bubbles from the gases escaping from the supersaturated solution back into gas which pressurizes this back back up again okay so it reduced a little bit more this one here we weren't working with see how runny that is I mean it's still just like water make snake water this is the death Bubba here and see it doesn't splash like that when you shake it it's thicker hard to tell you definitely a sticky substance yeah shake it doesn't splash up the sides a whole lot that's how we like it see the little bubbles coming up pressure up we're gonna leave it at that we're just gonna set it and set it forget it turn it off in the back corner here and we'll come check it in a couple weeks and we've got diamonds in the bottom there it kind of look like little air bubbles when they first start forming but their crystals will show you once we get to that point you [Music] [Music]", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "-LOgUO7XJMU": "[Music] what's up guys simply secure and back with another video we got our NJ takes a picture Jimmy no RJ eats subscribe to the home he's about 580 right now let's get him to 600 should be a easy goal you know I'm saying but this is not about RJ even though he's in here subscribe to him but but if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge and this is by far the cheapest live resin cart that I was able to get my hands on I did give money to Randy cuz he stopped by the club yesterday and he bought it for me I've been mowing him the money and he got it from me but this is buddies and this was for 30 to 50 and this is about the cheapest live resin car I've ever like received or not received but and yeah I've tried buddy's before so nothing like special or new here but it is a new strain it is a lien push can you open it hold on we're gonna have a Randy open it not right now I'm gonna oh it shows the back first so these are the terpenes that are on there as you know with buddies and you can see right there on the right it says manufactured April 3rd that's by April 3rd 2021 all that good stuff you know just talking a monoids 280 7.39 on that alright let's go just get this pop oh and baby just come of it yeah so you can see very similar to the select cartridge I've had a buddy's cartridge before guys so hold on thumbnail right here hey there we go all right my ugly askin to or not it's a bad habit but a lot of people do and trying to start the bad [ __ ] done better anyways but you can see right here it's very much similar to the cartridge type of select but this is alien cush so I'm interested to see if this tastes like [ __ ] uh thank the lemon salt stuff that everything's been tasting like I hope not even though I like the taste of that is not bad it's just you know I'm kind of like all right kind of taste something different so was the first time you tried buddy's cars only like five four or five months ago so I've had it before they definitely run out quick these cartridge types the they go out quick turn it off we're gonna take a blinker so they don't last as usual as long as like a water and probably like a short like a day or two earlier it would run out on me but cheers boys popping a session below what you guys just smoking up let us know man always keep us updated to keep us in the mix we want to know man you know I saw some strains you guys are commenting on the other day kind of forgot honestly all the names oh well that's a hitter and yes the cartridge hits and apparently it says these are ceramic coil carts as well so that's a that's probably why it tastes very very much it's a tasty experience that's probably like looking resort so a real stoner high then this is the wood good starter huh just good tastes good it doesn't taste like the light like like an OG Kush it is alien Kush you know so it definitely has the more flour taste and then the more citrusy taste that you would generally get from sativas or everything else on the market you know saying but that was a good hair right yeah excuse me boys let me take another hit and we're probably gonna call it a video after he gets another hit and he's gonna do a blinker no blinker I got not beat so hot from the room that had a good level huh just so you guys don't think don't believe me with the 3250 program I'm gonna show you it's a dirty price huh for live resin that's a very good price and you know this this video is not gonna come out until like a week or two so I don't know if they're still gonna have it but I will show you the proof right now just so you guys believe me and it's not all talk you might make the drive from where you're at just to get like you know she's in product yeah so 32:54 the alien cushion 30 to 50 for the blue skittles as well so cheering yeah but yes stay tuned we're also gonna be doing another video with money I know you guys have been requesting money or aka be cheapened because he can take fat hits that hits the ones that you like to see you know I'm saying like he will take those packets and yeah my homie don't give a [ __ ] so I'm gonna take one more hit how do you like this cartridge so far 8250 would you buy it and consider buying it for 30 to 50 yes I would anything higher than that probably not it was more than 40 I probably not go ahead and buy a cart unless I know it was beating some fire I'm saying this is I don't know definitely it you can spend basically happy oh yeah you can split that in half in at 2 grabs with some wax spend another $3 each you know on each one you get some decent good wax yeah but as a cartridge person once again he's getting price on the cartridge yeah I'd buy it for that price that's a good-ass price on the it for grams - that's not you're spending like half a gram sometimes almost at same price for even just a little less so that already tells you that's a good purchase you know yeah yeah definitely what's go in and buy something like that if I was looking to buy a car okay that's good to hear we are gonna end the video here guys hopefully you enjoyed it subscribe all that good stuff like the video if you enjoyed it subscribe to rj eats and see you guys the next one [Music]", "Eeb0xoEcjgo": "our next speaker is dr. Sally Eaton Magana from GI researcher in Carlsbad and she's going to present to you a review of CBD synthetic diamonds seen in the g i-- laboratory morning thank you I'll be speaking today about a review of CBD laboratory grown diamonds as we've seen at the g i-- in laboratory i wanted to start off first by reviewing some of the extraordinary physical properties that we see for Diamond has a lot of these have motivated a lot of the research that has happened for CBD diamond to use it as a in both industrial and semiconductor applications so we know that diamond has the highest hardness it has the highest thermal conductivity it has the highest molar density the lowest compressibility and the highest sound propagation velocity of any terrestrial material it also has extreme resistance to acids corrosion and radiation and it has an extremely low thermal expansion coefficient now I don't think anyone's going to buy a gem diamond because it has the highest sound propagation velocity but I think this compilation of properties serves to illustrate how extraordinary and incomparable and unique diamond itself is both as a material and as a gem so chemical vapor deposition growth proceeds by feeding in a hydrocarbon gas typically methane about 1% in about 99 percent hydrogen into a vacuum chamber and then these gases are then excited by microwave plasma now the reason why they feed in so much hydrogen is because CVD growth proceeds down in the graphite stability zone so they need that much hydrogen in there in order to suppress the simultaneous growth of graphite and the CVD technology has progressed enough that now they're able to create CVD diamonds that are chemically pure that they are repeatable and that they are able to tailor the physical properties to the desired application so I'm showing here a movie of how the what's happening down at the growing diamond surface the microwave plasma splits apart the gas molecules into fragments and radicals and those diffuse down to the colder surface the substrate and precipitate out as solid carbon of what we typically see after they've run for extended period of time as we see non diamond carbon around the periphery that is they can either clean that off and put it back in the reactor and grow further or they can just laser cut all that off and then facet it into a polished gem so we've been looking at CVD diamonds for a large large number of years at DIA for being back at least 15 and we've seen quite a bit of evolution in the gem products that we've seen for CVD back in 2003 we were seeing very small and all brown color and we saw that for a fair number of years until about 2010 when we started seeing near colorless products and then since then we've started to see this evolution in size and we've seen a number of size milestones in the years since then the largest one has been seen thus far is a six point two one carat D color that we saw at a trade show back in June we're also seeing some larger size fancy color products as well at the other end of the size spectrum we're also seeing Mellie size cvd diamonds also this is one back that was sent in to GI a form le sorting it's about thirty point eight total carat weight and the vast majority of them are CVD now we don't often see this percentage or this higher quantity we'd normally see far more natural or HP HD synthetics but this does show that CVD Meli are being produced for the tray now this next series of slides is gonna be documenting some of the trends that we've seen @gi over the years we have put together a database of every CVD diamond that has come through our lab either for research purposes I was donated or loaned to us by the manufacturer or that has been submitted to us for grading reports and so we've chronicled all the properties of about over a thousand of these cv DS and I'm gonna summarize these data on the next couple of slides in some of the years we didn't see a lot so we've grouped some of these years together so just here and here but we have data running up through June up to 2018 sorry so for this slide I'm showing the weight distribution that we've seen over the years for CVD diamonds back in the early years we saw mostly diamonds that were less than half a carat and as we've gone through time we've seen that this has progressed into larger weights so that in this year we're seeing most of the diamonds that we're seeing are greater than one carat and we're seeing a good percentage that are over 2 carats as well this slide shows the color distribution that we've seen over the years for CVD grown diamonds you'll see that the vast majority of them are in the near colorless range from G up to about N and we have a much smaller percentage that are what we would call in the colorless range of D to F H PhD synthetics we see a much higher percentage of those that are in the colorless range compared to the CV DS we also for the last couple years we have seen a fair number of faint or very light gray diamonds as well those were most likely intended to be on the D to Z scale but they had enough grayish component that they were called fancy gray instead among the fence among the other fancy colors we predominately see dot C V DS that are pink in color either from NB centers due to post growth treatment or a 520 nanometer absorption band also in recent years we have seen some green blue diamonds due to post growth radiation this slide prana calls the amount of sea the quantity of CV DS that we have seen each year and we're referencing that to the total intake of all diamonds submitted to g IA for grading reports both D to Z and fancy color so you can see over the years we have seen a dramatic increase in the total number of CV DS that have been submitted to the lab since 2017 when we started issuing grading points grading reports for CV DS but one thing I did want to point out is that this total percentage is still very low this the highest one we've seen is about 0.01 percent or 1 in every 10,000 diamonds that kinda dia is a CVD gram so we're still looking at very small overall percentages also we can look at the clarity features and the clarity grades that most of them are in the VV s to 2 vs 1 range we do see some at the extremes of the if2 i2 and when we do see inclusions what we typically see are non diamond carbon usually dark in color and they can either be seen as pinpoints or congregated into clouds but this is fairly representative what we would see as inclusions in these CDs when inclusions are present also showing the long rated UV fluorescence that we often see for these CD DS and putting them into two different categories because there's such a difference between what we saw from 2003 to 2013 and then from 2014 on in the early years 8% did show some measurable fluorescence and when and that was typically orange yellow or green in the years since 2014 almost all of the diamond CV DS that we see have no fluorescence at all and when the few the very few that did show some were faint blue also a lot of the near colorless CV DS that we see have been H PhD treated we've gone through all of the cv DS that have been submitted and we've gone through each one and decided and determine whether they were submitted to us as brown or whether they went through this HP HD processing aftergrowth now the reason they do that is because a manufacturer can grow the cv d faster and if when they and when they do grow it faster it goes as brown but they will grow it faster because they know they can do this HP HT processing afterwards to improve the color into the near colorless range the process that they do with these cv DS is very similar to what is done for natural diamonds that have a plastic deformation and the brownish color there it's a similar process and a similar effect so we went through and so how many of these near colorless diamonds cv DS have been HP HT treated and we can see that about a three-quarters of them have gone through this post growth treatment one way we tell that is by using this DP UV fluorescence or diamond view we showed earlier how effective it is for looking at natural diamonds it's also good for looking at cv DS as well and we can fit one one thing we can tell immediately from looking at these is that there's a very good difference between what we see for Diamond view in the as grown CV DS versus those that have been HP HT processed there's a very distinct difference in the observed chemistry and that affects your your fluorescence color so the as grown have a lot are dominated by nitrogen vacancy centers and the ones we see for HP HP processing are mostly dominated by h3 and envy and they have the greenish blue to green color also one thing I want to point out on these DVDs is we can often see the presence is the presence of these layers here as I mentioned earlier they will often stop the process clean off this growing CVD and put it back in the reactor for further growth and we can see that process by looking at the bite by a well defined interface layer between the different growth events so we can see it in this time and then right here and then over on the line right there and the reason why that's important is that it's such an obvious indicator that these are CVD grown diamonds so we've done some research looking into that interface layer so that we can see what is causing that to show such different and brighter fluorescence so this is one of the CV DS that it was grown in our New Jersey facility it our substrate is a natural diamond and then we grew five different CVD layers on top of that and it shows what it looks like indivisible we can see each of the individual CVD layers and we can see that also if you look at it in the fluorescence image and then also in the phosphorescence we can see some distinct differences at the interfaces between the CVD layers we can also do Raman mapping on this slice by looking straight from the natural all the way up through each of the layers and begin chronicle the changes in the defect centers as we go from the natural through all of the layers and also what happens at the interfaces so over here on the far right of this plot we have the natural stone and then as and then as we deposit the first layer we see a huge spike in the vacancy related centers and be neutral negative NV and negative silicon vacancy all of those show a huge spike right here at the interface of then decays as we continue to grow that layer oomiya the second layer we again see a spike in all of these vacancy related centers similarly we can look at other defects that are occurring within the CVD diamond such as what we're seeing a much higher concentrations within the CVD LA or - we're seeing much higher concentrations of as grown defects such as those we see at 5 9 6 597 and 468 and we also see in much higher concentrations of nickel in that particular layer and if you look at the diamond itself we can see that that is the brownest of all the CVD your own layers we are seeing in this diamond also CVD the process is able to create very unique products that just aren't duplicated in nature this particular diamond CVD was created by putting in massive amounts of silicon into the growth process and that's and what that does is it creates a very large defect center for the negative silicon vacancy and for the silicon vacancy and that is what's causing this pink color here when you expose it to UV light you take that negative silicon vacancy and you can get into neutral and that causes the color to shift from pink to blue and so this is one of my favorite types of CV DS because it is such an interesting scientific phenomena and you're also being able to switch reversibly and repeatably between two very attractive colors also recently we've been seeing CVD overgrowth in the trade this is something we've been investigating for the last 10 years and but we've only recently had a stone submit last 2gi a last summer so I'm going to talk about a few minutes about this one this was a fancy blue as submitted 0.33 carats and the and the blue color is due entirely due to this type 2b CVD grown layer of 80 microns thickness right on the table and you can tell easily that it is a composite product just from looking at the diamond view where on the pavilion side you see the the fluorescence typical of natural stones and then on the table we do see the the CVD layer now we some of the tests we've done on thinner samples of less than 80 microns typically around 10 typically around 10 microns those show much lower durability and and the the blue color is not being maintained in those thinner thickness coatings and so we are also curious about what occurs for the durability issues for these thicker CVD layers as well since then we've either seen or vent or heard of two other lab submissions of diamonds with CVD overgrowth this one was submitted to NGTC in October of last year it was an L color of 0.1 one carat and you can see that the majority of the weight of for that particular diamond was from the CVD and then in the summer of this year the DIA Carlsbad lab received in a fancy gray greyish greenish blue stone I was about two point six four carats and ten points of that stone was due to a type 2b CVD layer so so for this stone we believe the intent of it was to add weight to you know more than double the weight of it and then and then this done was to add the blue color as we saw for that first one on the previous slide also I showed a picture of this earlier but this diamond is noteworthy because it's such a large size CVD and as an attractive color it's a fancy intense pinkish orange and so I wanted to highlight this one because they are able to make these attractive color gem products that are in a larger size what other thing I wanted to illustrate is the diamond view image is for this particular stone due to the high amount of nitrogen vacancy centers and this it makes it difficult to see the CVD growth related features so this is something that we're seeing a little more and we've had to span out into other imaging techniques such as cathodoluminescence that shows the government striations for CVD better I also wanted to mention a couple of other products these are some flat plate samples that were sent to us by a CVD manufacturer that are also producing some faceted goods I believe that this is some of their experimental work but they'll probably be faceting similar material and in the next year or so but these are two flat plates that are both bluish in color and they are both type 2b and you can see from the IR spectra that they have massive amounts of boron this top one here has over 10,000 parts per billion of boron and to put that in perspective I'm referring you back to some surveys we've done previously on type 2b natural diamonds which the highest value for that was 1500 parts per billion and the median for those were 300 and then and then a survey of some HP HT ground diamonds in which the highest among those was 446 30 so this diamond at two and a half times more boron than what we've seen in the highest of the HP HT grown so that's definitely one hallmark that we've seen among these 2 VC V DS another interesting product that we saw from that manufacturer was this 2.3 karat flat plate that was determined to be fancy black and it's a new cause of color of black color for diamond the color is due to very strong nitrogen vacancy centers and if you look and transmitted light you can see that it has these red undertones due to the env but usually if you have lower amounts of env then the diamond will appear as pink or as red but this particular stone it's so much envy that it just created a black color for the stone so I'm going to finish up just by going over some of the identifiers that we use and the gemologist can use to determine if a stone is a CVD grown diamond so firstly you know visually as we mentioned earlier many of them have high clarity vbs2 - vs1 but they often have small black inclusions or pinpoints due to non diamond carbon also in cross polarisers they often have a strain pattern that's very distinct from what we see in HP HT synthetics that often do not show a strain pattern but it is quite someone to what we see in naturals as we mentioned earlier long wave UV is usually inert especially among more recently grown cv DS but they can show a green yellow or orange in the shortwave UV we do see a little bit more variety if it's an if it's as ground it's usually inert but it can show the yellow the orange and then of a ph.d process we can see green fluorescence or green of green blue phosphorescence and then the deep UV imaging that can show a wide variety as I showed it as well that is also indicates whether a stone has been as Brown or HP HT treated and then finally for some of the advanced spectroscopy we can do FTIR and we can see that determine the diamond type there - a 1 B or to B and then some as grown samples do show some CVD specific peaks and then from photo luminescence at liquid nitrogen temperature we see things that are specific to CVD such as the silicon vacancy and this 596 597 doublet and then thank you very much and if if you weren't doing any further reading I recommend that article a question or two I don't see anyone's okay thank you so much hello good morning everybody and just a quick question how do you measure the quantity of the born in the diamond which kind of method do you use there's a couple of different methods one is one was developed by Al Collins back in the early 70s and then David Fisher who's I believes in the audience I helped advance it in this 2009 article and that's based off the area of the 2,800 peak and then alcohol ins more recently did didn't a conversion for the 1290 peak that we see in these TV samples and that's the one we had to use for these because the 2800 was so saturated because of the very high amount of boron so we didn't use the conversion from from alan collins based on the 1290 peak and what is the margin error measuring the barn I mean the deranged basically how precisely we can measure this well it's well for the samples we did we did a full-body so there can be some local variations we did some also he did some mapping for that particular stone that wasn't quite as effective as the normal way we collect FTIR okay thank you very much Thank You Sally [Applause]", "-CUt-lv2upQ": "hi guys it's 4:00 here today with our staff will diamond miner you can see this insert has eight different shelves it comes standard with these crystallizing dishes there are 100 millimeters around 100 million diameter just it right onto the Shelf comes with these slick pads to keep it from moving as you can see when I tilt it it doesn't want to go anywhere so you can also fit some mason jars on if you like these are four ounce wide mouth mason jars 15 per shelf if you're trying to do different mixtures or testing with different strains so I'm going to lower this shelving unit into the spool all right after it's in there we have our top cap to put on top it comes standard with a nitrogen port right here what the jig fit in there's a sight glass in the middle a pressure gauge and that pressure relief this pressure leaves adjustable just by turning this you can set it prior to entering your material I still have to do a little bit of plug and play with it different pressures with nitrogen I was trying to put this gasket on here put the cap right on top and even though we're not using much pressure a lot of people tend to use under 10 psi even we're still going to use these high pressure clamps the roof system is rated for 100 psi so you can see right here there's the outlet for your jacket there's an inlet at the bottom and you can run your liquid through the outside to keep the whole vessel at a certain temperature throughout the duration of your my name alright so you can see in the cyclist here you can see your top container any diamonds that start to form you'll be able to watch them through the sight glass I'm gonna show you how to take out this rack to take off the top right so while the diamonds are forming it's recommended not to move the Machine at all so just set it leave it and then come back in a little while maybe even two weeks or so and you'll have some formation thanks for watching", "hIMGW7xxh4I": "[Music] what is up YouTube my name is Jimmy Oh welcome to the Jimmy chocolates 4/20 channel in today's video we're gonna be having a nice chill smoke session basically we take the nice fat bong in and we're gonna be taking a dab of a diamond we got my last diamond here of some 398 ghost one stand up show that to you guys I figured what better way to take the last dab or to dab my last diamond than be to record a YouTube video for it I would post to my Instagram but suppose you guys who don't know I did have an Instagram account he had thirteen point three thousand followers it got deleted and then I managed to get it back the next day so it's kind of making me kind of cautious to post to it I don't want it to get deleted again for no reason so I'm trying to kind of lay low on Instagram and I want to start posting more to the YouTube channel so let's just go ahead and start breaking up a bowl and we're gonna want to take a bat ball here real quick and then of course we're gonna go ahead and get into the dab I got the rebels glass ring here I felt like I should start recording more of my setup but here are the pendants by the way rebels glass the one on the left the pipe pendant is actually fully functional I could smoke out of this pipe if I wanted to I don't think both of them are rebels glass though just this one on the right here oh yeah guys you guys already know it so when it comes down to the content in general that I'm trying to make it doesn't even matter if it's not cannabis related I don't have to be smoking in the video for me to post it just know that you so if you guys do want to see me play different video games you know scary games whatever you guys want to see just throw it down in the comments I keep on trying to bounce off of what you guys are suggesting me so that way I can uh overall just have more content to post for you because I do want to post content that I enjoy to create as well and that's why I'm trying so hard to make gaming content cuz I love gaming content it's like my favorite kind of videos to make it's just I finally got a PC how to edit and I'm just getting better at it so we got some good games coming out this year as well we got modern warfare we got Gears of War 5 I cannot wait for both of those games and hopefully we get some new horror games coming out here soon because escape that I you Loki which is the game you guys see me get jumpscared by it's a michael jackson horror game hopefully the developers of that game can make another horror game here soon because they did a really good job at the last game that did so shout out to deadly crow games i did say in the beginning of this video that we are going to dab on this diamond so right after the ball okay we're gonna go ahead and take that dap and i might come up close to you guys so you guys can see what it looks like but cheers let's go and [ __ ] rip this down rockin the new devilish trio shirt badass [ __ ] t-shirt usually all their shirts that they have are in black or white this one's navy blue so this shit's tight anyways Cheers I've said it in many videos before you got to see how hard I try to pull this bowl if this bowl was a conventional style bowl I would have snapped it but I tried to avoid snapping it so that way I can keep my glass cleaner got a built-in glass screen those are actually like some of the best bowls out there if you guys ask me because it allows you to burn all of your weed evenly without wasting any of it plus it keeps your bong way cleaner of course we got the dabit Aladin sword gavvers Gavilan swords always my favorite so what I'm gonna do I'm probably gonna heat up the dab like right here and then I kind of want to walk around in front of the camera and take a DAB up close so you guys can see it milk up beautiful diamond so let's go ahead and get this [ __ ] and thank you guys for [ __ ] watching the videos keep in mind guys I'm not just a cannabis Channel that's just where I started so this is just like the content you guys are used to saying there's plenty more kind of play more styles of content that you guys are going to see from me in the future so we're gonna take the dab like this got the dab right there alright everybody Cheers telling you guys when you hit those dabs and you pack them deep into your lungs little shits hit you right behind the eyes anyways guys I appreciate you for [ __ ] watching this video that's most likely gonna be it I just wanted to kind of take this last dab this last diamond that I had and kind of show it off to somebody however like I said I've been kind of nervous to post on Instagram saying is they deleted my account and then gave it back like a literally the next day so and plus Luke losing 13 thousand followers is kind of it's [ __ ] up so you know I don't want to lose that again so thank you guys for [ __ ] stick with me thank you guys for watching this video if you guys enjoyed it leave me some video suggestions in the comments below for other videos you guys would like to see other than that subscribe for more have a great [ __ ] day", "nxlld7RYbgk": "hi welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing the buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge strain on this one is sherbert or sherbet i don't i don't know not really sure if they spelled that wrong or what but buddies liquid diamonds live resins are pretty much my go-to card as of right now they're very good quality i would say like gold standard of quality for their price um you can get slightly better stuff but you're gonna end up paying part uh prices that i i wouldn't consider worth it anymore so these are a very good cartridge itself very good oil inside it's very consistent it's very terpy and has a good effect every single time so you know what you're getting so let's get into the packaging and then i will open it up try it out and we'll see what i think all right so here's the packaging up close as you can see i buy a lot of these they even give me a bulk buff for them um let's grab one of these out here i've taken the sticker off so you can see they put the price sticker over these so not too much being missed on these sides luckily so i'll toss that aside here so we got what are we looking at here it's 72.27 percent thc one point zero seven percent cannabidiol um seventy eight point five percent total cannabinoids in indica but um if you ask me straight names or indica steve doesn't need anything anymore with cross breeding we'll get the side information let you pause that and read it if you want to and then you have nothing on that side nothing on the bottom buddies logo on the top and then i love about these is you got the terp profile well at least top three so you can kind of know what you're going to be getting into some more info there the verification that rc number um i got this one because it has humulene in it i've been really looking for that but you'll find a lot of these that's not a good example but a lot of these are much more terpy let's see if i can find i've had these come up to 16 turks and it was just like ridiculous okay it's funny now i can't even find them so maybe they are average i would say six to nine percent terpenes for the distillates closer to uh like one to four percent there we go there's those are two so yeah this stuff's pretty terpy it's good stuff though i'll get to open it now all right let's get into it my vessel rolling around here pop it open here i don't remember what that says when i focus then you got that which just fell out but that's all right um you got the tube that it always comes in pretty sure it's upside down which will list a thc enabled cbd instead of cbg then card itself it's a very nice looking liquid live resin i found this stuff which i think is usual for live resin can occasionally be even like a little bit liquid at room temp flowing somewhat freely and stuff but i believe that just um was with the two that were extremely derpy like 12 to 14 percent so i always take the stickers off here i'll finish up later now let's pop it in excited to see what sherbet sherbet is like and right away that's just such a smooth hit the pool has like some nice resistance you get amazing vapor from it so i love that draw tip it's really pretty slick all right so i mean taste wise the last couple i had were about almost like double the terpene yeah terpene content so this one's kind of weak for me but really hard to pin down actually it's very neutral but um i would just say it's like it's it's vaguely vaguely sweet vaguely herbal that humiliating adds something i'm trying to describe it because humulin is what is in hops and beer so if you know that flavor that's what i'm getting from this you'll see a lot of this stuff you'll probably um if you want to look into terpenes ever you'll know that a lot of other foods and stuff have these terpenes so you can get an idea of what you're going to taste which is what i love about these carts they show you so yeah we're getting um cardio filling which is like kind of peppery it's almost the same amount with limonene so those are matching up with a kind of citrusy taste and then it's kind of complemented by like a a hoppy taste which i'm not a beer drinker and especially whenever i was it was nothing hoppy at all i do not like ips or anything so i'm not familiar with that i can't really like explain it well but that's what it would taste like if you know that so really really a good cart for thirty dollars i paid um thirty six dollars for recreational users i have my med card definitely recommend that i recommend at least trying it if you usually go for a distillate card or any other ones this is like my go-to so hope you enjoyed the video i'm going to be trying to get another one here because i picked up some distillate syringes and i'll be getting those once my ceramic cartridges come in so hope to see you then thanks for watching", "yxIr-ENkgis": "welcome back to reviews on the ABS today we got a little special pickup that I had it is a lot of people don't know about this they refer to a step down from a live resin but this is considered a diamond sauce they get this focus back in real quick diamond sauce from Gold Coast today one of the top extracts come on I'm making it there you go so it's it's it's one cannabis cups multiple times this is the kosher cush strand and I'm not sure on the actual percentage on it but let me break it down for you this is the labeling for it let's see there it is clear diamond sauce easy way to break it down is they break down every type trooping they can find they break down a lot of different types of triumphs explain it terpenes the cabinets and everything and they they pull it out to like the purest form you can get and then they let it sit like LED wine pretty much and it crystallizes always making sure that you burp it that's what this is what I've heard I'm not like we hopefully expert on it I'm just ill getting to learn just like everybody else but you can get a view on that baby right there there's some diamond today but snow overall smells just like you just rub your hand up and down a [ __ ] plant jacked it off literally but we break off a diamond in here so that's what I mean it literally and that's hard to get focused on but it literally breaks into diamonds so beautiful stuff let me get it I'll just break that up for you right there it's literally just like a pile in diamonds but I'm definitely not gonna take that because it would [ __ ] kill me I'm gonna break off a nice piece of the sauce something diamond I have tickets to the burner concert to be going to so there you go all right one second grab the rig and we're ready to go keeping it real x-factor right here because we have hit the x-factor right here it's ready to go diamond sauce that kosher Kush and your kosher life keeping a kosher hitting at one sitting at twice here we go [Music] but that stuff is some of the best around all right you breathe do a lot better all right so the review on the flavor on that gives you chills it's not good it is sometimes and smell the flavor it's all the same there's no real difference just a lot of lemon I would not a lot of them and more of just like an OG flavor is what you're gonna get out of that kicks like [ __ ] like a [ __ ] the hike is like a roller coaster it just straight goes up and up and up and you don't know when it's gonna end and when you're gonna drop and usually when you do drop you are asleep for a while but that's my review on the end diamond sauce I'm gonna quote this on 21 but I'm gonna put it as diamond sauce that comes up for anybody else hasn't seen my videos check it out review on dabs but thank you for watching review on dabs it's in diamond sauce review let's get a good focusing on that shade right come on there we go shot a go coast that's what [ __ ] right there get one more picture is amazing I would guess the percentage on that maybe around like I feel like it's definitely in the 90s I'm not gonna shot glass and the right there's no doubt we got the ask but good [ __ ] shout out thanks for watching these like that", "KH011aczvvY": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'll change back again for another concentrate review today actually riding solo this time but I just thought I'd come through take couple dabs of the gas see what's good with this raw garden and farm cookies I don't think I need to talk too much about cookies warm cookies obviously as many you guys know is the form cut from way back in the icy mag days but you know obviously we've been smoking cookies for quite a long time done a ton reviews on this one on delve too much into that side of it raw garden is somebody that you know you've been seeing a lot on the scene in California the last year too especially for the live resin especially below and are not necessarily low in but the budget stuff I know we do a lot of crazy concentrate reviews sometimes you guys are asking us to you know go find the hypest [ __ ] that we can find and review it whatever the you know crazy new [ __ ] is sometimes you know some people just want to see good deals stuff that's affordable you know I mean so we're trying to review stuff that kind of hits you know all levels of the spectrum this stuff right here as we go open it up good color right away I mean as as is typical with the most live residents usually gonna be a pretty light color it's not always you know what I'm gonna go on as far as you know appearance with with some wide but going in on the nose here it's actually sweeter than I was expecting it's it's kind of really sweet not as much of the cookie thing in there it's not you know doughy it's not doesn't have that that cookie funk that you know we've all become accustomed to but it's definitely a little bit sweeter than I'm used to for form compete yeah that's interesting I'm excited to see what it dabs like so this stuff is you know a single source whole plant run I'm pretty sure it's clean green certified and obviously whatever that means these days you know a pretty basic packaging just comes on a little box with a childproof jar inside on the side says 100% raw cannabis keep refrigerated or frozen clean green certified your single source grown and extracted for you recommended use vaporize at low temps it also says the score the fridge which is uh good advice see this nails heating up here raw garden I want to say they've been around for a while I wanna say 2012 may be 2011 so they definitely been in a game for a minute I never really you know saw them you know really take off until they started doing this this live resin a year to go and like I say for the budget stuff for if you're looking for you know maybe not the most exotic maybe not the most flavorful but good bang for your buck as far as you know actually getting you high I feel like they're usually pretty good bet obviously the flavor on some of these can be hit and miss but in general you really can't go wrong on cookies I want to see what it tastes like [Music] okay there's a little cookie tube in there a little bit it's again a lot sweeter like I was thinking with going with the smell the taste is is sweet like I was expecting I definitely got a little bit more of that cookie kind of hint on the flavor than I did with the smell it's almost like a little earthy afterwards I don't know it definitely does leave you an interesting aftertaste on YouTube so I'll be right back I guess I'm going to need a checklist for these videos from now on I usually get all my [ __ ] together and double and triple-check but somehow I forget q-tips nine times out of ten the prior being a STONER I guess yes you know I'm off the first dab you know I'd say it's pretty good not really feeling a super immediate head change I think we need one more really capture the full effect but uh Jerry and Batman seem to be feeling it [Music] Aurum cookies are really any cookies in general is something that you know is always kind of a staple for me because it's generally something that you can smoke pretty much any time of the day morning noon or night obviously that's why it's been a staple a lot of people's you know smoke stash for quite a few years now I feel like it's just it's just a good working high you know I mean you can you smoke it you feel it but it doesn't make me want to lay on the couch necessarily it doesn't make you want to get up and run around the block necessarily either but you know I mean just burn everyday smoke you know being able to rotate through all the different cookie cuts that are out there is never a bad thing alright let's go down another one here I'm gonna take this one a little hotter just for fun I'm gonna do that Cheers [Music] that might be a bad idea that one was a little rough I feel like you got the job done I'm definitely feeling the head change now in general this raw garden stuff or any you know cheap budget oil which is what I would call this this stuff was let's see 35 bucks a gram so I mean depending on what state you're living in now prices are all over the place that could be a breezy expensive if you're living in a couple of sticks that could be super cheap if you're living in other states and I mean for out here for 35 bucks a gram I feel like with most things you just got to have a good eye about it I mean you got to pick and choose so all in all I'd say you know it's not the the best libraries and I've ever had I'd say this particular batch you know it's decent for paying 35 bucks a gram especially for out here you know obviously markets and these different legal states are all over the place right now so 35 bucks might be kind of steep or super cheap depending on where you're at but you know for 35 bucks out here I feel like bang for your buck it's a pretty good deal all right I'm lit up like a [ __ ] Christmas tree I need to get out of here thank you guys for joining me for another episode of the CCC I'm ashamed [Music]", "Xr26WRfCdgA": "YouTube what's up cuz you cared [ __ ] you push you here make sure y'all stand safe watching their hands and the whole nine yards and staying home we went to the dispensary today and grabbed cherry diesel diamonds from Gigli I've got diamonds I've had them but I knew I knew had any from them I already did a lot of video on so if you've seen that you see them already but if not check them up spinning cherry diesel diamonds one fifty two percent THC ninety seven point 57 th CA not much here because there's really no taste of these things for real I did over them and do a DAB on my live today you're gonna see that I really didn't get to feel close up look at that's an Easter present right there that one is an egg my soul and chunks like the grassroots ones they were more like that little flakes over there but these are nice [Music] it is clean it just died Brown's row [Music] only do the trick I would definitely grab a mess if you never did down into the Fords it's a definitely you know trying if your dad were and never did diamond to definite power tribe but if you're looking for taste it's just not there and last okay Cresco got the diamonds with the Terp sauce no that's a different ballgame you get the taste because you're getting a taste from the turf but I know the name is from the strain but there's no no tasting them down definitely take another dogs and gives you a little sweat up usually on like 87 and to get a good dab was but hey guys rocked up got tons of [ __ ] coming up the max I just put on yesterday never cured butter coming up and but you guys brought subscribe like comment see how to bar in the comments", "vDz6bMTdPDE": "alright guys this is my second video figured I would do it over viola my man want to call every brand my favorite company but Buell is a pretty interesting one founded by a former NBA player al Harrington back in 2011 got its name because that's his grandmother's name she suffers from glaucoma and diabetes and reluctantly agreeing from a long time of him persuading her helped her a lot and she now medicates with his help from viola and cool story great company all butane extracts I have a nice little flavor assortment recent pickup from Denver big fan so I'm gonna run you through a couple of these flavors actually I'm gonna go through all of them just because I'm reviewing viola today so first we have tangerine hash plant now some of these I have written to two grams on them because I combined them so no yeah I'll say that this one is one of my favorites which I probably say about four of them super citrusy flavor definitely getting the tangerine flavor and I got three of them they're incredible I love tangerines but each each it's gonna be to each his own what you think ghosts domina that's gonna be a live sugar 98 percent THC a and that total totally THC 86 percent you gotta look at that big difference with that live sugar it's a it's pretty easy to work with ghosts domina my girlfriend said it was her favorite fantastic that's another one of the two grams and I've been I've been small a little bit of these because I couldn't I couldn't wait to make this video my pay my patience is not there yet this was cool it's a life crumble and my girlfriend rated all these I agree oh this one's number one sour bean it just smells like sour if you if you can understand what that like a Sour Patch Kid like kind of makes you want to wrinkle your nose up haven't try that one yet Mac cake one of my favorites obviously if I got two grams of it been hitting it already no mmm super pungent another sour flavor that's what I love about viola I'll say like I said many of my hey many of these companies are my favorites but they each specialize and have their own qualities violas especially is the pungently sour flavors [Music] another one is called extra citrus where's that one right here so this one tangerine hash plate and lemon Lotus and key lime pie combined to make extra citrus a 94% THC a I smoked a lot of this one because look at some of those big diamonds Wow smell is undescribable just extra citrus they named it well it smells like like just sniffing a lemon juice jar from the store this one's called THC a witch that's literally the name of the strain I guess is Kim for the wipers or is it just THC a camphor don't know big rocks smells pretty pungent fruity though very fruity very nice this is a smooth one pretty good no they're all pretty similar on those numbers live sugar try dog cush makes a triangle cushion underdog again pretty soon one little number yummy wondered on how to hit that one yet in five days eighty-eight percent that was a little lower total THC at seventy-seven but a little darker which lots of sauce very flavorful oh yeah that one's a little I want to say almost Darla key kinda sour garlicky moonshine haze fantastic [Applause] gorilla dog that's a huge one no no these oh that one smells so different like that's the it's it's just quite a spectrum and it's incredible how different the flavors can smell 83-73 so everyone knows that the higher the percentage I guess the less of the flavor and that one smacks me in the smack to me in the face with the 73% and makes sense yes this one's the last one to buy batter it's much a little bit of that one you can see it herbal like that hahaha but really good um I hope you've watched my video about the peak and its upgrades and I pretty much exclusively smoke out of the peak now which I know a lot of you guys are gonna roast me for it but hey we're gonna we're gonna do a little bit of this ghost domina blue that's the ghost domina and we're smoking on the fade space str2 unum nitride insert that's in my first video all about the upgrades of the peak and I'm gonna superheat it that's my method of superheating so much flavor again that was on blue the lowest heat setting I'm gonna begin on red or green even but yeah that's my man I guess what do you think I should try maybe some of the sour bean laughs crumble throw it in there on the second Heat we just add a little bit more flavor do it again Wow Wow al Harrington viola well done I'm in citrus paradise th citrus and there are so many flavors I could hardly pick I hope you'll enjoy it subscribe if you enjoy these", "gHvCghsTxT4": "[Music] hey guys it's Cassie and Joe and today we're going to give you a little brief topic on fluorescence yeah a lot of times people ask us what is fluorescence they go down to the bottom of the certificate and fluorescence has nothing to do with the other aspects we talked about if it has a fluorescence indicator which let's look at the chart now it says none Hey faint medium strong very strong okay those are the monikers of fluorescence indicators so what is it it doesn't affect the cut it doesn't affect the polish of the cemetry per se so what is it well it does affect and can affect the overall look of the diamond and I stress can doesn't always affect it but it can and there's a general rule of thumb when you're looking to buy a diamond on what the fluorescence should be not always but should be and it should be on average with the really high color stones especially H and up the color is what we're focusing on here because that's the thing that it kind of affects its you want it to be none or faint occasionally medium doesn't even show up right so those can be fine as well but if you don't want to ever worry about it and pay a little bit extra money you get the nun or faint fluorescence and then when you start getting into JKL where you have a little more attentive yellow diamond it actually helps you and comes into play because that sort of blue comes into the yellow and almost like makes it appear whiter right so if you have like a faint fluorescence in a case tone it might look like an eye right and just to take a step back there because we're just explaining what fluorescence what is it well it's a react chin to UV light ultraviolet light so if you're going to the nail salon you put your nails in there oh my stove is fluorescent you would see way to a club otherwise D today you're not going to see anything right you may if it's strong or very strong it's possible but that might be helpful with what Cassie was talking about is if it's a lower color you paid a little bit less sometimes those stones with fluorescents are actually a little more money because it makes it look whiter in those instances so it's not always a bad thing it could be actually very helpful at times but on average most people if they don't want to even mess with it you know do I have to look for fluorescents as it affects my space barely ever get asked about it actually you get asked about more but for me it's not a big deal when I'm picking out a stone because I'm looking at other aspects I'm looking at the all-around like sparkle right and overall Sparkle which has nothing to do that bad right you could see the stone in person and the fluorescence medium or otherwise would be there and you don't it doesn't show up and you try it in different Lighting's it doesn't show up and that's great but we have the Liberty to do that so a lot of people don't want to do that all the time so they're like just I don't want none or faint and that's the easy way to do it I frankly agree with that if you like I don't want to mess with this but you have to look at the stone in person I think you've probably noticed I've brought that up many times so that's the truth you do we always go back to this is it's important when you go on the web and you check it some of these websites that have diamonds listed those are the diamonds a lot of times that we wouldn't buy they're gonna have fluorescence and they're gonna be the cheapest stones are gonna have strong blue fluorescence they're gonna show up they can show up horribly you might have the exception of stones that those are the ones that we've already picked out of the group but a lot of these stones that are online these websites Wow it's only let's say to the stone typically cost like six to seven thousand oh it's forty seven hundred dollars well there's a reason why yeah this reason why and one of those reasons and maybe triple excellent it may have great color but it has the strong blue and or very strong blue and that might make the stone look hazy cloudy it's all over the stone it shows up not only in UV but in every light Oh so that's what we're talking about maybe a little bit okay but once you get in the strong very strong if you can see it with all the different Lighting's that might affect the price greatly and that is our video", "bxQfKVwvlcM": "hello senior stoner fans I miss the real senior stoner back at you for a very very detailed discussion on the different type of THC a diamonds there are out there this time I'm gonna let you all see them and kind of whistle or Lurie touch them let's get started let's start with commercially packaged diamonds from manufacturers that really know what they're doing let's start with our excellent brand of live resin nug run diamonds they list batch numbers manufacturing dates THC content CBD content for the total active ingredient and they give you a little window on the bottom to look at your merchandise before you purchase it those diamonds have a very distinct color you can see the color it's not a light clear translucent color it's more of an opaque gold color if you will let's see if we can't take a closer look through the magnifier interesting the magnifier for you guys really isn't going to help us much let's get back to it this way so the key thing to look for I don't like a lot of sauce in mind you look for them to be relatively free of liquid liquids easy to lose you see even if I move to the next brand which is the SoCal diver I have two versions open for us to look at one is a sativa called neon lights on the left side and the other one is banana sorbet on the right side listening again their contents date of processing and cetera very organized very very legitimate way of knowing what you're getting and then when we get inside what we see inside of both packages is pretty cool both packages have large rocks of you can see the consistency here large rocks of diamonds this is another way of extracting and creating diamonds in the purest form you can see that these you can almost see through on the right side where in the left side it's almost opaque very important to note the difference because those are the different terpenes the different tools that these people help us medicate ourselves then you move over to what I call my contractor terpenes and what I design for myself these are made of mr. nice-guy strain and this consists of two granite but look at the consistency compared to the others look how almost if you will flowery it is it's very very open this is called an open-cell diamond what I want to hear was more surface area because I figured more surface area on the nail the better my combustion is going to be these I'm going to be using instead not on a nail or an electronic device I'm gonna be using these on the torch these are for the Rideau I might sometimes throw them on the email but mostly for the real and then we move over to my very specialized diamonds my dry diamonds I want to be very very specific about what these are these are sifted diamonds they're called and the grower doesn't even like to use them because they're not efficient well so be it the seniors daughter I use them on my Jimmy joints and they're just incredible it turns it up a notch even though I used to still within every joint it's an incredible enhancement for a joint then we go to some of my favorites these are TAC diamond TCA diamonds of gorilla glue number 4 made in a block you can see they're probably four or five pieces of the block inside these are really large chunks of diamonds and I keep these for my emails my earrings and things like that what you can see by this demonstration and discussion is that they're all really different when somebody says to you I can get diamonds I have diamonds you really need to ask questions especially since we need to a little bit understand cost let's understand cost everything on this table runs between ninety and a hundred dollars a gram so you have to be very specific when talking about it making a purchase ordering your medicine from a budtender because they might have a lot of different options and you want to make sure they dial it in the best way for you hope you enjoyed this discussion this is your sundae with diamonds have a great day", "R5uGi4EOHGw": "[Music] hello my friends welcome back to my channel diamonds and washi this is katie and if you're new here hi welcome i hope you'll consider subscribing if you liked today's video and if you are back welcome back today we are doing a post review of one of my latest completed projects and that is mighty river from diamond dots and their brand new square kit square drill kit line so look at the finished effect of this beautiful painting um look at the level of sparkle that diamond dots is very very much known for with their drills so this is actually the very first diamond dots kit i've completed at all not just my first square kit from them but as i mentioned the name of this one is mighty river which it does show here at the bottom the design size on this one is 52 by 34 centimeters it does measure true to size and it is legally licensed and this is a stock image that they licensed through shutter stock so diamond dots does legally license all of their images which is nice and um i was able to find this actually in store i was just walking through a joanne's which is a crafting and hobby store in the united states and saw that they had a few of diamond dots new square kits in stock and thought i would pick one up to give a try so this had 32 colors and one of those was an ab it was a white ab that is sprinkled very liberally through the sky here and through the river as well and i think adds just a nice little extra sparkle here i'll let you guys take a look up close if you're not familiar with what a b stands for it stands for aurora boreal aurora borealis and what that means is it's uh you can see how those drills there are extra sparkly and shiny um that just means that they've placed an extra coating on the top kind of an iridescent coating and sparkles even more than the regular drills already do sort of picks up the colors around it and has almost a little bit of a rainbowy effect that it throws off so i loved that in this kit i thought that that was a really really nice touch and really enhanced this kit quite beautifully speaking of the drills the drills in this kit were easily one of the very best things about it um diamond dots is known at least i had heard a lot about how they're known for having really really sparkly and really good quality drills that was absolutely the case for me even with their square kits so that's not just exclusive to their round kits there's very very little trash uh in the drills at all the abs i thought were especially nice um compared to maybe some other companies i felt like these this a b coating and i just accidentally popped a drill off there um the a b coating on those i thought was uh just a little bit more full than we see on some a b drills from other companies it just it coated it really nicely all over uh interestingly enough i had had several people warn me that in their experience diamond dot strolls were extremely staticky when they get up i had zero static when i kitted these drills up at all it was actually the least static i've had in my drills in quite some time so i don't know if they use a different manufacturer for their square drills or if it just was luck of the draw but i had no static issues with the drills that kitted up super quickly super easily while we're talking about drills um i mentioned this over on my instagram account but i want to show you guys here as well i noticed something super interesting about these drills when i was working on this kit so in case you weren't aware typically with square drills there are a couple of different ways that the top is cut that it's faceted really and it typically is cut there's usually two or three different ways that they'll cut the tops of the drills and it just has sort of the effect of giving a more i don't know overall sparkle i suppose maybe it's just part of the manufacturing process but with diamond drops square drills if you take a look look at the facets on the top they are identical on every single one of these drills i think it makes for a really fascinating effect and i like the overall effect and it's so striking because you don't see that in other kits let me show you the light drills as well they're all cut the exact same way on the top so i mean it might not necessarily be everyone's cup of tea but i really enjoyed the effect of it at least with this piece so that was interesting just thought i would point that out to you guys as well something else i enjoyed about this piece was just the overall finished effect i thought was nice especially for the size this is on the smaller side i thought the canvas was a nice material and i sort of i kind of liked this effect on the border where i don't know if diamond dots does this with all of their kits i know that dreamer designs does it with their kits but there's this border that's added on the side that i suppose is just to sort of give it a matted or framed look and just make it feel a little bit more complete it's a really interesting effect and i'm guessing you probably either love it or not so much i like it i think it works for this piece pretty well so um something else that i've mentioned this already but i'll mention it again just as far as something that i liked and what i like about diamond dots kits in general is one of the most important things to me about diamond painting kits is that they're legally licensed and not using unlicensed artwork from artists and essentially stealing from them so i really appreciate that all of diamond dot's artwork is licensed so i feel you know ethically good about what i am picking up and it's also a huge plus to me that you can get these kits in store diamond dots is one of those companies that is available at several retailers and it they even have availability at retailers in multiple countries if you go on the diamond dots website you can put in the country that you live in and it will give you a list of retailers and in the united states it's most crafting stores have diamond dots and um you can even order them online as well so let me get into some things that i had kind of a tough time with one of the things that a fellow diamond painter had mentioned having an issue with and i did have an issue with as well there's some gapping with the drills and i am a perfectionist this drove me a little bit crazy and i really tried to go back and center them really evenly um so that the gapping wasn't as noticeable but the reality is these drills just did not sit tight at all they uh there's no satisfying click when you pop them together you know filled in the gaps um and there just is visible gapping it's especially noticeable on those light colors like the whites so it's almost like the drills themselves were just a tiny bit too small or the charting was just a tiny bit too large and i would be interested to see that i know square drills are brand new to diamond dots if they continue to you know produce kits and do additional runs i would definitely be interested to see if they could tweak that just a little bit so it's a more overall uniform look because you can even see the gapping down here so at a distance which is kind of a bummer but i mean hopefully it's just a learning curve for them uh something else that was really tough for me was that they're the dark cymbals in the blues especially uh were extremely saturated in particular uh this symbol basically the dark blues uh and even some of the dark greens were saturated to the point of being blurry and frankly it there was a lot about this kit that was giving me really strong deja vu for dreamer designs it's not a bad thing i just i've noticed multiple things about this kit that maybe go is this these the same manufacturers streamer designs i'm actually going to insert a side-by-side picture that i took here of a dreamer designs kit that i own um and the symbols on that kit next to the super saturated symbols on this kit so you could take a look and see kind of what i mean it's that similar effect where it just it kind of hurts your eyes to look at and it's hard to be able to distinguish between the symbols um and kind of yeah be able to tell what you're seeing on the canvas so so one other thing that i was a little on the fence about was um it's nice that they have this border here but this is just a personal preference thing so i'm used to the glue spilling out a bit past the drill field this is poured glue which is nice um but since there was a border there that i didn't really want to cover up with washi tape um it would have been nice if the glue could have been cut just a bit closer to the drill field itself because i definitely found like down here i was getting like fuzz and stuff stuck in that over spill so i ended up putting washi tape i could have done this from the start i suppose i ended up covering it in washi tape while i was working on it and then took off the washi tape after it was finished um but i would still worry depending on how you hung it or framed it if it wasn't behind glass that it would catch dust and stuff and not look very clean so you could take an x-acto knife and cut that and then remove it but that's you know depends on how diy and crafty you're feeling i suppose that is an option so um then just a couple of thoughts on diamond dots in general as far as things that are make me hesitant to buy from them again though i will buy from them again if some artwork speaks to me um one of the things i'm hesitant about is that the artwork that they have available tends to be really sort of limited in options it's uh you either you know have find a lot of things that you love in their artwork like they have a lot of like pets or florals or basic landscapes like this that are uh pretty they have animals um i don't really see them branching out much into like artists artwork it's a lot of more i think stock style photos which is really beginner friendly um and you know i think i love that they're available in stores but i wish that they had a little bit more variety in their selection um and that being said the price point i feel like can be a little bit on the higher side though at least in the united states like when i got it at joann's i got it with a coupon like a 40 or 50 percent off coupon and that made the price point you know much more manageable for me um but i've you know from what i've heard from my international subscribers the price point for diamond dots seems to be a little bit higher because they don't necessarily have access to coupons so i think you kind of have to just look at their selections see if there's something that is speaking to you um and sort of keep in mind that at least with their square drills like i said i haven't worked with their round drills like i said the canvas was really saturated in terms of the symbols and um but the drill quality was really good really sparkly and i love all the abs this is really fun to work on honestly so one thing that i do want to note um because i know this comes up often for people that are working on diamond dots if you save your spare drills when you're done with the project uh diamond dots is different from most other companies if not all their companies and that they use their own proprietary numbering system so and they call it it's a dots they say dq number i'm actually not sure what that stands for but this color this number corresponds to specific colors so the nice thing is diamond dots actually just recently added to their website a conversion chart from the diamond dots codes to dmc so when i go to save these drills while i'm going to keep them in their own separate baggies because of the nature of them that they're all faceted the same way i can at least still put them with their respective dmc code that they go with by looking at that conversion chart and putting in like okay what is 8146 in dmc or the closest two so um if that's something that you want to be able to see i will link the conversion chart in the description below i'll also link this kit on the joann's website below as well as the unboxing that i did of this kit just a week ago um this worked up really quickly it took me just four days i think to finish um there was some color blocking this was mostly confetti and there was a lot of confetti here but there was a decent amount of color blocking and this is a smaller kit so it did work up quickly but feel free to go take a look at the unboxing if you'd like to have a closer look at the canvas before it was complete and hear my thoughts on everything there so what are your guys's thoughts have you ordered from diamond dots before and or tried their square drill kits and if not do you think that's something that you want to try uh either based on this video or otherwise uh and what are your overall thoughts on this finish and some of the overall feedback that i shared with you guys on my experience um as always leave any questions comments or concerns down in the

like I said we've never done it before but it's gonna be something we sit on you mentioned start implements is my new mentally startup at all yes today's all about rody Roz if you haven't seen that already Roby rosin rody Rossi somebody has and bonanza he brought gifts Rhode Island's finest garden rody rosin collab t-shirts trial run we got it all so some of these shirts right here will be pumping these out in the next few weeks and maybe think of some pretty sale order it's doing a little campaign we got some merchandise we got stickers so we're trying to roll out get the diamonds I've ever seen never seen anything like this number whatever shaped that's first for the community man around here UFC Octagon literally I won't tell your next to go octagon things yeah honeycomb to the dome I like that all right man let's get it written how we doing it so we starting off with a little warmup it's a member very flattered rosin I'm the Barry Slough member Barry's my favorite shape for any shape or form in Larry's not well obviously crazy the live loss is crazy the diamonds grew it what's good setting the record over here straight remember Barry's always finest Gardens they grow it we got it right here and only home diamonds so that's a druid row with rh- Gardens everyone knows about them of course then we got Mission Hill melts who washes the flour all right oh [ __ ] yeah so this is a Mission Hill he comes in he watches it he gives me some of that premium bubble ash full spectrum then I go from there I'll take that I turn into the honeycomb diamonds they're testing right around like 90% DHT oh [ __ ] yeah that's something not too many not too many companies around Lake 7ds high 60s right 64 and what's nice about these men the only clean diamonds the individually proportion solely you can take one of them and you know how much it dig and they each weigh like a point zero six grams okay so like you can go it's like easy to measure yeah I started just coming out couples and happy well like you know with the Terps once they soak up makes a little easier to break up spinning per usual toke tonic in the rig shout out talk tonic and yo we will write about the sour berries sour berries has a lineage from them if they have a berry sauce sour berries is fire no games started so when did you start when did you create rody rosin and winning this whole when did the whole idea behind us start what made you say this is what I want to do yeah so how I started I guess so rody rosin started from when I first began making extracts back in 2013 ok oh it was kind of like I used to solving these butane so it was back when like butane was you know being in the community and so I started in my experience through that I'll get some trim I blasted I guess an extract and I realized at that point like you know you got like this nice concentrated oil in a pure form right and for me I was a patient so I interested in the industry being a patient I got Lyme disease so I had some chronic pain that I needed to manage you know smoking flour the smoke itself was just you know it was hindering my life you know healing process for Lyme disease doctors you know too much smoke villages not healthy for me so you got a reaction from like a Dewar's puffer blunt like it it wasn't good I wasn't talking too much you know I mean I have like my sinus together stuff there's something like that you know just because of the line busy how it have these exaggerated responses to the smoke so I ended up going towards you know the - yeah you take one hit it's like smoking I hope you're good to go yeah it's all I needed so I took a little hit yeah realize how medicinal it was right it was working for me so I figured why not bring this medicine to the people around patients around me I'm sort of like to hear man it's all about so I started working with B&B consultant if you guys are familiar with that but they do they are they do medical cards around here over here that Warwick and I worked with him as patients and like he gave me some patients that were in chronic pain and you know from there kind of like develop and at one point I realized like hey I can go from using this solvent that having a solvent list by just going from rosin you just get in the buzz and just squashing it was like the main guys you're working with yeah so basically I mean the industry is real competitive there's no and having the best product out there is and pulling high quality stuff and you know I found myself you know working with our eyes finest Gardens they seem to have something like the most high quality high quality flower out there and I think we can also attest to that it's definitely this fire there's nothing better than pressing some high quality flower on that much and I've worked with LC problems they're a women-owned cultivator okay all right so they sell the VI Vancouver Island A's so press some of some of their stuff I work with them great people over there and but right now I'm just focusing with our eyes finest gardens and you know seeing what happens next in the industry more or less right right distinctly every other diamond looks like it's not uniformly shaped like that already right it's like that the only ones I see now perfect like octagon shapes you have any shape you want it yeah I mean I could go that route 100% I can make any any shape I want and that's something we're thinking about right now maybe getting something that represents Rudy rosin but yeah so each one of those honeycombs are point zero six grams so I mean it helps do consumer understand what the you know what they're consuming and I think that which is the first time I like other than even edibles right I have history edibles were like summer week and someone like ungodly strong wave and it's like it's like the pan tilted to the left and all the good cherry be like the ones to the top right a week and one that is leaning towards it's just the most ungodly [ __ ] edible and I mean be done and I mean that's good exactly that's what's good about this because it gives you like that better understand them [Music] in 2006 320 comme no people with 90 percent THC or even 70 percent THC rosin you know it's important to know what you know in your hand in their wedding cake in their purple chemistry imma let a good guy me too I love the guess I like somebody though it sounds like their staple but like the can for sure this it's like you know you can you can try this you can try that what pecans oh it's right there exactly so you been know you've been in the community sorry since since when I was medicated because I like Lyme disease before my patient card 2008 2009 yes right around when I started burning flour saying that 2008 it was like an eighth grade like that transition into my best on that kid so I'm that kid I smoke weed in like high school wrong with this [ __ ] without getting pulled over I should probably spend the money on it exactly did that right away I was like oh wait I can grow weed I was like we should probably do that and I did that right away he did push first tried cannabis back in like eighth grade but then I really started medicating it was a big gap in time where I wasn't using it and then towards the end of high school like made its way back around other guys this stuff actually works for some reason right right doctor job they were trying to beat me like all regards just a prescription medication I they shouldn't be given you know kid at my age right sprays you know whatever I know it's like you have to take the life that young it's your how old 27 how old were you when you found out this news that's legit when I in your whole life like when I take it when I like that and I had trouble for you know it was like so the b-17 like to remember that stage of my life and then to be like you have Lyme disease just again right you know I'm saying that's crazy I had Stage three heart so I was like it was going down it was going down dude I had like my hands were inflamed my angels were inflamed my nose and eyes were inflamed I couldn't I really couldn't move my hands it was that if you like my tics and [ __ ] I never found the tape what like that you know they said I got it from a tick and uh that's what they said yeah yeah do it I walk my dog and I was taking Matt takes off and I was like I gotta check neat oh hell yeah it's no joke so I started I got control of my health kind of how I didn't totally taken no cannabis instead of doing those prescription medications hell yeah I do the same thing I had emergency surgery on my stomach and I was like maybe 25 and I was in the hospital I know no idea why they [ __ ] cut me open sold me up did wherever the [ __ ] I had an ulcer and I was like literally poisoning myself but then when I got out he was like you gotta take this purple pill from life right and I was like like no like I was just like no way no what I can't even take I'm like I'm not gonna wake up everyone I'm gonna forget that I can never if I had to take birth control be pregnant already they're gonna say cuz I would never remember that pill that be morning I would just walk out and be like let's go you know just not in me to like wake up every morning and take a pill like that that was never gonna happen so like I took them cuz I knew I just got out of surgery but then as soon as I felt like I was healed I didn't even tell the doctor and then I I told I want to take this no more it was like don't take them for a week let me know let you go right now I don't know yet see ya who's like if you're good you're good I was like whoa haven't talked since it's been like [ __ ] five years that's what's good bro you know you get stronger you get out there they make the right moves can be so catastrophic dude so people don't realize it they just because it's like government approved that like it's okay that's the whole inception about do wheat itself from all the day to the hemp days where hemp was gonna overtake paper you know I mean when they and they shut that down to like literally now we're like CBD is threatening the health care system now they're trying to manage ourselves and how we trying to make savings if you can grow CBD on the value back watching the Sun like you know you're not you don't have to get tylenol or whatever the [ __ ] oh yeah I miss all that obsolete yeah I can just grow a tomato and eat a tomato I don't have to go to the supermarket same thing with CVD whose grow CBD and make your emotions from it whatever the [ __ ] you wanna make fun which is you know this concentrates aspect it's a big thing because they're realizing that it's a pure reform I mean you get rid of all the impurities all those botanical impurity you think about the clarity on these [ __ ] diamonds man I'm just hoping that I get the temperature right on my back it's gonna piss me off is keep cold piss me off yeah because the tha just brings a little bit higher like the portions are [ __ ] awesome too because like when I'm again getting a [ __ ] dab ready I'm like that's too much you got to put a little bit back this one's just grabbing you go don't go it's [ __ ] growers only cold collaboration with roadie rosin like I said we've never done it before here we go remember babies solve over B rosin solving this diamonds saw stuff was that cap a break I'm digging that here man that's a new rig - I like that that curly fry THCA there's a lot of people yeah yeah like normally people have lag on thta customs like stable like you get some rosin this flavor from the member berries which is always the best apologies comes back the way it Elita member parity look it's the perfect size you don't need that you need is a second guess how was that it's funky [Music] [Music] yeah so real quick you know just to inform the community about the uncle diamonds the way these are me there's a couple way make the diamonds you can make them by the jar text or you can make mechanical separation those are like the two two texts right now and the way these were made or mechanical separation and recombination so basically with what definitely Chinese to me right now and I'm like what's that what that is you literally get the rosin and you repress it so it starts from live rosin rosin high-quality flour so that's we get so that's good we just are that's a basis so they you got like 20 grams of like some some rods and high quality stuff to test around like 70 percent THC mm-hmm good daddy throw it in some like 25 micron screens double wrap it and make sure they're nice and safe and you go and you put it in the press and like it's this real slow meticulous process with like idle low temperature low pressure you sit there and you kind of just like allow the terpenes and cannabinoids the kind of like separate from one another the THC a crystallizes as like a place closed and the heat is applied to it and they're slowly closing the terpenes won't like push off to the side and like folded parchment paper and like kind of like collected turkeys into a separate jar which you got the terpenes you got the THC a you can kind of do another little magical process to it after and then you go and then we combine the terpenes with the Diamonds so so you do the KFC recipe the locked-up recipe you ain't tell me nobody and yeah very nice you're gonna keep that there's a lot there's a few things I wasn't even on yeah definitely yeah you know meticulous process and it takes like a great quality flour and I'm good material to watch just like when you grow flowers everything from the soil to the [ __ ] nutrients but everything has to be perfect if you want to get the best like is it different quantities you're getting out per restraints or yeah so like you know it's Oh princess you're gonna press like rosin you know and you press in like 10 grams of flour rosin you know each strain it's gonna give you a different percent yield like this one strain might yield twenty percent and you got yourself off ten grand you got yourself two grams you got one string that may yield 10% and then off 10 grams you got yourself one gram right so like that's the difference in like working with the different string in Yukon a half there yo put that into account calculate you know like you said finding that right string for some screens you like to work with I haven't won this whole time all right the time has arrived for the first time ever the 90 second burned down so rapid-fire questionnaire we're gonna ask the questions you're gonna answer them as quick as your [ __ ] possibly can just go home see your brain it doesn't have to be a and as soon as you're done exhaling the dad I'm gonna start asking all right I like it 90 seconds burn down let's go smoking on his own creation all right here we go nice question indica or sativa once bones joints smoke solo and smoke with friends Fred Family Guy or The

compassion center exclusive TV check them out we burn heavy taste [Music]", "envlRMIvEmI": "[Music] greetings youtubers this is Matt from girdle gold in this video we're going to be focusing on high pressure high temperature diamonds also known as HP HT diamonds these diamonds are mined from the earth and it goes through a process that actually simulates natural earth conditions to make the diamond look whiter than when it was taken from the ground which is really cool so let's take a look at it and dip into it so now we're looking at the Diamonds labs certificate and first and foremost you're going to see that it's GI a graded in my opinion GI is the most recognized diamond laboratory in the world they are very reputable as well so how can we tell if the diamond has gone through the HP HT process well there's a few ways for one if i zoom into the diamonds color grade you're going to see an asterisk next to the color of E and if I go down below to the inscription you're going to see that it actually says treated color that's going to be inscribed on the girdle of the diamond totally microscopic and below that it says this diamond has been treated by one or more processes to change its color now G IA recognizes and grades these diamonds because the process is irreversible once the color is upgraded it can't go back all right so this is going to be probably the highlight of the video and on the right you see a GI a graded F color diamond and what I'm going to do is bring in to the scene the color diamond that we've been looking at and this one is the HP HT diamond and you're going to see it's actually lighter than the F color diamond as it should be now next I'm actually going to use the GI a graded ecology Minh that's non HP HT just to compare alongside the e color that is H PhD the diamond on the Left let's do that now so this is the HP HT e and here comes the GI a graded non-hp HT e and you're gonna see they look awfully similar I really see no noticeable difference in terms of color it's pretty much dead on that's really cool to see and now we're going to take a look at the diamonds level of brilliance and how it looks compared to non HP HT diamonds the diamond is seeing right now is that 1.3 Evie vs 1 HP HT diamond I'm going to bring in the 1.3 f vs 1 non HP HT diamond and you'll see regarding brilliance the HP HT diamond definitely holds its own that's really because it's cut with maximum light return what we do is we sort through the HP HT diamonds and handpick the ones that visually look comparable to the hearts and arrows diamonds out there regarding brilliance now the HP HT diamond on the right that's a vvs1 most of the HP HT diamonds will be via Stu's or greater and that's because they're put under such extreme pressure and temperatures that diamonds with larger inclusions are actually prone to exploding under the conditions they're placed in and just like in the earth nothing is added or removed from the natural diamonds crystal during the process and now we're viewing the diamonds using natural daylight the GI agreed at 1.3 f vs 1 hearts and arrow diamond is on the left and the 1.3 Evie vs 1 HP HT diamond is on the right HP HT diamonds usually come in deep through a chin collar and they're pretty rare and that's because only 2% of the diamonds coming from the ground qualified to go through the HT HP process and that's because they need to be typed to a diamonds those are diamonds that don't contain nitrogen and last but not least let's talk about cost so for instance the 1.3 vvs1 that one's coming in at around 8,000 if this were is non HP HT a diamond with the same stats would be closer to 15,000 so you're getting a GI a graded earth grown diamond that to the human eye will look almost double the cost compared to what you'd really be spending and once again the process is irreversible now just like with GI a triple excellent diamonds keep in mind that not all each PhD diamonds will be this brilliant but if interested you could get these diamonds cherry-picked for you here at good old gold but more importantly we're just informing you of what's available out there in the diamond world we never did a video on this topic yet so there you go thanks for watching you", "4iloC38zxAo": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] you greetings and welcome to this episode of my nose school of rock today we are going to be learning about one of the most fundamental technologies that we employ when we're doing an examination on light performance and diamonds it is one of three analog optical examinations that we perform when we're looking at any given diamond that we're going to be taking into our inventory and this read this technology that we're gonna be exploring today is what we would generally refer to as red reflector technology okay which encompasses three tools one that has gained a lot of popularity on the internet and is called an ideal scope okay it's this little tool here with them has like a little pink cap on it on top is a a glass magnifier we're using the expensive ideal scope they sell a few different versions of the ideal scope which you can get at ideal scope comm okay women talking about the fire scope fire scope is a desktop model the original invention was created back in 1985 and patented which the patent has run out on it we happen to be one of the only stores in the country that possess an original fire scope they're not readily available and very few gemologists have an actual fire scope and I'm also gonna be discussing to an extent our own little creation after using the fire scope for a year we invented something to show us the details that we see through these tools a little more effectively and is the technology and photography we feature on our website called diam x-ray okay so three primary red reflectors on the market ideal scope fire scope and Diane Mex ray all right now the usage of these tools is really very simple and very basic and it's in it's common to all of them the idea is to take the diamond in question [Music] hold it at the bottom of the red reflector and looking through the crown of the diamond we're gonna reflect the pink plus the shadow of our eye into the crown of the diamond pink plus the shadow of our eye going in should be pinky and the shadow of our eye coming out or pink and black in should be pink and black out as long as the facets on the bottom of the diamond are properly reflecting back to the viewer what's going into it okay sounds simple and yes it is very simple we're literally looking at the physics of light as it travels in a diamond and out of a diamond okay when we're giving a presentation to our clients in the store we will generally describe this as the examination of mirrors and windows all right now the facets on the pavilion of a diamond are gonna function in one of two different roles they're either gonna function as mirrors or reflectors of light or windows which allow light to escape through the bottom they shine a flashlight in a mirror light in His light out find a flashlight in a window light passes through the window so this examination under these red reflectors I solely think of it as an examination of how the pavilion facets are functioning not necessarily the crown facets but the pavilion facets okay so those pavilion facets are either gonna function as mirrors or windows reflectors of light or leakers of light okay so when we put a diamond like this under the ideal snow pink and black going in should be painting black coming out it's pretty easy to understand once you get a hold of it all right the ideal scope just some few words on the ideal scope the ideal scope is a great handy little tool it's fantastic because it's portable you could bring it anywhere with you if you get the glass Virgen they sell them in both glass and plastic the glass absolutely you know it's a pretty good quality magnifier and allows you to pretty easily see what it is you're looking at the the limitations of this handheld version is as you bring this thing from you know if you shopping with it using it in jewelry stores if you bring it from jewelry store the jewelry store lighting changes in jewelry store and the fact even in the same environment if I look at a diamond at this angle here and I'm aiming the back of the diamond towards the illumination of my front windows I get one view when I just move the diamonds over where the lighting is different in the store I can get a different view so your views aren't going to always be consistent from store to store as you even may be looking at the same diamond alright but you know just like anything else practice makes perfect you look at enough diamonds with this and eventually you know you'll get the hang of it and it's why we really turn to desktop models like the fire scope and even more particular our dynamics ray technology because it uses a consistent source of backlit illumination ok here's a little more detail on the fire scope you see that's it you know we could use batteries or electricity you have a nice consistent cool white light source here that was gonna be behind the diamonds okay here is your lens which is a 10x magnifier with adjustable focus on the optics high high quality 10 power lens when we screw this off we have underneath a pink reflector okay and underneath the hood that it screws into is more pink reflector so when we're doing the examination under the fire scope the diamond in question is being passed on this reflector and we're going to be using this now in this particular presentation although the photography that you're going to see on the screen is going to be photography under our diam x-ray technology okay now the first part of this visual tutorial on on red reflectors is going to be pointing out one of the strengths of this technology and the strength of it being that of being able to see very clearly how much light leakage exists in a diamond because how much light that leaks out of the diamond is going to impact its visual performance alright and and so step number one here the positive aspects of red reflectors and and of course I'm biased towards my own creation and I am x-ray but it's going to show us very critically light leakage within the diamond and how it's going to impact the visual performance of the diamonds now just before we start looking critically at diamonds I want to familiarize you with something that we personally hand-picked for our own inventory this is a diamond that qualifies that is GI a excellent it also has a GSI deal light performance it's light performance falls in a category that is amongst the rarest in the world in fact when you couple its precision with its light performance constitute less than 1% of diamonds cut in the world alright the diamonds that constitute our signature arts and arrows inventory and this is what the diam x-ray image looks like of one of our signature diamonds my fact here's a video first of it under the fire scope the same tool I'm using okay and now here is a photograph under our diam x-ray technology okay so this diamond here you'll notice solid reds and blacks me indicating that all the facets on the bottom of the diamond are effectively reflecting back out all the red and black that's going into it and that's good because we're going to drop the Bucks on the diamonds we want to make sure all the facets on the pavilion are functioning like mirrors okay so this right here is an optical signature that okay that is beautiful now the next time in we're pulling on to the screen is another GI a excellent in the cut quality all right and as you notice the difference between this image and the one you just saw in effect there they are both on the screen for you to see you're gonna notice two primary differences one is this one has a more chaotic optical design while the other one was more symmetrical that has to do with issues of craftsmanship though not light performance but you'll also notice White's underneath the table now okay and all those areas of white are places where we can see through the facets back to the white behind the diamonds because all those areas there that you see that are white our areas that are leaking light okay so when light is leaking it's not being returned to the eye and it's gonna impact the optics now a similarity between these two diamonds notice that it does have little bits of white around the perimeter those little bits of white around the perimeter is where small bits of leakage is happening but that is not extraneous light leakage in other words it's so tiny that you're really not going to discern it with human vision all right the primary difference though is that leakage that's occurring in the most sensitive part of the diamond and that's right under the table facet all right now we're gonna stop right here actually and I'm gonna disappear from your screen for a second I want to show you a visual comparison between these two GI a excellent cut grade diamonds okay and here on the screen you're seeing in diffused lighting the visual differences between two GI a excellents one of them is a diamond that would constitute our own signature in our inventory a signature good old gold hots and a diamond alongside of another G excellent and if you're wondering if there's a difference in value between the two you better believe there is okay in fact if you go search on websites today and look at GI a excellence in the same carat weight clarity and color you'll see differences of thousands of dollars all right so you are learning right now one of the factors that constitute this difference in value which is what makes this video a very important one okay diffuse lighting and particularly the lighting setup that we have arranged for this video most effectively shows the visual differences that one is going to observe in cut qualities okay when we're primarily looking at the optical characteristics of brightness and contrast in diffused lighting and it's the most popular optical characteristic people will see in their diamonds on a daily basis so we place a heavy emphasis before we cut out to the next comparison though we're gonna look at them in spotlighting and show you the differences in fire and sparkle and let you see that also okay so take a look at that look at the differences and now we're gonna move on to the next one okay but we're always going to use as a standard of reference our signature diamond because it's optics of the rarest okay now this next time in that we're pulling on to underneath the reflector you're gonna notice this one also has a chaotic optical pattern and the leakage in this one is even more extraneous alright and this is a diamond that now goes out of the GI a excellent category and into the GI a very good as far as cut grade is concerned and here on the screen just for your own reference we're going to put the images of our signature stone let's just look at all three of them we'll put all three of them up there on the screen for you okay now I'm gonna kind of phase out again and show you the visual comparison between these three okay and look at the difference now in your diffuse lighting between our signature diamond the other GI a excellent and now this GI a very good this one has more leakage by the way obviously GI a is not critically examining leakage otherwise that what that one that got the excellent wouldn't get excellent but this is our own personal breeding of the optics of these diamonds utilizing this technology and demonstrating a great strength of this technology and examining light leakage okay so there's your visual differences between the three of them I got all three of them up on the screen there and now before we cut out you've seen that now let's cut out to spotlighting and let you just look at the comparison now between the three diamonds and spotlighting when we see when we take the Diamonds away from diffuse lighting and look at them in spotlighting we're looking at a completely different optical characteristic we're looking at fire and sparkle scintillation okay whereas in the diffuse lighting we were looking at brightness and contrast or pattern that scintillation alright okay and now for the last diamond as we head down the scale this diamond now is a GI a good on the cut scale and something that you're going to notice in this diamond you see your blatant areas of white under the table your light leakage under the table just like those other two diamonds but now this has additional light leakage and you can see those areas of white now around the perimeter are pretty pronounced as well okay so all that light leakage that's happening around the perimeter the die-cut perimeter of the diamond is also going to impact its optical properties as well so now I'm not going to be able to fit all four diamonds on the screen at the same time I can put three but before so what we'll do is we'll put this one I'm gonna shrink away again oh a phase away here is the the three that we just got done looking at and diffuse lighting okay now we're gonna slide this other one onto the screen and look at that look at the degradation in optics okay as we go from the best to the worst okay so as light leakage increases in the diamond than all those extraneous areas of light leakage the more the optics are going to be degraded and of course this is a value detractor with us and this diamond also just really suffers a decrease in fire and sparkle as well okay so his the now that you've seen it in a diffuse lighting here is the spot lighting [Music] okay all right so this wraps up this portion of the video demonstrating the strengths of red reflector technologies okay ideal scope if you get your hands on one it's a good tool to have if you're not doing business with somebody who provides that imagery fire scope even better the desktop model provides that consistent light source you're gonna see the scene from diamond after diamond and then of course our dime x-ray technology is just that's the pinnacle of red reflective technology to truce true second generation piece of equipment that really shows us critically the differences in light return versus light leakage alright so thank you for joining me on this portion of the video now we're going to enter into the next part of this video and that is the limitations of these technologies because this is that we're learning some good stuff but this is not an end-all be-all technology okay in this next portion of our program on red reflectors we've been now going to demonstrate some examples of why this technology while it's a great idea to have the information provided by this tool it's not an end-all be-all solution so we're gonna demonstrate some examples why alright and the first time in it we're gonna look at here is a diamond that we have in our inventory and you'll see as you look at the diam x-ray results on this you see a pretty solid red and black image hey it's optical design is different from you know our signature diamonds but you'll notice it's all red and black okay except for those little tiny white bits of lightly excuse me light leakage around the edges but again those are so small it's not discernible but the fact of the matter is all the facets on the bottom of the diamond here are effectively functioning like mirrors or reflectors of light now something that we're going to be covering in the next tutorial on a set is that while the facets on the pavilion on the bottom of the diamond can effectively be functioning as mirrors the mirrors are only going to be as bright as the crown facets are drawing in light from the brightest resources in the environment because you know if you have too much darkness going in a dime too much darkness in is too much darkness out so as you look at the visual comparison now of this diamond alongside of one of our signature diamonds okay as I phase away you're going to see a visual difference between these two and this is enough of a visual difference that caused this diamond to not get the GI a excellent cut great now even though GI a does not utilize this technology in their examination when they showed this kind of a diamond with these proportions next to something that you're looking at here 99% of the people looked at it said yeah that one's an eye I don't prefer that one to this one okay AGS gave this particular diamond a hit in brightness and contrast so that's why I'm primarily right now showing you the visual differences between these two diamonds and diffuse lighting okay now when we switch over to spotlighting you're gonna notice that this diamond looks pretty darn good and spotlighting and the truth be told when a diamonds pavilion facets are functioning effectively like mirrors and we look at them in the spot lighting environment they can produce great fire even when brightness and contrast suffer fire can still be excellent all right so is it possible for a diamond to have great fire and spa and not-so-good brightness and contrast the answer to that is yes [Music] now [Music] we're gonna move on to another diet okay this diamond has a little bit more better a little better optical design also solid red and blacks on the pavilion you know so all the facets are effectively functioning like mirrors okay but here's another diamond that takes a hit and brightness and in contrast in the AGS system and in the GI a system okay so red reflectance e you can look at a diamond under this tool and say wow this looks great and it still not be a visually stunning diamond in all lighting environments alright people will take diamonds like this sometimes they'll bring them outside into diffuse lighting and say you know why is this time and look dark wow it's reflecting back too much head and body shadow within the diamond we're gonna do a little bit more critical examination of this these other kinds of things in our next video tutorial tutorial on the a set okay so here is an example now this next one's going to really shot yeah I think because look at that this diamond has what a lot of people would consider a perfect red reflect their image its optical symmetry is dead-on in fact the optic the the symmetry and the craftsmanship of this diamond is on par with our signature hearts and arrows diamonds so it is a top of the line cut quality with regards to precision and look at this all the facets on the pavilion are effectively functioning like mirrors and reflecting light back out through the top so what in the world would disqualify this from getting a GI ax this diamond doesn't make GI a excellent okay and some of these don't even make a GS ideal either and this is gonna sound odd okay cuz you see how this diamond has Reds going all the way out from edge to edge so you think edge to edge light return right it's gonna be the best optics should be better optics and then a hearts and arrows right it's not necessarily the way the labs look at it and it has to do with not just the facets on the pavilion reflecting light back to the eye but where the crown is drawing in its reflections from okay so in any case let me just kind of phase out on the screen and show you the visual differences by the way this this feature that you see that's causing the solid red and black to go to the edges as a cutting characteristic that's cold painting okay and if if there's a girdle cutting characteristics that fall in the way of either painting or something that it's also described as digging by the way there are two different cutting things for the girdle it's in depth we have articles on the subject on our website if you want to read about painting and digging but they are cutting characteristics that will cause the diamond to not get a GI excellent but as we look at the two diamonds side-by-side on the screen and diffused lighting you can see more pronounced areas of darkness on the diamond that's painted okay now there are people who've seen this this kind of a diamond because this is not a badly cut diamond I don't want to give that impression that this is a badly cut timing because it's not some people see this and don't like it and Gi a survey that they did and in surveys that we've conducted there were a lot of people that didn't prefer the painted diamond some people this doesn't bother it doesn't you know in it they don't care they but they do like the fact that it's a solid red image we're not the ones to make that decision for you but I will say this a diamond it's gonna qualify as a signature diamond in my inventory must meet the highest standards with regards to G ia and AG s so because this time it doesn't make a GI a excellent it doesn't qualify as a signature diamond in our inventory but so there's you visual differences and brightness and contrast is your fire and sparkle now between this painted hearts and arrows diamond is the hearts and arrows diamond alongside of one of our signature hearts and arrow diamonds okay so all right now that we've looked at these three diamonds these three diamonds are excellent examples of why you can look at red reflector images alone and still not pick really what is deemed as G ia excellent AGS ideal or a diamond that they would deem is one with the highest optics okay so we listen when we're selling diamonds we're gonna provide this information for you we're not gonna dictate to you what you do and don't prefer some people say you know something is even with these past three diamonds that we just looked at or even the ones that leak the light you know if for some reason you prefer that appearance that departs say from our signature line we can help you quit the head - okay that's fine and Danny you know that there's more of those on the market then there is the kind of diamonds that constitute our signature line but these are three great examples of diamonds would read the great red reflector images great ideal great ideal scope images and fire scope images and diam x-ray images but don't quite make the top grades alright so thank you so much for watching this video I'm sorry if I kept you a little longer than anticipated and stay tuned on our next tutorial on the a set because I think we're going to be using these same exact diamonds in the a set that alone helped explain more particularly with these last three diamonds that we just looked at thank you for watching and stick with us [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "0kw6iWoH11E": "let's discuss appraisals if a person selling you a diamond says something like you're paying five thousand dollars for this ring but i'm going to appraise it for twelve thousand dollars wow sounds like the deal of a lifetime until you find out what it takes to be a qualified diamond jewelry appraiser nothing it's true you don't need to take a single course in gemology of any kind there are no state or federal regulations zero qualifications required look if I wanted to cut hair in the state of New Hampshire today I would need to attend a certified hairdressing school take months of classes and hundreds of hours of training and only then with the state issue me a license to cut here however if you wanted to open your own jewelry appraisal service anywhere in the United States and charged seventy-five dollars an hour and write tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry appraisals there's nothing stopping you so watch out for the jewelry store owner who suggests the five thousand dollar diamond he just sold you is actually worth twelve thousand dollars by writing you an inflated appraisal now this is how an appraisal should work first a jewelry appraisal is required when ensuring a diamond ring and it should be done by an appraiser who has a degree in gemology the only school offering this degree is the GI a and the highest degree is graduate gemologist so the first question you should ask when discussing an appraisal is what are the qualifications of the person providing the appraisal second the appraisal price should be somewhat higher than what you paid for the diamond because if a loss occurs it'll happen sometime in the future for example if the ring is stolen three years from now it'll most likely cost more to replace it so having an appraisal value higher than today's price is very helpful let me explain why you should always and I repeat always ensure your jewelry on a separate rider to your homeowners or apartment insurance it's basically a policy within a policy to cover individual expensive items you may pay a slightly higher premium but it's worth every penny basic homeowner policies only cover jewelry stolen from the home and for a very limited amount of money a jewelry rider ensures your jewelry no matter where you are in the world and under almost any circumstances for example if the ring is stolen from your hotel room or if you lose the ring swimming in the ocean or maybe you left it in the bathroom when you were washing your hands with a jewelry rider you are covered one hundred percent with no deductible what happens if the diamond falls out they replace it no deductible what happens if the stone chips they replace it with no deductible it's truly amazing coverage one important thing to remember the insurance company will only pay up to the amount listed on the appraisal so if you haven't updated your jewelry appraisals in the last five years you may not receive enough money to replace your ring most insurance companies recommend updating jewelry appraisals every five years here's another tip that will save you hundreds of dollars don't fall for the crazy store programs like lifetime guarantees or extended warranties and these payment protection plans that cost you a ton of money most only cover normal wear and tear which means they get to decide if they want to fix it or not plus you have to bring your ring in every six months to be inspected or you lose the coverage and what happens if it's lost or stolen nothing they don't cover loss my advice don't let these high-pressure sales people talked you into these expensive programs save your money and just by real jewelry insurance from the same company protecting your home", "Z35Wku6cpY8": "sup guys so I got a buddy's live resident this is a sativa pineapple kimochi Correction hybrid my bad it got some of the information on the back some of the terpene profiles used to get the strain to taste the way it does there's zero CBD which sucks but I mean kind of excited cuz still some this is still live resin so just try to shut out it's a bit darker than the last two you I had from buddies so just try it out and the the shed in the backyard another taste you could definitely take some pineapple kind of tastes like the pineapple version of cz also got the battery which is just a easy draw you don't have to press any anybody or anything so pretty pretty dope now the clear tips nice - yeah so overall overall a great package say it again so let's think rapes when is a Cecil cartridge puts in work so hope you guys are smoking tool especially on while this quarantine is in place and this rain makes it even better so yeah once again every pull you you have on this it's pretty smooth I haven't really tried see sell that much I had a palm palm battery that kind of broke like two months into it so that was a fail and so far I have no complaints on see so it burns very evenly it's a small to draw so we got day four of the pineapple kimochi hybrid it still hasn't lost his taste the pool is still pretty small it's not getting stuck yet on the mouthpiece so this buddy's pen battery / cartridge has been pretty great for a hybrid now when I saw the TV 65% I was kind of like I'm not gonna feel it or for whatever reason but I was wrong it's very very strong and the battery lasts forever so tonight obtained recommend Cheers", "BRGfaxGTDlM": "[Music]", "z5VDxhDIiys": "[Music] foreign [Music]

hotel suite as you can see right behind me you did see the view right there but like i said i did promise that i was going to do a buddies video on here i did try this buddies before guys but i never did like a specific video on it this is blue skittles unopened i definitely purchased uh at authentic before i came to san diego because i checked the san diego prices here it's just crazy so uh i know how you guys feel you know the people that live in these crazy-ass cities where you know it's hard to find uh affordable cannabis products but we got the blue skittles as you can see about 8.26 turn profile hopefully you guys are seeing this good so we're going to open this we do have my chill battery and we're just gonna have a session on the on the balcony of a hotel suite you know i'm saying so hopefully you guys are having a good day you know what i'm saying i appreciate you guys for coming through i mean you get to hear all these other people talking hopefully you can hear me i know there's a lot of uh background noise so hopefully you're counting and [ __ ] but we're gonna take a hit of this session now then not like being on a balcony and smoking fat i'll tell you right now the beautiful views of san diego uh the vlog is coming along pretty nice uh it's actually still in progress but because you know i'm still here i just got here it's only like 11 a.m so but yes uh just uh a cartridge session with the blue skittles buddy cart uh i will be hitting this a few more times but after that i'm going to show you around the balcony just to show you guys a better give you guys a better look at what i'm actually looking at here because it's [ __ ] amazing the skies are clear uh and also i'd like to thank you guys for just showing the constant support as of right now i uh i've achieved 10 000 subscribers as i'm in san diego and i'd like to thank you guys for for the just unwavering support and uh just always being there you know watching my videos spending time out of your day and uh you know showing some random dude on youtube for some love you know so i appreciate that i'm gonna take a few more hits for you and then like i said show you around the whole thing [Music] you see my cousin right there but you will see him in the in the san diego vlog like this one is its own video i try to make the best of the trips in terms of how many videos i can actually get out of the trip like with uh last week's camping i had four videos so i'm gonna try and do at least two uh so this one and then the san diego vlog maybe something else will come up that'll pick my interest that might deserve its own video you know i'm saying you should actually see the makeshift tripod i'm using i'm using my backpack but uh cheers boys i'm taking another hit so as you can see i just put it on here but we got my cousin yeah man but look at this look at the views where oh you want to peep at me i'll zoom up on you [ __ ] you san diego for you guys what's going on over there it's so popular you see everything out here all right guys that's going to be it for the video i will be continuing on uh continuing on with the san diego vlog so you don't you'll still have content

you get a hint of strawberry it did come with this little card inside that reads due to supply interruptions caused by kovat 19 we will be using C cell cards to fill supply gaps we will be back to our all ceramic cards as soon as possible so I guess they use all ceramic carts most the time but right now due to Co vid they're using the C cell which most companies do use the C cell but there's nothing wrong with it alright I hope you guys are stand baked out there having a great morning great afternoon night whatever time it is you're watching this let's get it in liquid diamond okay right up to get it was extremely smooth as in when I was hitting it I couldn't even tell I was hitting anything until I bleep I didn't even know I was getting anything till I blew the smoke out that's how smooth it was highness it's you do feel it diamond sauce card these are pretty pricey I can't lie to you guys for the gram it ran me almost 60 bucks about 60 bucks for this gram so if you can't afford it don't worry about it that's why I'm reviewing it for you guys then you know if it's worth this [ __ ] or not see if you turn it upside down to see how thick it is oh yeah that shit's bomb do the bubble test take forever for that bubble to start going up really smooth it doesn't it's not a fruity flavor though for a be calling golden strawberry it's not like all fruity or strawberry tasting I actually like it cuz I don't like the fruity carts the reason I got this one is because it was the highest THC when they had it so I'm spending 60 bucks for the gram they get the one with the most THC they got ain't [ __ ] around that little baby [ __ ] [Music] it's a lot like a raw gardens cart to me I don't know what the difference is you know between live dot or liquid diamond sauce cart it says distillate free additive free contains a hundred percent cannabis oil so yeah I like the packaging I like that little I like the packaging a lot I think that's pretty neat you like it I gotta say I thought I was gonna get me a lot more baked off the first couple hits than it has so far but like smoothness and flavor is good behind us is good too but for the 60 bucks I was hoping it was gonna kick me in the dick a little harder than what I'm feeling right now I don't know it could be one of those creepers maybe it takes a minute and then it then it hits me does the longer I'm sitting of course I'm getting more stone but I'm taking more hits I'm gonna do a whoo - ooh for you guys not too crazy I'm gonna go to Capitola beach tomorrow if any of you guys know where that's at I'm gonna

one more hit and give you guys a review [Music] [Music] all right I've took enough hits already to where I can get you a give you my honest review on it I wanted to Big Ups it because I spend a lot of money on it and you know it's fancy it's this stole diamond sauce cart so I thought it was gonna [ __ ] be like the best car I ever had but to be honest with you guys I like the raw garden ones and the la cloche ones better than this one so far maybe the diamond or the liquid diamond sauce is isn't that great for me I don't like it maybe maybe I like the the live resin or distillate it seems like gets me more babies as a smoothness and flavor it's awesome a fear like a beginner or you know I don't wanna be raped like sexist but like a girl that only likes to smoke a little bit this is probably for you and here's somebody that's a hardcore smoker and smokes a lot like I do it's probably not the ally you want to go down because you still feel yourself wanting to take a DAB or a bong hit or something it just doesn't fully do it for you so my official review for the Ursa liquid diamond sauce cards golden strawberry I'm honestly gonna have to give it a even 6 you know especially for the price I paid it does get you high don't get me wrong I got me you got me loaded but I'm just I expected a little more so and even 6 do what you want with that all right in this [ __ ] with a hoot and shoot everybody gotta stand up get you guys a function shot my badass rig alright hope you guys got your bunks packed blunts [ __ ] lit dad rigs ready all that [ __ ] smoke along with me tell me in the comment section what the [ __ ] you guys want me to review next or what you guys are smoking on I'm curious and thank you to all my supporters [Music] thank you guys for watching hope you enjoyed until next time smoking will small town [Music]", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "bREeyvJJWq4": "[Music] all right so this is going to be just a quick little video showing off two different styles of baguette diamonds so diamond on the left that's a step cut traditional baguette diamond you can see it has lines in it going from east to west horizontally and the diamond on the right that's actually a brilliant cut baguette it has a lot more little facets cut into it similar to maybe like a princess diamond compared to the diamond on the left that's more like an emerald cut down and with the step cuts you could see that different shapes the one on the right is bigger they come in all shapes and sizes I'm just showing you the difference in the facet structure between the chair and here's what both baguettes look like alongside a round hearts a narrow diamond if they could be put alongside any shape diamond all right so and here's another type of baguette little gold offers this one's called the French cut again and if I could get a position right you're gonna see right here there is a diamond shaped facet cut into the table of the diamond and other than that it's very similar to the traditional cut forget with the step cuts just with the diamonds facet on the table and I think it adds a little bit more flair to this on to the diamond but I just figured I'd show you the three types that we offer and keep in mind - the other two they were in a tray so they looked a little bit dusty this one's nice and loose they look really bright and clean like this once they're placed in the setting so yeah thanks for watching the video", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you",

"l5Ft--ZR3FI": "[Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it's another steel axe video and it's a different strain obviously but you know I ever was really really impressed with the first dizzy wax so why not do another one you know I'm saying this one's a different strain if you couldn't tell from the title you know I'm saying it's mimosa it's a sativa and it's just as fire so we're gonna bring this out for you and I like to mention that I did try it already because here's the story I got it yesterday and mommy bought it for me if you guys didn't see from that video and I gave him 30 bucks he bought it for me because he was going to the club already so I told him you know can you pick me up one and he gave me one and I didn't want to go to Blake's house empty-handed so we used some of this wax we we do eat just been smoking so I just thought I'd let you guys know you know there's I'm not trying to lie in here and stuff so you know there's a reason why there's like a little clip right here and if you do see it's a little skimped a little bit you know it's not really in full gram it's because of that so as you can see dizzy knows I ain't got the good stuff you know positive going too fast okay and like I said it's mimosa and we can go on the THC percentage as well it's 79 percent THC so we're gonna go right here I didn't have this on the last one so it's good that we have this little but let's just there you go you go pause if I'm going too fast okay guys now I'm saying I'm sorry for the lighting I did let me see if I can get some laying here there we go there we go alright so got the trusty utility in five you already enough video so let me open this guy's and show you what it actually looks like no the thumbnail looks pretty good right that's why you click on the video so right off the bat very very nice package and very simple you know sticker that protects it off I'm saying this is uh this is area its dizzy mimosa and I'm gonna show you guys through the camera so let me just show you what I'm looking at and the smells are not as like as strong as the other one the banana pie but oh my god just really good as well still not too stinky but wow look at that and all its sauces up there so me packing it here [Music] I've noticed I tend to notice because uh I don't know if you noticed in that one video Monty bought like five my grams are this stuff most of them are like whitish whitish oil or wax very very strong smelling though get rid of that real quick okay so this is packed we're try this so cheers boys [Music] very very flower tasting it's like I don't know it's a very very close to the flower taste you can get very very clean taste you know it's like if you remove all the stuff that you get from actually burning the plant and you just get the all the essentials essential oils and all that stuff and you're just trying that this is what that tastes like you know I'm saying I've never truly tried mimosa the strain but I've heard there is like a hint of orange because you know mimosas isn't they like orange juice and like champagne I do not get a hint of orange on this it's more of a very very cooked kind of taste if that makes any sense has a very similar taste of cookies I will take another hit though because this [ __ ] is fire and I just woke up from a nap and I need some of this kickstart with the rest of this day so just did another one of these hopefully I don't drop my dad to lien [ __ ] [ __ ] but let me know if you've tried to dizzy wax I mean I've met I've recommended it my home he plate says that you know I did he says that it sucks that I had to make a video on it because once I make a video on it I basically put it on blast and you know everyone one kind of goes for it and that's what I wanted to do you know I'm sorry for Blake you know like he I mean first come first serve you know I'm saying so at the end of the day I want you guys to experience what I have so if you guys are in the Modesto area and you guys look for my channel to like get the best like products or getting best like look at the products before you get it you know I try to do that you know so that's cool you know like that Blake was like yeah she had made a video because now everyone got it and she I'm like damn that's crazy the the power of the internet you know I'm saying so cheers boys [Music] I wouldn't recommend this if you try to be discreet cuz this is smell it's just my leg astray like you they know you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] you know so I'm gonna pack one more hit for the video then we're gonna end it here let me know like I said if you try it's Disney wax I know it's pretty new I looked online and it's like I'm like the only one with a video on like their wax so it's pretty crazy I would have thought that I would have been a little bit later you know all these influencers or cannabis content creators in LA I would have thought they probably would have got one from like dizzy themself but now and did a video but I'm saying cheers boys [Music] [Music] very KFC tastes to a very nice gassy taste you know when you get like you try like that good but like that kind of gas but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this dizzy wax I know it's another one that I've done but like I said I was very much in love with the first one so I figured you know let's dedicate another video to another stream so other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music]", "F9GJKOYgzXU": "I'm standing in a secluded place in the diamond district that's very exclusive I'm gonna be teaching you guys about manufacturing diamonds jewelry prices wholesale retail okay first and foremost you want to take a look at this collection of jewelry and I'm going to reference the prices using this bottle of water right here okay this bottle of water cost $1 at the local store okay if you buy a 24 pack it comes out to about 18 cents that means the price goes up 400% just for buying one bottle I'm with a bottle of water a dollar you could let it go people that the price comes from refrigeration costs the clerks fees the rent for the store so on and so forth but when you're buying a piece of jewelry you might want to pay referencing this price 25 cents 28 cents not a dollar versus that cost price of 18 cents and there's a way to do that and that's to be able to get the right connections to the right places so you could pay a fair price a fair a fair wage so let's talk about the jewelry this is produced by a special factory we call it in the jewelry industry blue magic all right it has this beautiful blue tag all right when we look at tags that's how we tell what's going on with the jewelry who's manufacturing and how they're manufacturing it you can take a look at this beautiful ring alright beautiful baguettes beautiful setting it's very very balanced in its production I'm going to show you some more pieces okay let's take a look at this particular ring it's a beautiful work of art all right it's all manufactured for different specifications you see I let the pieces floating on top of that band that's difficult to assemble difficult to set beautiful polish and beautiful finishing finishing is how you polish it how you polish the prongs if you pre polish before you set the stones all these things are hard to reference when you're looking at for the first time and people cut corners this Factory does not so I really encourage the purchase of this particular Factory it's the Blue Magic tag it's not only available track so I see it's available a lot of other places but you know I'm looking out for your interest I'm telling you jewelry that I personally recommend that I personally like some of the new designs this cross tray right here take a look and let's talk about some prices this particular item right here is a beautiful 1.6 across how do we reference the price the price is about 2500 all rights of high quality goods beautiful finishing look at the posh on the back no scratches nothing like that how do you get these prices that these prices you know you might know the price of a bottle of water that's what I'm saying but you don't know the price of jewelry trying to give you a reference point alright if this this jewelry here was a bottle of water I'd be charging about 28 cents 29 cents a fair reasonable price with a lowest possible markup alright because we're able to distribute online on tracks when c-calm alright or be able to distribute across the country and spread the price out evenly over a variety of customers imagine you're buying a 24 pack so you only won one bottle so you buy it with 24 other people and then you get the wholesale price okay so let's reference some more prices some more items right here okay take a look at these trays it's beautiful collection this is what you really really want I'm sure everybody's gonna want to know the price of different items one of my favorites right here it's a beautiful ring rose gold white gold the right Rodie of the right finishing the right prices the right everything else 5.3 carats Blue Magic this ring in a store they have to charge ten thousand bucks nine thousand dollars okay this particular ring would be able to do for around 4,300 alright that's closer to the wholesale and it doesn't have to be all expensive look at this beautiful tray of little Jesus heads really nice one of my favorites right here yellow gold let me throw a price on you guys for a reference we're talking about 1.88 carats blue magic piece for about $2,400 alright beautiful finishing on the back the finishing is really what I like about it take a look at this look at the back of this ring on average you're not gonna see such a mirror finish on the back of her ring this is really manufactured there's a specific specifications with the right setting let's throw a price at you guys for this well this one's around 4,800 you call the number or your email customer track so my see if you want to better pray some of these people on these pieces we're gonna be able to help you out even with that as well okay once again incredible items take a look at this tray this just got in from factory no one touched it no one's been grubbing on it it's not in the jewelry store I'm not in the jewelry store right now I'm in the diamond district doing business with my fans and the people that are watching me on the other side of this camera lens alone okay that's how I'm doing it that's how I'm doing it personally and I want to be able to this is a competitive business I'm competing I'm offering prices I'm offering the right service hit the number that you're seeing this or alongside with this if you like any of these particular pieces series inquiries only all right if you want to know this and that you know check the website these pieces are on the website as well strike some icy calm easiest way to buy me personally lay it away take your time pay for it and you could only what you want to own again beautiful pieces gold heavy look at the design there's always a beautiful touch on the inside of these pieces and that's what you want on you want to own something because the design there's a material cost diamond cost gold cost labor cost and then there's a design which is design is relatively free a designer to design it but that is really adds a lot of value because when you're trying to sell this ring it's these little touches on the back that are gonna make something somebody want to buy it and then when you buy it you've got a desirable piece of jewelry a blue magic piece that you could then resell just if when you get bored and ready to upgrade not a piece of junk that's fallen to pieces in three years that's blue magic that's the quality we got to track some I see", "0CIgYyCFgco": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in

what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes

oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth trying doesn't taste good and giving you guys a score to kind of stay consistent with so appreciate you guys for the love we'll see you all in the next review love y'all peace", "fwwExPZ4JuQ": "hello everyone and welcome back Dan's boo to bodega today I'm gonna be going over another fine product from Cresco it's not just gonna blow your mind it's gonna blow your head off today we're gonna be going over diamonds [Music] all right before I go ahead and review this product I'd like to touch a little bit on the strain today's strain is gonna be lying sorbets from crest goes reserve stock and it's completely delicious it is a cool little mix of katsu bubba kush and lime skunk two very distinct strains from Cresco okay so now that we've gotten that out of the way what you say we go ahead and review the product now Cresco lime sorbet Diamonds is unlike any THC isolate we've been able to get here in Chicagoland and the reason why is because usually when you get it it's a THC a powder okay not this this like they call it diamonds it looks just like that maybe a little bit smaller about the size of rock salt but I'm jesting it tastes a whole lot better I'm very excited to try this so what do you say we go ahead and get a dab in it okay so when you buy this product you also get a little syringe that's got about half a gram of HTE sauce in it this is how I like to do it anyway I get the ice lid on there and then just slather it up in that beautiful terpene sauce okay yeah and I'm you know dab in here around like so I think 550 yeah 550 and you know what the taste on this guy's is out of this world I've heard a lot of people call it like lime and lemon lime and this and that but to me it's tastes just like Kiwi watermelon hopefully by now you guys know that I will not sacrifice the integrity of this channel by endorsing a product I do not stand behind 100% so when I say that this product is the best tasting I have had ever it's not to be taken lightly I mean it's if there's it's not a hidden taste either it's like a big refreshing just like you just popped in a starburst or a Jolly Rancher I really haven't tasted anything like this and until you taste it it's you're gonna understand till you taste it just how hard it is to describe the level of awesomeness to this product just like with the flavor this products effects are out of this world because while it is a heavy indica there is no sedation that is usually associated with a heavy THC product that is an indica which in my eyes makes it a perfect strain or relaxation or if you suffer from anxiety this is a great anti-aging depression you know it yeah depression because again uplifting not so much euphoric but you know refreshing and just you know I get that relaxation that you need that you've been looking for all day and now while this is an excellent tasting excellent feeling a very effective product it is pricey okay it's probably the most expensive grams you'll buy considering that I believe they start around like a hundred and twenty you know a gram so in that's like a half a gram of the isolate and half a gram of the terpene sauce another plus with the terpene sauce though is that it tastes when you go to a lick it it tastes amazing just as good as it you know when you're dabbing it same flavor too so yeah if you gotta try it you're gonna be amazed just even get a look a little quick you know lick and you'll taste it it's awesome but you know if you got a little bit extra and you wanted to try something or if you only need just maybe once one or two dabs a week oh man yeah for sure go ahead and grab this because you don't need a lot at all well guys that just about does it for me I'd like to say thank you to all the viewers all the subscribers all of everybody that's been corta and supporting me if you had if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up means a lot if you have any questions comments or dirty limericks go

cushion diamond and the neat thing about this diamond and why we're making the video of it is because it's actually a lab-grown cushion which you don't see often with this passage structure it's actually the first time we've seen one and let's take a look at some other features so what I like about these diamonds are the intense brilliance they emit a lot of times you put a cushion diamond next to a high-end GI a triple excellent round diamond and it just totally gets outperformed regarding brilliance but here you could see it definitely holds its own [Music] that's because they have a similar facet structure just a different shape overall if you look at the Diamonds asset image you'll understand why it's so bright we have a lot of light return it's pretty much basically what you want to see in both round and these type of Christian diamonds so now we're hearing the diamond using natural daylight and you can see how bright it is another cool feature about this diamond is the price if this was an earth grown diamond we'd be looking at around probably $25,000 or so a diamond with these stats being that this diamonds lab-grown I think it's around ten thousand four hundred so that's less than half the cost significantly less than half visually to the human eye there's no difference the substance is no difference it's 100% diamond and it's just something we'd want to show

usage for this I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't know leave my personal information are you what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so I actually have a concentrate review for you guys in this video and I actually just recorded this video and I'm going to go edit it realize the microphone wasn't working correctly for whatever reason hands aren't on I was super annoying it's not the rerecord this video so if n any parts in this video it seems like I'm kind of like rushing through ports because I kinda already know my like my final review you know what I mean so I apologize about that it's just really annoying having to record a video I just recorded you know what I mean so this is some pretty far [ __ ] wax in that video that I just said I'd recorded and there was no audio on it I took some pretty fat dabs in there so I might throw those clips in that in this video somewhere but there's gonna be no audio in it so I'll probably just put music or something over it so you'll see those fat I mean they weren't fat fat but there was some pretty decent sized abs you know what I mean so I've been wanted to do these like concentrate reviews like watch reviewer videos like challenges or dad's you know it means fat dad challenges or I don't know videos like that you know the mean stuff want to see some more videos like that just tell me down below in the comments I don't know why this is on my finger oh I'll show you that in a second but this is um item 9 lab so if you guys see my review on the Apollo 710 this is by the same company this is just actual on the Apollo 710 is like their pod system anatomy like the pods this is like their actual concentrate so much are you guys are actual concentrates now I believe this is just like an Arizona that local Arizona brand baked like it a brand based in Arizona but um I'm not sure if they branched out to other states through not yet but if they have let me know down below in the comments and if you tried them before let me know down below in the comments what you think of them I think they're [ __ ] far definitely one of my favorite brands out here in Arizona especially with the deals they have constantly [ __ ] fire well I picked up is some rubber glue number four and it's actually some THC a so THC a and if you guys know anything about THC a um when you get up to like the high potencies like tested at 90 99.1 percent THC I'll say the [ __ ] looks like [ __ ] almost straight crystal meth like it's crazy I can find the picture I'll poke a picture of it right here but this is only tested by 85 so it has like a slider golden tint to it but it's still like crystals you know what I mean so it's [ __ ] fires so yeah again it's called Gorilla Glue number four that's the strain and then it's a THC a diamonds so here's the front of it I had a nice lab well this is a little sticker this isn't this was it on the front of it I forget what the [ __ ] what was it but now I put it on the front so you see it's tested to 85% okay with number four and this is something that I really like that they just started doing recently so it tells you the terpenes that use so if you know anything about that and your interest there you go and it also gives you like a brief description of how you're gonna feel so this is us listen Teva obviously so you're gonna feel relaxed happy in your with your fork I'm the bad just has the Arizona Department of Health warning all that good you know what I mean I don't know I think he's focused don't know yeah there you go and I hopefully you guys can see that but not it says I'm one gram THC a diamonds real agreed number four so yeah item nine loves and then I don't know the packaging pretty simple self-explanatory you know what I'm saying so that's the packaging so you open it up and again like I said I already opened it up so it's already been to open but I kind of repackage that the best of my abilities so I'm the packaging is pretty sick you open it up and only me and then you're greeted with this you take this out the top is gonna depend like the color is gonna depend if you about a sativa indica or a hybrid and that guys are gonna be like a purple top hybrids are gonna be a green top of them correct and then sativa is obviously looking orange so take this out of the package in I'll give you guys a quick look at the wax real quick and also got some close-up shots I'll show you guys but here's the wires real quick I can even see it's like diamonds you know I mean straight diamonds alright so yeah there's those close-up shots [Music] so hopefully you guys enjoyed those let's just hop into this now I'm gonna do I'm gonna give this like a um there's five ways I'm going to rate this I'm gonna go over the packaging which I already did the looks and the quality of the concentrates with five you showed you guys the taste the high and then the price point so the second to five factors I'm going to rate and then from those five factors I'm gonna give it like overall rate in the Ottoman so I already won over the packaging a little bit and this that except it so I'll get that a four out of five is it was pretty it's packed it's pretty [ __ ] dope I mean like it's pretty sick but there's definitely like companies up there's definitely companies out there that like having a lot better or like cooler more funner I guess how does it like you know what I mean like more unique packaging you know I mean so it's not like the fancy is the coolest packaging I've seen but it's still really [ __ ] to open like professional I guess I mean it gets the job done there I mean the looks in the corporate the quality of their wife's four point five out of five this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired like I said like I say in almost all my reviewing videos even though this is my review video I'm always interested I think I want to know what you guys think of it so leave a comment down below what you guys think of it um even though you guys like don't get this smokey I mean maybe you have tried it in the past so if you have coming what you thought of it but if you guys have any you guys are just watching the video just off the lokes or with whatever just tell me what you guys think of it what I mean but what will happen now so I'll give you guys a taste test like I said I wanted with a high test and then the price prior so what I'm gonna be that bad at this little just generic fun the recycler rigged nothing too crazy you know I mean just basic but it gets the job done you got a man like shirt rips low key so since we're doing that taste test first I'm gonna get like that like the size that I was not gonna be crazy um and if you guys never had THCA it's like really hard like kind of get on a Davidge so what I'm doing is plus my carb cat bro I'm a [ __ ] 80 and I dropped it somehow so I just been using this as a carb cap like an empty little wax container but I just put a little bit of the thta in here and then I'm just gonna like dump it in there and then use this as the carb cap you know anything this is a little dab I got right here it's not the biggest of but like I said this is the taste edge so kind of smoking along to you guys smoking something dang and [Music] let's just [ __ ] off into this alright so like I said if you guys are smoking alone Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] yes I said this in the previous video like the one um that had a lot the audio messed up in you and I mean doesn't really have like much flavor to it but again th th da is like it's like super [ __ ] peer it's like in the 90% you know I mean so theoretically well you shouldn't have too much flavor and crap you know what I mean but it's definitely taste like [ __ ] like like I mean it has a flavor to it like doesn't really taste like they like the growler glue strings that kind of love referring to on it so um definitely taste like wax your this lit though so long like that's pretty much like you just get a strong like wax this Latisse you don't really take I mean like you get like a hint at the Gorilla Glue but baby you can just tell us there but definitely fire and it definitely rips as you see so but I think I gave the the taste like at three and a half or I don't know this because this is where it's really hard that's kind of the panel where you want to go with it because it doesn't taste the best like I said it doesn't have a lot of flavor that's because it's really good [ __ ] the wax and peer so I mean I could give it like a [ __ ] 5 or like a four point something out of five because it's like so like it's pure and it doesn't really taste like much like it's just pure you know what I mean or I could give it like a little bit of a lower rating because it doesn't taste like that 35 degrees you know I mean a lot of people like with wax so it's really like a personal preference I guess but I guess I'll just go in the middle I'll give you like a four out of five in the taste but no it's definitely [ __ ] fire so well don't get me wrong on that that's just kinda a personal preference you know I mean it's s kinda hard to give a rating the high so yeah I'm gonna take a fat dad real quick and then I'll show you guys a couple of those um dads that attack in the last video there's gonna be no audio so I'm just gonna put music over them or something and then um just cuz I don't want those clips go to waste song and do something with those so then after I show you those clips I'll give you guys my heart I'll give you guys the high rating and then I'll go over the price point and then I guess we'll just wrap this video up so let me get a little jab going here oh and real quick I picked up these to fire your cards right here by Delta eight I believe that's the brand name I never tried this brand before but they had a sale going on them so you know me with the sales I had to pick them up and I just look at this package in this [ __ ] package it looks fired I got pineapple Express and Clementine I said alright Clementine but you you know I mean and just look at that oil that [ __ ] looks fire so be on the lookout for these reviews but I've got put a little bit more in here that I meant to but [ __ ] it we'll take this little big chunk so this is gonna be a fat dab right here so I'm gonna take the staff show you guys those other clips like I just said and then I'm look do the final ratings [Music] that's a little bit hot again like his dad would be fat so if you guys are smoking along cheers I hope you guys always poking along hope you guys are smoking something dank and [Music] let's get this [ __ ] probably about to kill myself with this just kidding this is [ __ ] lightweight to me when I saw those dad challenges how long I have a video of me taking a [ __ ] seven grab dab on my Instagram if you guys want to see that go check it out but it's like a old video it does research for there yeah let's get this [Music] like super clean super smooth definitely gives you that lung expansion like if you don't that too often you're definitely gonna call like that like it they go you so I got iron lungs yeah I mean but fullness is Deb yes I want to sit his dad challenges I was talking about like Brown challenge videos like me taking a granddad or some [ __ ] like that down below in the comments so I'll do some [ __ ] like that too but that was a fat dab um I got these bright lights and they make it hard for the camera pick up the spokes in time so sometimes all the smoke shows up in the camera which kind of sucks both lucky um um let me show you those clips I was talking about so I can go that no audio that's fed into those [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then we bummer that audio got messed up the taste I already gave it taste the rating so the hi I'm gonna give the high like a 4.7 out of five because it's a [ __ ] that stupid fire you know I mean like but there's just sex and THC out there that's like 99.1 percent so it was like compared to that it's not as good but for the price point that aside it's only 50 dollars a gram and when I got it it was a fall one get one free so I think we got a $25.00 a ground which is [ __ ] crazy like you can't beat that you'll if you ever see I'll do on the area you pick it up ready so the price point I give it a 4.5 out of 5 just cuz 50 bucks is a little bit pricey or ground liming for this this quality I don't know that's kind of like you maybe even like I'm gonna give it like a 4.8 4.9 out of 5 that's actually that's really not a bad price with teachers like this quality wife's you know what I mean so somewhere between like a 4.8 yeah see ya thought like a 4.8 out of 5 on the price point but the overall score for this way well it's like super close to a five honestly this is like my favorite like laughs I've had bottom so far I don't know this [ __ ] is just stupid [ __ ] fire if you ever tried it if I rich tried item nine lab just let me know down below in the comments what you thought of them if you haven't just be on the lookout for them definitely try them if you ever had the opportunity you won't regret it I promise besides for that there's a final reading like a four point seven four point eight or five shit's [ __ ] fired yeah if you want to see more videos like this I mean down below in the comments besides for that yep give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do it that good [ __ ] you're do you know what to do you're on your peace", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "0pr9WCJaqpQ": "[Music] hi there it's Alex from Christine Jewelers so we get a lot of people asking about what's the difference between a synthetic diamond imitation diamond and a natural diamond what should we look for so today I'm gonna give you a little bit information the difference between a synthetic and imitation diamond so what is the invitation diamond is invitation time is something like a cubic zirconia or I'm on tonight which only looks like a diamond but they have different very different chemical and physical properties for example the the cubic is created from a psycho neon dioxide so it naturally is a heavier stone so the added weight on Deer on the cubic makes it a little bit more difficult for light to pass through so therefore it means it has less brilliance on on the stone it has a lower refractive index than a natural diamond it's a little bit more affordable and well I mean a lot of it's a lot affordable in price but many people do find that it's a little bit too perfect to make it a substitute for a diamond but synthetic diamonds are much harder to detect so there's two main main synthetic diamonds one called the HP HD high high-pressure high-temperature growth which involves the diamond formation from a molten metal such as iron nickel and the the newer method is called the CVD known as the chemical vapor deposition low prep low pressure high temperature growth time information from a gas in a vacuum chamber in order to identify the natural diamond from a synthetic diamond you need specialized equipment did not the nature of inclusions in the natural diamond the first from the types of inclusions found in a synthetic diamond but not all inclusions are easily visible to the naked eye or or by using just the irregular loop so the best way to find out if the diamond is natural or synthetic is to ask your jeweler for a grading import such as the GI a so in terms of like the price depending on the size color and clarity the lab gold diamonds can up can can be up to thirty to thirty percent less expensive than a net versus a natural diamond the price might differ if the lab room time is the or F in color so in conclusion even even though the origins of the synthetic diamond is different from a natural diamond but the structure is still the same when is lab-grown when it's earth mined but in my opinion that earth mined diamonds is almost like a nature form of art and it's it's very unique every every diamond is different so that's that's it for today if you have any questions leave leave a comment down below and I'll see you in the guys in the next video thanks [Music]", "Gh4P5JmnNaY": "what is diamond fluorescence is it good is it bad is it something you need to worry about these are all things we're going to talk about today in this video [Music] so most people have no idea what diamond fluorescence actually means but they're told that they should stay away from it at all costs and I want to sort of explain what it is so that you understand what it means how it affects a stone and if it's something that you want to consider in your purchase so diamond fluorescence is the tendency for a stone to glow when it's subjected to ultraviolet light for example the blacklight the effects of fluorescence are not something you would normally see under your everyday circumstances and most people don't see it even comparing two stones one that has it and one that doesn't so for me there's some value in purchasing a stone that might have fluorescence that doesn't actually affect the beauty of the stone fluorescence is present in about 30% of diamonds out there and it will be graded with either none faint medium or strong fluorescence this effect it's actually pretty cool the science guys out there may appreciate this you'll see here that this stone shows no effect if we move here now this stone has faint fluorescence and you can see some of the blue moving here this one has medium and now that blue intensifies it's actually a cool feature and not something you're seeing naked eye without something like this in general when you have a fluorescence in a stone that's absolutely not something you're going to see with your own naked even when you use a backlight it's really difficult to see those effects some of those effects can include a milkiness or a haziness in the stone but that's generally something you wouldn't see until you're at the medium or strong level and even at those levels you still may not see that effect fluorescence will actually discount the pricing of a stone so it can play to your benefit in terms of value if you're comparing two stones that are equal across the board otherwise that fluorescence may actually just give you a better pricing situation and for me if you can't see it it's definitely something you should consider her value one way that fluorescence is actually good is that when you have a stone that's let's say je or below her color so it has some yellow in it the blue fluorescence which is sort of opposite on the color scale can counter out some of that yellow so can actually enhance the color of the stone and make it look whiter so if it's something that you're open to and it's not negatively affecting the stone it's definitely something you should consider it actually may bump up the price when we're looking at a low colored stone with the strong fluorescence because of that enhanced color future sometimes it's actually cool to highlight the feature of fluorescence in a piece of jewelry so there are some instances where fluorescence is sought out to be an added feature to a piece to make it really unique and one-of-a-kind so now we've talked about the pros and cons and you need to know about fluorescence I think overall it's not something you should be worried about but now you have more education so going into your purchase you know how it may affect a value of course", "A7CwbxSK3os": "[Music] all right in this video we're comparing an earth drone Dimond alongside a lab-grown diamond and both diamonds the one on the left the earth ground diamond that's gie a triple excellent so it gets the highest grade possible the diamond on the right it's actually graded by IGI and it's graded excellent as well their highest grade and the diamond on the right it's outperforming the diamond on the left and it's not because it's lab-grown and it just has to do with the cut quality and in this view you could see there's a clear difference in brilliance you're getting a lot more light return from their diamond on the right and it actually meets the HS ideal like performance standards just because it's graded GI a triple excellent the diamond on left that one actually doesn't meet the HS ideal light performance standard and it's pretty noticeable and they were using intense light and I wanted to mention it's not easy to find a lab-grown diamond with a Jess idea like performance they're definitely out there but the pickings are slim most of them perform similar to the average jhl excellent even the lab report it could say with a vendor they could say it's ideal that depends on who you're asking and under few standards all right now we're looking at both diamonds using natural daylight and the diamond on the left the earth ground diamond once again you can see it's just not cut as well there's a little bit of a ring of darkness going on under the table so once again I'm not trying to talk down earth groom diamonds at all well promote lab-grown diamonds just in this case although they had the same grade on paper the lab-grown diamond was the better cut one and that's the difference the visual difference you're seeing in this specific case alright thanks for watching the video", "BgqdbcAF-Wc": "in this video we're going to be comparing two diamonds one is a GI a triple excellent excellent cut polished and symmetry it's the highest grade they give the other one is also a GI a triple excellent excellent as you can see in cut polish and symmetry now we actually own this time and this one I kind of hid some of the markings on it it's one of our suppliers diamonds I'm not trying to down talk the inventory so we keep that hidden so good old gold as you might know is big on a set images and this is the first GI a triple excellent diamond we looked at and if you take a look you're gonna see in the a set image as a lot of light leakage all those whites the greens you don't want those really too much in a round diamonds the diamond that we own same score on paper but look at the a set image it's kind of exactly how you want to see it right here you can see both distances and now we're gonna see how these translate into real life so there's really not much to say the diamonds kind of speak for themselves if you know what I mean obviously the one on the right being brighter especially towards the center of the diamond that's where a lot of people focus their attention this is light leakage you're seeing on the diamond on the left that's why we're not getting all that reflection compared to light return on the diamond on the right as supported by the ASA image and once again the difference in brilliance pretty obvious that's why you might go on a website and see one GIH Apple excellent diamond for a few hundred less than another one of the singing exact stats another reason could be the inclusion by the way say you have an SI one one of the inclusions could be off to the side to cover by a prong or not easy to see while the other one could be right in the center can stick out like a sore thumb so there's a few different reasons why diamonds are price different some vendors just try to try to make a little bit more out of them as well so it's the point to do the research just to make sure you're getting a great overall value all right now we're looking at both diamonds using natural daylight the difference is still pretty apparent and even from an angle as I tilt them on with light leakage on an angle it actually gets more dark in some of those areas it's not the case with the other diamonds now don't get me wrong we do offer the type of diamonds with light leakage to and we should be able to compete with anyone's price and doing show we just don't feature them as much because most of our customers rather get diamonds with unbeatable optical performance some hand-picked top-of-the-line gie a triple excellent diamonds for the same price as what others are selling the average ones for you like to give our customers a great value a lot of bang for their buck thanks for watching the video [Applause]", "Rya0msdIE7o": "right in this in this video we're taking a look at two carat a half is I one thing this first diamond on the left is one of our signature hot Sandero diamonds here and Victoria 151 is i1 and this one is a little bit over that in the carat weight another is i1 that we located with a GSI deal optics and yeah and dia X optics and so it's optics full right smack dab in the zenith of the GI AXA GS ideal range absolutely magnificent diamonds okay the only thing that this one got a very good in the symmetry and an excellent in the polish but that's no big deal because it's still a GI a excellent in the cut okay and most importantly ideal optics all right which is what helped bring this diamond a thousand bucks lower than this diamonds alright so beautiful stone now let's look at it in spotlighting okay this is right now we're kind of emphasizing sparkle scintillation so you're going to see we do have a sparkle filter on showing the glint ie the dispersion and the fire that we see coming out of the diamonds very pretty very pretty but both of these diamonds have outstanding optics okay so they're both they're both beautiful all right here's the stronger spotlighting here we are under the stronger spotlighting and this I'm gonna tell you it we had pay dirt with that one but both of these are beautiful absolutely gorgeous diamonds okay and both of these diamonds will back with life fine policies okay so there's a justification for the value differences which we've seen but visually two smoking-hot diamonds", "JeEMHIZPKgc": "how's it going YouTube and welcome to the high

you're on the block you stupid [ __ ] get your dumb ass off the block", "ZA1nDfK9DRM": "[Music] and today we got some great diamonds from cure leaf and a cure leaf grape diamonds live resin cart I was gonna do a little bit of comparing and kind of explain a little bit behind the process of these live resin carts and it's quite a few people or I guess you could say a little bit confused so these carts are gonna be a little different than the live resin cars that you get from like Cali or Colorado it's not gonna have the crystallization or the diamonds you want to stay inside of it because it is distillate guys so this is distillate with the live resin turps reintroduced later on super tasty though and it is really good so it's not gonna be like taking an actual dab how the other tarts would be with the actual diamonds inside of it and stuff it's gonna be like smoking a regular car SuperDuper flavorful with more Terps in it and you should have some more medicinal values of it too whenever they reintroduce those terms so anyways let's jump into this grape diamond to flower real quick I wanted to take a good smell it is Oh oh my gosh guys so guys the smell of these is so similar that's why I know that they are actually using a live resin and bringing the Terps over guys this right here it literally smells the exact same as this taste however that makes sense because the vapor I can't smell it as much as I can like smell an actual flower but the taste is like what I smell right here it's crazy all right guys let's crack one of these buds open and smoke a bowl of this grape diamonds from cure leaf this shit's fire though I don't mind it a lot of people were hating on it but I'm loving it it's got some super good flavor very very tasty definitely grape notes um it had a little bit of peppery and earthy flavors in it it's not bad though really good stuff oh when you break it up it just pretend they're so how's everybody doing with that coronavirus going on y'all smoking on y'all keeping busy during this craziness me and Miss J we were watching some crazy [ __ ] earlier this girl took a steak knife and cut her hair off y'all I think this quarantine is literally driving people crazy [ __ ] I think I'm getting through it um well there's some here on there got some crazy quarantine stories let me know what's up in the comments oh here we go here we go without further ado guys this is great diamonds coming into 22.2% let's get this hemp wig yeah and [Music] [Music] and we're on to Bowl number two guys haha and we are lit bowl number two guys cheers yeah guys yeah definitely peppery super grapey though like a little sweet skunky to it it's really really good though [Music] even even a more like smoked Bowl tastes good super flavorful guys so I got two different batteries guys that we're gonna use for our cart I've got one of the ones from fluid this does three different settings not bad for the price this one right here though I have bolts exchanged and kind of tricked it out a little bit you know yeah I got my Star Wars and my panda bear just adidas alright yeah let's throw this bad boy inside of this one first matter of fact let's throw this bad boy inside of the blue in rumors so I'm gonna take this one green guys it's gonna be a little bit lower temperature that way I can taste it a little better here we go guys cheers this is grape diamonds live resin carp your leave [Music] very tasty it's so crazy how similar the taste is but then again when you think about it if they reintroduce the turbulence to it it's not that crazy it's very very good though guys this cart right here is where it said it's very very tasty [Music] it's literally like taking a small roof of there's great diamonds right here it's kind of tripping me out a little bit it's really good though these are this is the first live resin cart that I've tried so I know we got a lot of controversy going on about these carts guys are they live resident are they not and so many people are going back and forth so it is this sort of guys it's not an actual like I said earlier a DAB in a cart it's gonna be dis lit with the Turks from the live resin reintroduced to it I'll go for a third one guys I'm over here spacing out here we go Cheers super-good I'm gonna try it on the other better see if it tastes any different [Music] I'm over here spinning the big-ass battery instead of spamming cart whoo yeah and we're on guys Cheers a lot more gravy wow that is so much more great B than using that better that's weird maybe the airflow is better that's why I don't know very good though and I don't even smoke cards guys this is actually really good so you are gonna be able to get these in quite a few different strains guys just go check them out it's the live resin carts on their website they don't have them in stock all the time but they got quite a few different strains I saw it in taffy the other day like I said the great diamonds it's gonna vary in price by the percentage of it though so that's the only kind of messed-up thing they should just have a stuck price for them instead of like going up and down just because this one's a little more potent you know I mean it's just it's kind of just nitpicking right now but hopefully those things will change a little bit in the future if you guys haven't check us out on the wheat tube check us out at Lake that's La yke and if you haven't check us out on Instagram check us out at underscore tree show appreciate you watching guys shout outs to all the new and old

dispensary called purple Lotus and I'm gonna buy a bara garden because my raw garden is pretty much empty if it even shows you it's pretty much empty so I'm gonna pick up a raw garden so then we can do a review of these new cars that I got up in Finn and I've been waiting to even try these I haven't even tried it yet it's called Ursa extracts Ursa extracts this is live resin I don't think it has any additives or anything so we're gonna test these out I'm gonna put the link to their Instagram and stuff down below check those guys out there kind of a new wax I've never even heard of them so we're gonna try them out and we're gonna compare them to the raw garden we're gonna see which one's better but we got to pick up some more raw garden because this shit's done sup so about to knock on my friends door and he's gonna pretty much take me so I'm waiting for him he doesn't want to be on camera so using probably not gonna be on camera this whole time sorry guys but how you doing bro all my friends dog dogs except for me as you can see we're gonna get out of here soon guys oh I'm still mad I'm mad about these versa extract the only thing I'm mad about versa extract and I want them to explain to me is how how is this a gram when it's 659 milligrams of THC and 2.3 milligrams of CBD that makes no sense it should be a thousand milligrams all together for 1 grand if I'm trippin tell me I'm trippin in the comments but I'm pretty sure it's a thousand [ __ ] milligrams this is almost like I have [ __ ] gram it's like a big-ass bubble it in [ __ ] but it's probably hella good we don't even know if it's good so I don't even know but no cars guys new cards so we're gonna see what it is I'll get back to you guys when I faith back in you guys already know [Music] [Music] we just pulled up about to walk in here probably won't bring the camera in because I don't think they'll let me record even though cookies let me record inside there I'm still not gonna bring it in just in case you know I don't want to be awkward as [ __ ] but we're gonna go in here bro didn't get as much as I thought I was gonna get but here's Nicki from me this looks like he got the Mendel punch golden gold sauce cartridge strawberry banana cartridge and then yogi berry let's check this [ __ ] out [ __ ] was how much was that [ __ ] BAM 177 53 after taxes for three carts oh four carts I mean sorry four cards one two three four and I only got two cars because I'm broke and because I already bought two other carts to raw garden mendel punch dough see about 120 125 up the tag [ __ ] taxes guys um it's gonna be like an hour and my card 17 minutes just to get back so that these were all garden carts then Nick he got some unique [ __ ] never tried these the Cresco tell me if you guys ever tried them if they're good in the comments you know if you try the cress goes and and you know if you tried the rolls I've never tried to roll I don't even know how to open this box man it looks confusing us [ __ ] probably not even confusing but probably get the taste those later maybe finish lets me get some eventually and then he got the raw garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking for a good rock garden flavor to get it has punch in it or some kind of berry in it usually those ones are pretty good honestly compared to banana bread definitely good banana bread was cool though I ain't gonna diss banana so we out and we're gonna get it we don't get it Ian soon we just gotta find a good place to smoke man all right guys it took [ __ ] forever to get back here but we're back and it's kind of dark so I'm not even gonna go outside and smoke or are we gonna go so I don't know what do you want to do we gotta go outside can be smoking it so we're gonna try this real quick behold alright so we're gonna try out the banana OG first I don't know if I'm gonna try the next one yet but well I mean we're gonna try it another video so that's what it looks like it's focused [ __ ] persona raw garden pin now we got to get the Earth's opinion when is the Ursa pin coming first I tell me in the comments come on [Music] alright guys here goes I'm not gonna lie this [ __ ] is [ __ ] shits ding this shit's powerful it tastes like legit just straight wax was put in there you're taking a straight dab so I guess the live res like it has no distillate no nothing nothing at it cut it to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw garden stuff we got to try that we got it compared to the raw garden no one's better so far though I like the Ursa this shit's pretty dim did you like it what would you take [Music] you heard it you heard them that shit's [ __ ] powerful here you go bro oh yeah we got the Cresco [ __ ] we're gonna pair it to the crest go right now Cresco with a moon robbed that this [ __ ] just tastes like tea to me I swear to god this [ __ ] tastes like tea to me tastes good though it takes hella good yeah yeah but what would you saw here chillin just got done eating or eating and I'm just waiting for some people to hit me up chillin with my boy Nicky no it's just another day in the life of Shaka Zulu wait let me get y'all what y'all really want y'all want to look at the raw garden that's what y'all really here for I mean yeah Rob Carss I don't know I always just loved regarding that's the main when I go for it I know it's always been smacking like moon rocks failed me brass knuckle failed me a lot of cars fell me stiffy was good but I just didn't like I don't know yeah I don't know some rules every time I smokes dizzy my chest started hurting so yeah but they're consistent but um we're gonna try this one the mindo punch I don't know if you guys can see miss mindo punch [Music] press this two sides in and push up and looks like they did it right ether Springs on my [ __ ] [ __ ] oh I see yes the springs all right let me just take one more hit of this that Ursa Oh shit's good fighting online that's just good I like how the oh it tastes just cuz it tastes like straight wax I don't have my tripod that's why I'm doing this right now sorry see what he done bro neither did oh that [ __ ] is nice to be smoking in there sorry about the background noise dude I'm have to go with the car to be honest look beyond that why just cuz I like how it tastes like it's how the punishing I mean but I'm not gonna [ __ ] throw her and you know stood that the robber so I love mm I was like oh I gotta go because someone else hit me up and made me go to a

GI a triple excellent this is the a set of the diamond looking nice as we expected now let's take a look at the diamond alongside a 2.5 carat diamond alright so the 3 carat diamond is on the right on the left is a 2.5 that we have in stock it's actually a GI a triple excellent diamond but the a set it has what we call the ring of death you could kind of see the light leakage going on under the table that's that dark ring compared to this one we're getting more bright light return so it's interesting just goes to show you could have two diamonds graded the exact same score on paper but to the human eye or under video you know one could definitely outperform the other one now the diamonds on this LED light and you're gonna see once again the diamond on the right the three karat just totally outperforms the diamond on the left it also explains and shows how the a sets images go hand-in-hand to what you're gonna see in real life a lot of the time most of the time and since we're talking about ASA images this is the image of the other diamonds a set once again still G on a triple excellent but this image explains why we're seeing what we're seeing this is the diamonds under intense spotlight now this light you know it makes the diamonds shine really bright so you won't see as much of a difference between the two under this lighting condition although I definitely see some darkness in the diamond on the right compared to them I mean on the left compared to the one on the right and [Music] finally we're looking at the diamonds using natural daylight you could still see that ring on the diamond that's this one right here that's the ring of light leakage there the gh XXX live diamond does not have that and even from like angles you can kind of see the difference in brilliance this is the main diamond we're considering so I'm just gonna focus on this one a little bit spin it around for you it's an SI - and to the human eye it looks more like an SI one so you get a lot of value in that and at that it looks like a good si one so alright I hope this video helped speak to you soon", "jwonp6UWouo": "so y'all back again with that g13 let me get up close real

so no happy neolution still don't know one with diamonds around big they're still small and I blasted this 621 or put this in the freezer 621 since been in the freezer since 60 doing this is 13 ounces

bubbles anyway we'll swab all that out I'm using that with a hairdryer but after I mind the diamonds I put in the jar I mark the slough so so I call it just what's left over from my diamonds and then make these pills and that's what a mix with how much I use do not take more than one at a time you can make them stronger this is medium mix that's light mix I took three of them on a heavy mix and as overdose so be very careful it's this stuff even though after it's been mined after all the damage has been taken out it's still extremely potent now take this I'll put it in here put it in the

video I figured it would be awesome to do it outside alright man it's a beautiful day out today it's nice I mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost

"okay in this clip we're going to be taking a look at four for real honey's really in the inventory this is going to be a tough comparison because this again is not a comparison of the beautiful versus the ugly not by a long shot each of the diamonds in this clip and particularly the first two stones that we have here 154 HSI one on the Left versus a 159 hvs two on the right each of the diamonds in this clip we're going to be looking at full right smack dab in the GI AXA GS ideal zenith each of these diamonds is cut to a very serious level of precision and display very you know precise hearts and arrows optical symmetry and the finest and rarest optics you'll see when it comes to brightness and contrast which is what we're looking at now and also fire and sparkle which we're going to look at in a second these two stones now are two stones in our inventory that are both 159 hv s 2 s the diamond on the left is on the URL on wwe.com forward slash diamond forward slash 4833 the diamond on the right is for 866 both funnies yeah and then lastly here is a 170 is I one and other hearts and arrows stones in the inventory as well the lower girdles a little bit longer on this one maybe the arrows a little bit skinnier on the 170 but the brightness and contrast all old rocking the difference okay so here is the four stones with regards to brightness and contrast now we're going to look at fire and sparkle and again here's the 154 HSI one next to the 159 hvs too because with sparkle filter to beautiful pieces of eye candy okay now we're going to pull this is the other 159 hvs to next to the 170 is i won he doesn't like as your sparkle filter on these two guys both gorgeous all right so once again the first two 154 HSI one next to 159 hvs to diamond number 43 3 and sparkle and now his 159 hvs to diamond number for 866 alongside of 170 is I won first for fire then for Sparkle alright i hope that so", "Id_-Z7Hbn-g": "in early 90s the british design council a body that was found on 1944 to support the industrial recovery of britain after the war came up with a way to illustrate how designers solve problems in this video we are going to talk about what they come up with and how it shapes the way we understand design in our age we are going to talk about [Music] back then just like now design was understood as producing products like objects furniture clothes their goal was illustrating the process of design to show the value of structured problem solving and proving the importance of spending money on it by simplifying the process if you are new to the ux field or your job is becoming part of a digital product design process you might be overwhelmed by the concepts and lingo designers use these days like journeys and maps and user personas and things like that double diamond is a simple way to illustrate how these processes are placed on the overall design journey it is the most simple explanation to product design methodologies but beware it's not a linear process double diamond is just one of the definitions of design process and as you dive deeper into the ux world you will see that there are many other similar approaches the brilliance of double diamond is within its shape and how simple it turns one of the core values of design thinking and problem solving into a simple concept divergent and convergent thinking simply put the first part of the diamond shape indicates diverging thinking model which might be exploring new ideas or researching and finding new things and then the second part of it convenes in the conversion thinking model which is focusing on one part the problem to solve or deciding and prioritizing so you might ask how this applies to ux at all let's think about how you start a new project you do some research some less research or customer interviews and gather your insights to understand and then talk with your team decide on which direction to follow this process can be summarized like the divergent part of things and then converging to focus on one project and then once you decide your direction you start diverging again and this time you iterate over some design decisions and find the best possible solution to the problem double diamond itself is an iterative process at the end you find yourself in the beginning again the most recent version in british design consoles website shows that how you can start again after finishing the first iteration even after delivering the whole project you might find yourself in a new position which you also need to explore and answer the new upcoming problems another version that i found really useful was double diamond 2 by david nessler in his detailed diagram he dives deep into the messy design process and creates other little diamond diagrams inside the double diamond which explores the double diamond in a more detailed way but you have to accept that this isn't a road map or a game board that you can follow design is a messy business after all it's full of ideas emotions and rough conversations what double diamond tries to illustrate is that there's a method behind all this madness and we can categorize our structured problem solving skills okay thanks for watching all the way here and i hope i helped you learn a new thing today before i go i just want to round up everything we learned today double diamond is an outline of design thinking and problem solving activities a team or a designer goes through it is first created by british design console and one of many interpretations and explanations of design thinking process it illustrates the different phases of problem solving through divergent and convergent thinking processes double diamond process is iterative and one does not follow a straight line during the designing but instead goes through it like loops so this is all for the first video of my youtube channel thank you for watching it and i would appreciate if you leave comments below about double diamond and what you think and other design processes that you find useful likes and new subscriptions are always appreciated hope to see you soon bye", "PkU6fORI9iQ": "fine diamond jewelry from the

one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series

taffy diamonds sauce truth Gold Coast's this is their new sauce line and they're calling it diamonds with a Z and it's really just because the THC a chunks in it are really really fat and you'll see that here in the the close-ups as I stir it up tangey is kind of actually subdued by the smell of this apni which is kind of like Afghani oh yeah really really getting that that earthy kind of earthy kind of firm kind of hashey taste along with the tangi funk from DNA which is undeniable and when I was handed this and I was like ah Tandy I don't know I almost asked her different flavor because I feel like tangi is gonna overpower especially in a sauce any other flavor that it's mixed with and this stuff is actually a really even 5050 I was I was really pleasantly surprised by it yeah yeah the tangi scent and and terpene profile is just not it's not overpowering oh but the smell is so dank it is just so so fire yeah I could say outright as far as just a super strong Afghani funk and I concentrate this stuff is probably the loudest I've ever smelled any Afghani it's just reeks out of control yeah just like a spicy not I mean yeah kind of a peppery earthy really funky Cushie taste that's the best way I could describe Afghani ever had a hindu kush it's kind of similar to that this one is yeah the blend of tangi and happy is so big it just smells so fire together when I got this sauce from the booth looks at the underside of this lid and realized that a bunch of the Terp liquid soap into the the styrofoam was like [ __ ] you know so I messaged Gold Coast and I was like hey you might want to have a look at this packaging is I think this is a the very very first drop a release of their sauce so they responded right away and they were like hey yeah we noticed we definitely noticed that straightaway and we changed all the lids so you don't have to worry about that happening to you but unfortunately I think I lost a little bit of the Terps to this lid however I'm still a super flavorful sauce and and really be at the visual appeal of the thca chunks is awesome right guys going in on my first AB here of the taffy diamonds live resin sauce from Gold Coast extracts here in California got them from the booth at a chalice yeah it was really cool meeting you guys seeing the whole crew there yeah I mean really Gold Coast is easily one of my favorite companies you guys stuff is always kill I mean I really I love the white Walker a level the the canopy otic slavers you guys run and really really looking forward to exploring more flavors in this new sauce line which is just killer cheers guys [Laughter] oh man the tangi squeeze yeah the chunkiness of this is really really cool and it's a nice visual reminder or indicator of how much THC a is going into your dab whereas with a couple sauces I bought recently are just so runny that for all I know it's pretty much just mostly Terps and I like there to be some THC in there for sure so if you can visually see that you're dabbing giant chunks of THC you know it's kind of a no-brainer the high will come and with this stuff it is definitely no brainer tangi and the after you which is a pure indica so I'm Amy the hybrid nature of it is such a harsh contrast it's just that it's got the up nature of the tangi and then the full body buzz of the athletes yeah and the flavor is really really unique which is something that I guess as someone who loves concentrates I mean I'm always looking for new flavors this one the taffy yeah keep an eye out for this Oh killer get another tab here going in on a second dab here guys of the taffy diamond sauce from Gold Coast this is their new sauce line Gold Coast live resin that the diamonds big giant chunks of THC a yeah really really killer flavors on this concentrate [Music] I don't know if I mentioned it before but the readings on this nail are maybe not quite accurate this nail has presets or for a lot of different Lee nails so this one this one has a preset but the Sapphire preset I was told by the developers the email needs a little bit more work so the temperature is not quite accurate I think also I have my coil on this leg or modified I stretched the spring coil I kind of stretched it out with pliers so that it fits onto this thing really snug and that really makes a difference on the temperature to you that makes about sixty degrees of temperature difference so in summary you can basically add about sixty degrees to whatever number you're seeing here on the screen and that is the approximate temperature of my dabbing situation so I get that question a lot what what temperature do you set your email to and it's like it's tough because this you know it's really like it's preset based to your specific email so it's kind of like well if you don't have this liger with the Sapphire insert then what I set my email to is completely different than what is probably gonna give you an ideal experience but yeah I try my best yeah the eye from this is very much the harsh unless a harsh mixture but like a harsh contrast of Tangie which is very much an uplifting sativa high of the citrus turkey and profile and in Skunk and then the the half knee which is very much indica definitely giving me that Afghani funky vibe and the mixture of the two yeah it's just as its knocked out it isn't instant buzz hmm Anna and the Indyk that kind of creeps on you too if you do a few dabs of it so yeah I would highly recommend this one to anybody if you see this I haven't seen it in San Diego yet the the Gold Coast sauce but yeah I really hope it gets down here soon the diamonds with the Z the diamond sauce is so fire man and the chunkiness of it too yeah it's really a joy to deal with and the nose on it it is it is something a lot of sauce and it's it's really a joy to see that coming from big-name companies yeah just really really killer stuff that's gonna wrap up this episode of Turkey Tuesday this has been episode 52 again reviewing the tapi diamond sauce I got from Gold Coast booth when I was at chalice festival melting out the desert yeah next year I'm hoping it is somewhere that is more air-conditioned like a giant convention hall or something yeah the Gold Coast had their own building and and their booth was really badass so it was really really awesome to get a hold of this stuff and try it out and so glad I did yeah it just killer sauce I'll see you guys next week thank you so much for tuning in to the CCC 420 peace [Music]", "-DXzSMvK-bw": "[Music] oh gee could stuff business like throwing the twist sure didn't

a bunch of y'all [ __ ] let's roll my [ __ ] music while I finish this [ __ ] so I can educate y'all [ __ ] on natural diamonds versus CBDs hmm I'm kind of a big deal [Applause] let's say morning my beautiful people's you know who it is this your Boise City to the betta a now you may be thinking cool but why should I give a [ __ ] about CBDs or what they are because some of y'all [ __ ] may be wearing it as we speak and not know about it my name is Julius and I'm your twin brother obviously CC biddies are synthetically lab-created diamonds yes they are actual diamonds now this is all from a perspective from a non jeweller a consumer in enthusiasts I'm not an expert never claimed to be an expert I just know what I know cuz I know it what's the term I know a little bit about everything but a master of nothing that's just what it is now cv these are slightly controversial as there's some shady unethical jeweler's selling you CBD diamonds as naturally earth mined diamonds which is not the fact however they are still diamonds now CVD diamonds again are synthetically made in a laboratory essentially they take a diamond seed put some chemical gases all in a [ __ ] chamber and create a [ __ ] diamond as opposed to it being mined from the natural earth taking millions upon billions of years to create a [ __ ] stone which are becoming less and less available as time goes by and these diamond mines are being emptied out by everybody now CV these are controversial in the jewelry game there's a lot of jewelers that don't [ __ ] with CVD diamonds Daniel jewelry Inc which is my jeweler is one of them however he happens to have an example for me to use in comparison to natural earth mined diamonds now personally I'm gonna be completely transparent I don't have a problem with CVD diamonds they are still diamonds and if you're a vegan or you're one of the earth and think conflict diamonds are a bad thing and all that other [ __ ] because I mean it's children doing [ __ ] and people getting arms and legs chopped off for this [ __ ] I get your perspective and that might be your flow my problem with CVD diamonds lies in the unethical practices of jewelers cuz there's a lot of [ __ ] jewelers who are selling you these natural VVS yo this is vh1 yo these joints is flawless big diamonds they're diamonds but these aren't natural earth diamonds and these [ __ ] sell it as natural when they're not I don't have a problem with it because I know that there are diamonds but if I'm buying CBD diamonds I know I'm gonna be buying CBD diamonds but don't sell me C V DS or HP HTS and try to flip it as natural don't do that cuz you [ __ ] grimy now I'm gonna show you an example of two beautiful pieces one is naturally earth mined diamonds and the other one is CVD diamonds and I'm gonna see a little pop quiz for y'all [ __ ] leave the comment below which one you think is the natural one ready here are the two pieces they're both pillow type pendants and they're both with diamonds one is CBD and one is natural we'll show you a close-up of them and then you tell me if this one is CVD or this one is CVD here's the close-up here's the other which one is it ready if you guys guess this one you were correct this one is the CVD one and this one is the naturally earth mine diamonds now as you can see they're really [ __ ] similar I mean honestly they're very very similar color carat quality that might differ but they look the same and actually happens when we take the CBD pendant and you're in the jewelry shop and he's like yo this is the flyer ship II this is that pillow pendant VB yes f1 clarity all that good [ __ ] warm sayings like yo see my sis official bee and he hits it with the Diamonds ass then what happens what test diamond doesn't it because it is a [ __ ] diamond that's how these scumbags can get you that's when the ethical play comes into picture now let me test the other one just so you can see diamond they both test diamond because they are actual diamonds but one is synthetically made in a laboratory and one is mined from the earth but there is one specific machine that will shout this [ __ ] out real quick that a lot of jewelers are starting to get it isn't a cheap machine it ranges anywhere from ten to twenty thousand dollars and it's called the Sherlock Holmes now I'm gonna show you an example of what the difference is under the Sherlock Holmes machine between natural and CVD now what this machine does it does its full detective work and what it does is scans the actual pendants and stones to determine if they're CV DS or their lab diamonds if their lab diamonds they're gonna fire up red like the burning sun in the double scrotum and if they turn blue then they're all natural diamonds let's take a look he read like The Devil's anus and his hemorrhoids BAM Balu like the beautiful sky and the honesty and ethics of their new jewellery so again you got a beautiful example of natural diamonds but don't get jerked by cv D's and natural diamonds unless you're specifically looking for cv DS I don't know the price of Ripper let's say for example this pendant would be $1200 this one may be $800 they can both be based on 10 14 18 22 karat gold but again CV DS will be way cheaper than naturally earth mined diamonds and that's what I'm saying I'm not too pissed about CV DS as long as there's transparency and clarity I don't mind them I don't own any cuz I've checked but I don't specifically mine them as long as you're selling it to me as a CVD thanks to Daniel jewelry Inc for providing me with both examples so I could show y'all [ __ ] Daniel jewelry Inc does not and I repeat does not sell cv DS I've even asked I was like yo would you make me a CBP piece and he kind of looked at me sideways like with a crooked face like what the [ __ ] you just said and that's fine I mean there's a lot of jewelers that won't do it and there's a lot of jewelers that won't do it in front of your face but I'll do it behind your back and I love your [ __ ] in the heart did you sit in this pendant or this pendant just leave a comment below and I'll put you in contact with any jewelry Inc you can ask I'm pricing and all that beautiful [ __ ] now see ya [ __ ] next time you know what is this the biggest in the game educating your [ __ ] while on whiskey smooches [Music] don't [Music]", "OI4eHrhmVjE": "oh you guys want a big Dan over here coming back at you yeah and uh once again we're gonna go over THC diamonds and uh yeah let's get to it so uh a lot a lot a lot of people been asking me all kinds of questions all that stuff I guess some of you guys really don't even know what it is I see a lot of different questions different comments and I just wanted to go over it I've got a fresh fresh batch right here just put that down get better lighting so basically what you're looking at is high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract or HCF se now there is a high Torpy full-spectrum extract that is very similar but that's basically just the the tur Playa poured off this is just the cannabinoid portion which is our mainly THC a so yeah guys uh a lot of questions on how it's made if you can make it without dewaxing if you can make it without a closed loop system if what exactly is it what's the difference between this and Shatter is that contaminants left all that stuff so I'll try to go over a few questions and answer them the best I can [Applause] first thing there is no contaminants this is fully d waxed at negative 50 degrees using dry ice in the columns now some of you guys might not be familiar with B HOH extractions in general and if that's the case don't don't try making this stuff again if you only have trim or you know like a zip or something like that a flower don't don't waste your time making this stuff you definitely need enough of Fayum material to make diamonds this right here is about a hundred grams and I've been using my six inch by 36 inch column which fits five pounds in the closed-loop system so it's a fairly big common material column so I do run a lot of flowers you know what I mean and I do I do a live run I don't fresh no fresh frozen none of that basically and you can mix trains this is a couple of different strains in here and when I do Fino hunts and I say you can't get a full unit off of a female like a few plants or whatever then you got like 40 different strains growing and you don't just want you know a few zips here a few zips there you just want you know straight units to do what you got to do I'll end up just running it all just like this and making a mixed batch it provides great flavor especially if you mix in like Heitor P strain with a high THC strain you could get some great results just taking a few puffs and so bear with me guys if I if I take a little pause or just taking a few puffs but um yeah so the main thing is is there's no containment it's we're running this do you wax with a two micron lab filter so um and we're running all clean great perfectly indoor flowers no pesticides none of that stuff I don't even now spray foliar sprays at all not even in veg I just don't see a need for foliar sprays but that's a whole nother subject so yeah that that's that process as far that as that goes now can you just make shatter and then turn turn it into this I'm not sure I don't do that maybe you could get like a zip a shadow throw it in a jar spray some butane in it let it sit and it might stop crystal getting some crystals in there and reform and seems like a possibility I think the science behind it will work but um that's not how we do it and to get you know to get better results like this with a nice gold interrupts and a clarity on your diamonds you're gonna need a high end flowers and fresh is best it contains more chirps and also the the trichome heads ain't all [ __ ] up and smushed and shakin around and beat up so those fresh heads definitely uh definitely cause good diamonds to form you know what I mean so if you got all your nice fresh heads everything's nice then you're gonna end up with a nice product like this now as far as making this without dewaxing I'm sure it's possible I think if you leave the lipids and the waxes in there I think the diamonds form more jaggedy and I think the lipids and stuff will stick to the diamond so you won't get such a pure product and your diamonds will contain those waxes will end up sticking to them and stuff like that so it is what it is as far as open blasting right into a jar I'm sure it couldn't be done again I don't see why not you know you're doing the same method just way too deep waxing and close up system it's just like a little bit better so I'm sure you know people at home still doing that old tech with glass tubes or whatever they're doing I'm sure it could be done that way as well but again guys if you're only running little runs and you just you know got a blast like a zip into a small jar you know you might get a little crystal formation but at the end of the day you know who wants to waste two weeks just to get like a gram or something like that so I don't see that very uh you know very uh worth doing but um anyways yeah so basic method you know you take your take your collection pop dump it into a jar leave some butane in there make sure it's soupy make sure it has enough of butane and then basically you could do it in room temp dried ice whatever you want just say your jar over there and don't [ __ ] with it and after five days you'll start seeing a little bit of crystals growing at the bottom and then after 14 days you'll have the biggest diamonds that your product will produce which all is strain dependant it's all up to the strain around how high the THC is and stuff like that now again the crystals that you see are THCA and the source that you see is uh cannabinoids and turkeys so the sauce will contain CBD CBG cbn ta CB and a bunch of other cannabinoids as well as your terpenes like lemonade mersin piney and stuff like that so I hope this helps explain I know there's a lot of questions about it and I know you guys are you know there's not a lot of people sharing sharing the info but basically the Diamonds just formed wit time it doesn't really have anything to do a pressure or anything like that as far as residual solvents you can't take this in vac it again when it's done like you could take these and just pop it in the back at that point you're just pretty much backing off terpenes after 14 days and at room temperature and there is uh under 100 ppm s of residual solvents left now in most states is a 5000 ppm limit so again 100 ppm s is like nothing and your shatter your wax probably has more butane trapped in it then this stuff does some people like to say the bigger diamonds do trap more butane I find that it's not the case and that's through different testing from different labs stuff like that anything that goes out has to be tested has to pass especially in the recreational market so yeah as far as residual solvents yeah there's no I'm confident to say there's no residual solvents that will not pass a test I'm not the only one making this stuff there's plenty of people out here doing it um I'm just basically the only one showing you how it's done and not been in top secret I feel like it's not a big deal again I made the first diamonds myself by accident by storing runs when you're doing lots of runs sometimes you don't have room in your back chamber so you'll dump it in a jar and you'll see you jaws out in a cooler or somewhere in the fridge or wherever you keep them and you'll you know you'll keep those in fact those another day and then when you're doing multiple runs you might have 16 20 jars stashed up and some may sit for a week or so and then uh yeah after a week I started noticing that it's not separate and looking a little weird and then now when I dumped it out to vac it I noticed that there was a big tarp layer really liquidy and then I noticed that there was big chunks of crystals and I was like Gil what what the [ __ ] is that and after further examining it I noticed that those are straight Tac egg diamonds and um yeah basically that's how that's how a lot of us figured it out that's how I myself figured it out by accident and um ya know again you can take all these diamonds out and wash that with pentane or something like that and then purge that off and just have have your have your Terps in a different layer and your diamonds in a different layer but this is a full spectrum extract so it hasn't been separated I didn't make diamonds and then added Terps back in or anything like that this is just full spectrum from the plants so you get every single thing that's in the actual flower that you wanted that makes for a more pleasurable smoking experience and I think that's right now I think this is the most superior extract on the market and it speaks for itself so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video smash the like button if it helps you out if you like it subscribe share comment holler at your boy and any questions just when I'm in the comments visit the store he mailed me do whatever you got to do and I'm always here to help so I hope that explains everything guys big Dan over and out peace out fellas [Music] [Music]", "gjZmofNzxJw": "all right in this video with taking a peek at two diamonds with really very comparable optics on what the slightly different slightly different on the Left we have a carat 51 HSI one here in the inventory beautiful diamonds both of these diamonds by the way fall in the zenith of the GI a xxx AGS ideal zone okay I'd say you know when we're looking at them here in diffuse lighting I think the the carrot and a half H s I want a little bit more contrast II okay where is the this diamond here on the right is a carat 58 is i1 here another diamond precision optics like performance and the gix AGS ideals this one here seems to be showing like a little bit more bright reflections going around the perimeter this one here a more distinct pattern of bright and dark reflections going around the perimeter of the diamond both of them great examples of top-of-the-line optics and round brilliant cut diamonds because they both fall in that zenith yet you have two different personalities going on here within the two round diamonds okay so this is your appearance in diffused lighting and look at them in spotlighting see if we see any difference in Sparkle scintillation both of these you got good broad flash popping off of the pavilion mains which would be your arrow facets you could see it happening in both diamonds okay and then you got also have coupled in there your pin fire flash as well yeah trying to get it without glare very nice let's put them in stronger spotlighting as well you know slight nuances in difference of appearance here as well okay now let me see this well now both of them agreed like it's hard to pick a favorite between the two but there is a little bit of difference between the two you may want to watch this video back without my commentary okay and just let your eyes do the talking it's both beautiful but slight differences in your fire and sparkle patterning but both of them are doing it phenomenally okay we're proud to represent both of these and back both of these with lifetime policies so safe bet either way and to wrap this up though you know since the we did see some nuances and difference in diffuse lighting we're gonna bring these into natural daylight as well okay but Wow two beautiful pieces eye candy here these two again okay let's see a little bit of this similar yeah you can see the similar kind of comparison here in natural ambient daylight as well there's more of a distinct bright dark bright dark contrast pattern in this Garrett and half HSI one then in the 158 is I one but again two beautiful diamonds - absolutely gorgeous one you can't go wrong either way all right you now just have to ask yourself if there is an appearance that you prefer over the other okay and that wraps this video up I hope it salt but very nice display of to Jim thanks for watching you", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "7ImLugrlzCM": "what's good guys this video is intended for people over the age of 18. so if you're not over 18 just do me a solid head out for me and if you are over 18 do not try this at home [Music] [Music] all right what's good [ __ ] people welcome back to another episode of ouija kitchen the series where i we educate you guys on we it's a good time so today what we're talking about is we're talking about this little [ __ ] right here thc a you might be asking yo what the [ __ ] is thca which is probably why you clicked on the video so basically what i'm going to do is i'm just going to give you all the basic wrap around of what thca is how it works what it does i'm not going to go into too deep of detail or anything but the videos i used to teach me i'm a link in the description so they can teach you if you want to know more about this stuff but i'm going to about to give you all the spark notes version the version where you would use to cheat because you didn't read the full thing you read the full book so you're here okay welcome now what is thca it's not thc per se so thcaa is basically the same thing as thc except acid on the end thca is considered the rawest form of thc the only difference is with thca with what it is just like this just like this powder form if you consume it if i take this and i [ __ ] eat it you won't get high you'll get every single benefit that you'll feel from thc but it's just non-psychoactive so you won't feel high you won't you won't get that brain sensation of oh [ __ ] i'm feeling really high if you just straight straight up [ __ ] consume this so the reason why that is is it kind of goes into how it's made so there's these little frosty tips on bud it's the part that gets you high that's the thcm they're called trichome heads and these trichome heads before they're dried out when the bud is still moist and it's still when it's still kind of like a growing plant these are thc a they have not become thc there's this process called curing and it dries out the bud and in that process that's when thca becomes thc so you might be asking yourself why the why would you buy that why would you pay why is it 75 dollars for this because when this when you add heat to this and this is burned in let's say a bowl of anger the thca the as the a kind of just [ __ ] goes [ __ ] away and it becomes thc and when you burn the thca that a going away is called decarboxylation so basically if we do this math right in this box we have 99.9 thca so if the thca in this is 99 and when you get thca and you add heat you get thc so basically you [ __ ] got like 99 thc which is the [ __ ] [ __ ] [Music] so just like you guys saw in the beginning of this video you can [ __ ] dab this [ __ ] all you got to do is take a little bit of a little bit of some concentrate of whatever kind it doesn't really matter yeah just get a little [ __ ] poo poo with that then you get the thca this is hard because it's like white and white it's kind of [ __ ] up but whatever you you can just [ __ ] dab it like normal so um yeah cheers everybody [Music] oh [Music] very very nice so you might be asking yourself how does one get from said moist blood to [ __ ] thca powder this is honestly one of the best parts about this because this [ __ ] to get this it's all solventless there's no butane propane nothing like that no other solvents are needed to get that to get thca i don't know if you've ever seen rosin pressing but basically what you do is they take a bag put a bunch of [ __ ] butt in it and you squeeze it between two hot plates and that squeezes all the juices out you get it to just the right temperature and just the right pressure that it squeezes all of the juices out of the bud and you get this [ __ ] they're basically dabs you can dab this and get you high as [ __ ] it's super clean super tasty so now once you have this yield of concentrate you take the concentrate press it again make it super flat you fold it up a bunch of [ __ ] times and you put it into a very very fine mesh little screen bag that you just stick the concentrate right in and then you just do the process again you just keep pressing it and pressing it and then eventually what you're left with is is a dried up like powder and that's just straight this which is just straight pure thca and like it's kind of confusing because it's like ah when you hear thc you're like oh that's not thc i don't [ __ ] want that in this [ __ ] state it's all thca it doesn't get too high but once you heat it up and you put it in a bowl a banger whatever you want and you heat it up it becomes thc because that again that a just [ __ ] goes away and the cool thing about this is that you can you have both options you can smoke it and get incredibly high or you can just eat it and it'll be good you just won't be high you'll get all the physical effects so actually i'm i don't know how much they recommend so what i do is i kind of lick my finger take a little dip in the powder right it doesn't taste like anything like there's a faint taste of how it smells and it smells like it smells like weed but yeah i tried looking up like what the dosage was it doesn't even tell me on this on the little [ __ ] container it came with it was kind of [ __ ] up i'm pretty sure you can dab just the powder which i'm kind of down to try right now i got a little bit of [ __ ] nut on the dabber so i'll just uh like this [ __ ] bro like that oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] that all up man station yo oh that's chill right there i'm done with that i don't know what 10 people to take is that so we're going to dab i don't know [Music] oh [ __ ] okay [Music] the answer is yes [Music] so now the question is is it worth it is it worth [ __ ] 75 dollars um no the only reason i got this was because i had a coupon i would i wouldn't pay 75 dollars for that but i mean hey it might be worth it to some people i'm i'm really high 75 maybe just because i'm not i'm not balling like that maybe i maybe maybe i'm just a [ __ ] all right there's only one thing left we have to [ __ ] do get off [ __ ] what are the chances not too bad of a bowl appreciate you guys for just being alive yeah thca um seven out of ten seven point five out of ten good stuff see you i choked it not wednesday i might see you on wednesday i'm trying to see you on wednesday maybe we can see each other [Music] haha [Music] you", "3SQOSX7-Pkk": "so what is THC a and how is it different than THC it's actually really simple THC a is simply THC that has not been activated yet it means it hasn't been heated or hasn't aged long enough to convert into tetrahydrocannabinol it is an unaccented form of THC now this type of THC has its medicinal benefits it's one of the reasons people like to juice cannabis is to get the THC a into their system but this product is actually meant to be converted into THC either through using a vaporizer or you know you can even put this mix this with flour into a joint or a cone or something like that which is how I prefer to actually use it but what is so special about this product how is it different than all these other products but he's gonna look at that real quick this is flour right so many of you know that flour is not also not activated you have to heat this that's why we smoke the flour and we don't just check it that's why am i chewing on these these little buds right now so nice lift so this is actually when you buy this and you look at the side and it says THC on there it's actually kind of a misnomer it's not actually th see what your that number is is the amount of THC that will come out of this once it's heated or once it ages for a certain amount of time so the note that number you get that number by measuring the amount of THC a and the flower and doing a little math equation and the math equation is very simple you're actually just multiplying it by about 0.8 seven so it looks like point eight seven seven seven forever but it's it's about point eight seven and then you multiply it by that number and that's the kind of loss that you're gonna get you're gonna lose about you know 13% or so in that process so then you'll have your THC number so I hope that makes sense I want to show you one other product this is the other product from true we've called true powder now this is the opposite of this product now this product is activated and it's in a powder form I want to show that to you this is the powder form of activated THC and it's mixed with some other stuff to give it a little more so it's not easy gonna get a giant dose at a time you don't have to use a tiny quarter teaspoon you can use this big scooper so this is activated THC which means you can eat this I can chug this I can put it in my drink I can and ingest this and it will affect me this right this is the pucky a string and from truly blue river terpenes right this is also kind of like a powder form of a powder it smells amazing right and this is actually not activated I couldn't chug this can't put this into a drink this has to be heated up put it into a joint or put into a day break or you know buy you like to use my puffs go for stuff like that so that is the difference between THC a and THC so I bet you didn't know that you were actually buying THC a when you went in Boyd flower true clear is another form of THC that you're buying because it's already activated you can eat true clear and it is activated the true posits these are this is activated THC in here this is this sunshine cush pod if you were to open this up you can eat it this is totally edible so the TFC a product is not edible you actually have to heat that up and I am going to take some of this I'm going to sprinkle it into a joint later on and it is going to be is going to make head joint fire because but the best the best thing about this is that it will increase the amount of THC in your flower if you sprinkle it on top if you roll it up with it and it won't become like sticky and stuff like all over the outside of it so if you see anything that that we've done before we like to add some distillate sometimes to our stuff and this will actually allow us to do that a little bit better so if you have flour that you really like the terpene profile of and it doesn't have a lot of THC this is a great way to add THC to the flour and that you're already using so you love a strain but you have to smoke too much of it I'm saying somebody says you're going up ten percent THC so you just want to buy a lower tier so you maybe you want to pay a little bit less you can add some of this air to it and it will make it more potent so hope that was helpful and like it subscribe", "K1_QlujFaBE": "[Music] what is up

for you today I'm going to be looking at three two carat diamonds this first one a little over 2 carats a GV s 2 now this round brilliant cut is a GI a XXX it also qualifies for a GS ideal optics however I will say it just eeks into the AGS ideal optic zone there are some areas of weak light returned under the table one notable area of leakage which you'll see in the a set and fire scope images on our site and is exhibiting a little more darkness under the table which we can visibly see all right the diamond next to it is a diamond in the 2.1 X carrot range a GV s one beautiful optical symmetry on it a better angle combination and produces much more it produces more white light return unto the table which you can see so these are two diamonds that you know it they're interestingly enough they both qualify as the GI a XXX AGS ideal zone but the diamond on the left the GPS to kind of falls on the outskirts but at the same time it does come in and is valued accordingly alright it's going to be the least expensive of the lot I should also say the yes the diamond on the right is a vs1 a beautiful clean vs one and which leads up to the third diamond which is another diamond in the 2.1 X carrot range another GV s 1 the primary differences between these two diamonds now these second two diamonds both of these 2.1 X carrot there in the 22 point teens both GV s ones this diamond here has a table size that's a little bit bigger than the table size on this diamond all right and you really is to say one is more beautiful than the other would be a mistake but the table on the diamond on the Left falls at fifty-seven percent in the diamond on the right Foles at fifty-five percent okay so even though there's only a two percent difference there we can visibly see that difference between the two of these I have a personal preference for one over the other personally but once again that's personal you may like the one on the left more another person may like the one on the right more they're both gorgeous all right both of these are spectacular safely full in the GI AXA GS I GI ax AGS ideal zone for their optics and exhibit the most beautiful optics attainable in round brilliant cuts okay and there's all three of them side by side so just before we head into spotlighting the diamond on the far left would persuade me um if I was really looking maybe to save the most money out of this batch okay because that one comes in at the lowest price of the three but if I was picking for optics it would boil down between these two personally all right and you'll talk with your sales associate who I believe he's David about what you want to do between these two all right let's go into spotlighting all right we starting off in the dimmer spot lighting environment here and right off the bat well this is at the tilt angle here okay you can see the diamonds on the the two diamonds on the right are really banging out the optics beautifully is it the tilt angle let's see when we go into the face of these two diamonds ok that the diamond on the left is lightened up nice both of these diamonds lighting up nice okay when we when we come into the face up view all right actually all three of them you can see you can see those strongest bursts of fire that popping off of the arrow facets or the pavilion mains i should say okay beautiful all right so all three of these have optical properties in spotlighting that would make the highest grades in GI a and AGS as well let's go into stronger spotlighting okay and let's just move in the spot lighting over on top of the diamonds as they're tilted at an angle but this is a real light show here and as we rock and tilt they're all each one of these is lightened up like a Christmas tree okay so I don't know if there's any clear nod i would give to one over the other but in all frankness i tend to fancy the the diamond on the font right i do like the smaller table on that one that I'm really exhibiting some amazing fire and sparkle but all three of these in fairness are exhibiting amazing fire and sparkle okay so yeah you may want to watch this video back um maybe look at the differences in table sizes between these last two diamonds see if there's one you prefer over the other okay they're both they both lighten up like Christmas trees though alright and there you go alright I thought we'd wrap this video up here by the window in the same order this is the two carat GBS to all right and by the window definitely looks better than did in the indoor diffuse all right beautiful beautiful beautiful this however is the first of the this one with this the 57% table in the two carat GBS 12.1 X carrot GBS one all right and I can see some optical differences between the two and I believe we're capturing it for you here although i'm going to tell you this isn't you know this isn't something i throw away here that's for sure yeah i'm being super particular and i'm pointing out things the average layman's not gonna see if he wasn't doing the side-by-side comparison all right so I'm gonna put this one down now now that you've seen this one okay and not by no means up not saying this is ugly by any definition of the word but I definitely see the edge in the one on the right ok so I'm going to put this guy down for a second okay and then here is the 57% table on my left next to the 55 table on my right okay both outstanding outstanding diamonds both of these diamonds representing the rarest and most beautiful optical properties to be had when it comes to round brilliant diamond cutter okay so you're safe here with either one of these guys beautiful optical symmetry on both of them beautiful patterning of you know hearts and arrows I mean they're just you can't go wrong there alright and that's gonna wrap this video up the today thank you for watching you guys learned about diamonds hit subscribe in the upper left-hand side of the screen and learned off as we published thank you for watching", "PZ2e7mxGN-I": "okay we're looking at two round brilliant cuts here both of these diamonds are GI a triple exes all right both of these diamonds are near colorless and both of them are SI toos okay so what we're looking at in this video really now is a comparison of both optics and clarity okay this camera that I use and the quality of the lens is as an uncanny ability of capturing inclusions sometimes even that we can't see with our I but sometimes we can all right and I'm just going to kind of tell you as you can see as we're looking at these two diamonds the diamond on the left and the diamond on the right have very similar optics in the sensitive both GI a triple X's with AGS ideal life performance but the transparency of the diamond on the left looks better to me all right all right in the clip here looking through the lens i think i can make out some boo-boos in the one on the right okay so this is looking in diffuse lighting and you can see it both bright stones great distribution of contrast there bright and dark reflections it's happening ok let's look at Sparkle ok is the sparkle scintillation of these guys ok both of them have beautiful Sparkle ok they both kicking it back alright we're going to look in stronger spotlighting now okay now as i'm here in the stronger spotlighting environment i'm not sure if you can see it or not but i can see the better transparency I mean don't get me on both of these are kicking back magnificent fire and sparkle both of these diamonds got the optics but the one on the left the crystal looks more transparent to me than the one on the right I could see little hit it looks like there may be a little haziness in that one on the right so for me that would make me go for the one on the left and of the two diamonds that we're looking at that are near colorless I believe that's the higher color of the two as well although both of them a white diamond okay we're going to do a final look by the window as well alrighty and as we hit by the window looking at these two two and a half carats it is I'm going to say it is tougher to see differences in the clarity here by the window both of these are super bright stones magnificent feeling I'm not sure if the camera is able to pick up any differences in transparency between these two SI toos but both of these shining like the site they're both looking good but overall then okay just you know when you take into account all of the lighting environments that we examine these 2n I still kind of would give lean with a nod to the diamond on the left okay and if I'm not mistaken that stone is the G color and the dining on the right h ok alright so that wraps up this video to beautiful hunk in two-and-a-half

you who don't know I make medicinal marijuana extraction and smoking videos I post them on the internet for other people to watch and joy smoke along with and simply learn something sorry for the lack of videos for three years ish I've seen all of your comments requesting comebacks just hasn't been something I've been able to do but figured I'd show you guys this video damn that's a thumbnail right there alright so how to cross th CA out of your BHO mixture the difference in making diamonds from shatter so for shatter you're gonna pour your goopy Taney mixture onto parchment paper and you're gonna throw it in the vacuum chamber and you're gonna let it be gas for like a few minutes if you want and then essentially pull it back then you just flip the slab over and over for the8 diamonds you're going to instead of parchment you're gonna put in a jar I'm not really sure what is this jar is Harrison in my hand when it went into the freezer was probably about three-quarters full with solvent and it's sat there for 48 hours just in this container with some 99 isopropanol and then I took it out put the jar right here let it sit for like 10 minutes I noticed everything that was at the bottom basically dissolved back into the mixture so then after like 10 minutes or so of degassing at room temp it would have been down maybe a little bit more like just over half or something so I'm noticing that pretty much as the solvent breaks down maybe not this time because it's so chunky but as the solvent breaks down everything that crashes out has been redesign back into the solvent and I'm not sure if that's how you're gonna get a big VVS diamond or if that's how it's just gonna be one big chunk across the bottom regardless the only difference in making shatter to thca diamonds is you're going to instead of parchment throw it in a jar pressure doesn't really have anything to do with it from what I've been reading and understanding it has a lot to do with that initial cold crash [Music] some people say like online that you only need to do it for like 12 to 24 hours this is after like six days of reducing the solvent it was some people might say like could have reduced more solvent before doing the initial crash and it wouldn't have taken so long in the freezer but it like it's it's not about the headspace it's about your saturation to evaporation ratio and I wanted to keep it super saturated to like just crash out anything I possibly could because I  this up like six times now one of the first times I ever did a batch of diamonds it went really really well actually the very first time I can't focus on the bottom there and then pretty much every time since I seem to read as all the THC a back into it and get some super small diamonds this is open blasting waxes fats and lipids are fully intact and it's nine different strains so that contradicts most things that you read online I'm sorry guys I just cannot focus on the bottom there regardless I'm gonna cap it and throw it back in the freezer now let it crash for maybe another 1224 hours or so yeah I guess I'll be like part two or something I don't know okay bye", "kZLSUxZ2WNY": "[Music] we
